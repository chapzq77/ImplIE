1	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Two armed robbers who raped a Zimbabwean lawmaker during a break- in at her home were each sentenced to 29 years in prison, state media reported Thursday.
2	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Lovemore Mumvuri, 37, and Shepherd Ngulube, 31, sentenced to 15 years each for rape and 14 years for armed robbery, the state-run Herald said.
3	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	The sentences will be consecutive.
4	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Angeline Sithole said the pair used an axe to break into the MP's home to the east of Harare, and then ransacked the house before taking turns to rape the lawmaker who represents the ruling ZANU-PF party.
5	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	They made off with various property including a hi-fi, pots, pans, mobile phones and blankets altogether worth 37 million Zimbabwean dollars (150,000 US dollars).
6	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Some of the property was recovered in neighbouring Mozambique.
7	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Sentencing the pair, regional magistrate Gladys Pise said: "Rape is a very grave offence, especially in this case when it is committed on a respected member of society and you did not (only) demean and traumatise her, but shocked her as well."
8	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	The two robbers are also facing other charges including one of gang-raping a 13 -year-old schoolgirl who later died while waiting to be treated at a local clinic and killing a security guard.

11	AFP_ENG_20080719.0301.LDC2009T13	The pope arrived at 7:15 pm (0915 GMT) to a rapturous welcome, waving to the crowd to religious music.
12	AFP_ENG_20080719.0301.LDC2009T13	Organisers said more than 200,000 young Catholics would gather at the Royal Randwick Racecourse in eastern Sydney where the pontiff was to address a prayer session, as the world's largest Christian festival approaches its conclusion.
13	AFP_ENG_20080719.0301.LDC2009T13	A giant cross overshadowed the stage where Pope Benedict was to address the crowd, where dancers dressed in white performed ahead of his arrival, to the sound of religious songs.

16	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	TBILISI, Georgia 2007-10-09 10:57:04 UTC
17	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgia's former defense minister was freed on a multimillion- dollar bail early Tuesday after retracting his accusations against the president and left the country, news reports said.
18	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Irakly Okruashvili was arrested Sept. 27, the day after he accused President Mikhail Saakashvili of a murder plot and corruption -- allegations Saakashvili dismissed as "unpardonable lies."
19	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was charged with extortion, money-laundering and abuse of power.
20	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Nika Gvaramia, Georgia's deputy chief prosecutor, said Okruashvili had retracted his accusations and admitted he made them for political purposes.
21	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Gvaramia also said that Okruashvili had pleaded guilty to charges of extortion and failure to properly perform his duties.
22	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgian television stations on Monday broadcast footage of the questioning in which Okruashvili retracted his accusations.
23	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili, wearing a track suit, looked tense and tired but spoke clearly.
24	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	A court in the capital, Tbilisi, ruled Monday to free Okruashvili on bail equivalent to US$6 million (euro4.3 million).
25	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was freed overnight after he produced the money and was escorted home by police.
26	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	He refused to answer reporters' questions.
27	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Later Tuesday, the Georgian Pirveli news agency quoted Okruashvili's bodyguards as saying he had left the country with his family.
28	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Keti Chomakhishvili who was in charge of Okruashvili's case couldn't confirm that he went abroad, but said it could be part of an arrangement with authorities.
29	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was a longtime Saakashvili ally who served as his defense minister until late last year.
30	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	His accusations and arrest have thrown the ex-Soviet nation into its worst political turmoil since Saakashvili was propelled to power in the 2003 uprising known as the Rose Revolution.
31	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Opposition leaders said Monday that Okruashvili had been forced into making his statement and promised to go ahead with protests demanding Saakashvili's ouster.

53	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT
54	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	PARIS
55	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
56	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
57	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
58	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But they say the plan would also impose international supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority.
59	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
60	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to the plan.
61	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna.
62	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.
63	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mission governing the territory would be replaced by another international organization that would have executive powers to any annul legislation that breaches Kosovo's obligations under U.N. agreements, diplomats said.
64	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
65	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
66	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari handed his recommendations to representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia during a meeting in Vienna, Austria.
67	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	It will be presented to the Serbian and Kosovo governments on Feb. 2.
68	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
69	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.
70	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Russia, which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo as a province, wants the Security Council vote delayed until Serbia has formed a government, diplomats in Vienna say.
71	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	POPE TRYING TO CONVERT JEWISH ' ELDER BROTHERS '
72	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
73	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The pope could easily lose the respect his office deserves by the divisive decisions he has recently made.
74	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He offended the Jewish community directly and, indirectly, insulted every thoughtful person.
75	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Save that such actions are tragic for the church and the world, they would be quickly dismissed in any rational consideration of the church catholic.
76	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Quite appropriately, Benedict XVI seeks the respect of the world as leader of more than a billion Catholics.
77	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He behaves, however, as if he were running an exclusive club with no need to consider the sensibilities or intelligence of that world.
78	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."
79	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	That is such an affront to the Jewish community that the international assembly of Conservative Rabbis meeting this week is considering a resolution to condemn the prayer for endangering the mutual respect engendered in recent years.
80	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope's revised prayer would undo much of the good will that his predecessor, John Paul II, did for Jewish relations.
81	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	John Paul called Jews his "elder brothers" in the faith.
82	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Benedict wants to convert them.
83	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He seems intent to undo the remarkable work of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s to engage the contemporary world.
84	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He declared a plenary indulgence for anyone who visits the French shrine at Lourdes during its 150th anniversary this year.
85	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	That kind of spiritual abuse triggered the 16th-century Protestant reformation.
86	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Luther objected to indulgences offered by Pope Leo X in exchange for money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
87	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	A plenary indulgence allows the faithful to bypass purgatory, escape God's judgment and proceed directly to heaven.
88	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Playing games with the souls of the faithful worked for a while in the Middle Ages, but since Luther it has been seen for what it is: A fund-raising marketing tool that mocks the mission of the church, the theology of Scripture and the justice of God.
89	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope needs to choose the role he wants to play.
90	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can act the cult leader catering to the emotional needs of his followers and the power lust of his institution.
91	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can take a responsible place in the world's religious community, embrace his "elder brothers" and give up the indulgence fantasies.
92	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can't do both.

120	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)
121	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon reiterated on Tuesday that the UN mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, will continue to operate in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244.
122	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, UNMIK continues to operate on the understanding that resolution 1244 ( 1999) remains in force, unless the Security Council decides otherwise," Ban said in his latest report on the work of UNMIK to the Security Council.
123	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The secretary-general said Kosovo's declaration of independence and subsequent events have posed significant challenges to UNMIK's ability to exercise its administrative authority in Kosovo.
124	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant operational implications for UNMIK," he said.
125	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Pending Security Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground in a manner consistent with the operational framework established under resolution 1244," he said.
126	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."
127	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	But he stressed that any violence, whether directed at UNMIK personnel or facilities or against members of any of Kosovo's communities, is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.
128	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region.
129	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	He concluded by saying that the UN's efforts in Kosovo are aimed at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo and the wider region remains stable, and that the safety and security of the population are preserved.
130	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	Adopted in June 1999, resolution 1244 recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and puts the breakaway province under UN administration.
