47	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	March 12, 2004: Law enforcement authorities offer a $100,000 reward for information leading to the "resolution of the investigation" into Luna's death.
48	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	They also announce that they are investigating whether it's possible that Luna stabbed himself.
49	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	Dec. 2, 2004: The Baltimore FBI office releases a statement concluding that Luna was alone from the time he left his courthouse office to the time his body was found.

54	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	PARIS
56	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
57	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
62	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.
64	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
65	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
68	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
69	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.

73	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The pope could easily lose the respect his office deserves by the divisive decisions he has recently made.
77	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He behaves, however, as if he were running an exclusive club with no need to consider the sensibilities or intelligence of that world.
78	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."
81	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	John Paul called Jews his "elder brothers" in the faith.

83	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He seems intent to undo the remarkable work of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s to engage the contemporary world.
86	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Luther objected to indulgences offered by Pope Leo X in exchange for money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
87	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	A plenary indulgence allows the faithful to bypass purgatory, escape God's judgment and proceed directly to heaven.
88	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Playing games with the souls of the faithful worked for a while in the Middle Ages, but since Luther it has been seen for what it is: A fund-raising marketing tool that mocks the mission of the church, the theology of Scripture and the justice of God.
89	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope needs to choose the role he wants to play.
90	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can act the cult leader catering to the emotional needs of his followers and the power lust of his institution.
91	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can take a responsible place in the world's religious community, embrace his "elder brothers" and give up the indulgence fantasies.
92	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He can't do both.

120	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)
124	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant operational implications for UNMIK," he said.
125	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Pending Security Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground in a manner consistent with the operational framework established under resolution 1244," he said.
126	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."
128	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region.
129	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	He concluded by saying that the UN's efforts in Kosovo are aimed at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo and the wider region remains stable, and that the safety and security of the population are preserved.

133	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton continued the battle to win the Democratic presidential nomination, with record turnouts in the North Carolina and Indiana primaries Tuesday.
134	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Voters lined up before sunrise in the capital of the midwestern state of Indiana, where the first polling stations opened at 6:00 am (1100 GMT) under overcast skies.
135	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The day's voting closes in North Carolina at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT), with a combined total of 187 pledged delegates on offer in the two states.
136	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Pre-election polls showed Obama leading in North Carolina while Clinton appeared to have the edge in Indiana.
137	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Judging by numbers, Obama is the Democratic front-runner so far, as he leads in pledged delegates and is also ahead in the popular vote.
138	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	However, he has also been unable to force Clinton out of the race.
139	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	If Obama can take both states, he will strengthen his advantage over Clinton and influence the superdelegates who will ultimately decide who will represent the Democratic Party in November's presidential election.
140	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Clinton needs to at least take Indiana to stay in the race.
142	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	A rolling average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com gives Obama 1,491 pledged delegates from all the races so far to Clinton's 1,337.
143	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Neither can reach the winning line of 2,025 without backing from the superdelegates -- party officials free to vote either way.
144	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	North Carolina and Indiana will also hold Republican presidential primaries Tuesday.
