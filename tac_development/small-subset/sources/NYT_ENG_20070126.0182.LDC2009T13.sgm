U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT

<P>
The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for
the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny
war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at
the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important
and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially
explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free
to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western
diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next
week. But they say the plan would also impose international
supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to
be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb
minority.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so
hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic
Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats
say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the
indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee
and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi
Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended
in 1999, would remain for the time being. The U.N. mission
governing the territory would be replaced by another
international organization that would have executive powers to
any annul legislation that breaches Kosovo's obligations under
U.N. agreements, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is
expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect
swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if
Serbia rejected such a move. But that step, diplomats caution, is
probably months away.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari handed his recommendations to representatives of the
United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia during
a meeting in Vienna, Austria. It will be presented to the Serbian
and Kosovo governments on Feb. 2. Even then, only the broad
outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and
experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap. Russia,
which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo as a province,
wants the Security Council vote delayed until Serbia has formed a
government, diplomats in Vienna say.
