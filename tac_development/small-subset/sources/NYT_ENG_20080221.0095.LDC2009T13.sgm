WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The pope could easily lose the respect
his office deserves by the divisive decisions he has recently
made. He offended the Jewish community directly and, indirectly,
insulted every thoughtful person.
</P>
<P>
Save that such actions are tragic for the church and the world,
they would be quickly dismissed in any rational consideration of
the church catholic.
</P>
<P>
Quite appropriately, Benedict XVI seeks the respect of the world
as leader of more than a billion Catholics. He behaves, however,
as if he were running an exclusive club with no need to consider
the sensibilities or intelligence of that world.
</P>
<P>
The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday
liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that
they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."
</P>
<P>
That is such an affront to the Jewish community that the
international assembly of Conservative Rabbis meeting this week
is considering a resolution to condemn the prayer for endangering
the mutual respect engendered in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The pope's revised prayer would undo much of the good will that
his predecessor, John Paul II, did for Jewish relations. John
Paul called Jews his "elder brothers" in the faith. Benedict
wants to convert them.
</P>
<P>
He seems intent to undo the remarkable work of the Second Vatican
Council in the 1960s to engage the contemporary world. He
declared a plenary indulgence for anyone who visits the French
shrine at Lourdes during its 150th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
That kind of spiritual abuse triggered the 16th-century
Protestant reformation. Luther objected to indulgences offered by
Pope Leo X in exchange for money to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica
in Rome. A plenary indulgence allows the faithful to bypass
purgatory, escape God's judgment and proceed directly to heaven.
</P>
<P>
Playing games with the souls of the faithful worked for a while
in the Middle Ages, but since Luther it has been seen for what it
is: A fund-raising marketing tool that mocks the mission of the
church, the theology of Scripture and the justice of God.
</P>
<P>
The pope needs to choose the role he wants to play. He can act
the cult leader catering to the emotional needs of his followers
and the power lust of his institution. He can take a responsible
place in the world's religious community, embrace his "elder
brothers" and give up the indulgence fantasies.
</P>
<P>
He can't do both.
