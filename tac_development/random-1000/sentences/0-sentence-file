1	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Ismael Khan, a top commander and governor of Herat province, was to meet Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar on Monday to discuss his formula for ending five months of fighting, his aide said.
2	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Ismael Khan had met with embattled President Burhanuddin Rabbani and a pro-Saudi Arabian leader, Rasul Sayyaf of the Ittehad-i-Islami faction, since arriving Thursday on a peace mission, the aide added.
3	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	He said Ismael Khan was seeking a negotiated settlement of the fighting between the forces of Rabbani and Hekmatyar which has raged since an aborted January 1 coup staged by the president's former communist ally, General Abdul Rashid Dostam.
4	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Rabbani has survived but the battle for Kabul has claimed more than 2,500 lives, while some 17,000 people have been wounded.
5	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	"If Ismael Khan's current efforts fail, Kabul will be plunged into a new and bitter round of fighting," warned his aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
6	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	The Herat governor was to meet Hekmatyar at his headquarters in the eastern district of Charasiab.
7	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	A close associate of Rabbani, Ismael Khan will impress upon Hekmatyar that his mission offered a last opportunity to end the fighting, the aide said.
8	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Ismael Khan has refused to talk with journalists but his aides said he planned to hold a press conference after completing his series of talks with feuding leaders.
9	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	He is also likely to meet Ali Mazari of the pro-Iranian Hezb-i-Wahdat, a group of Shiite Moslems who are indirectly siding with Hekmatyar.
10	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Sources in Ismael Khan's delegation, comprising officials from several western provinces, said the peace mission had taken on special importance following the recent apparent rejection of special UN envoy Mehmoud Mestiri's peace proposals.
11	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Unconfirmed reports said Mestiri was planning to propose the return of former king Zaher Shah from exile in Rome as an interim arrangement, but aides to Rabbani and Hekmatyar said they both rejected the idea.
12	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang Wenkang -- open on AIDS, less so on SARS -- set to lose job
13	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang, who is likely to lose his job over SARS, ironically hit the headlines in the past by representing a more open line on AIDS.
14	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang was removed Sunday as chief of the Communist Party branch for the Ministry of Health, state media said, in an indication that his days as minister may be numbered.
15	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	According to analysts, stripping an official of his party position is usually the prelude to sacking him from his government job.
16	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been put "under control".
17	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Since then, several reports have emerged of a systematic cover-up of the extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, involving especially military hospitals in the capital.
18	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's extensive background within military medicine.
19	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
20	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Until 1990 he served in various positions at the PLA's Second Medical University, before becoming deputy director of health at the PLA General Logistics Department until 1993.
21	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After a series of positions outside the PLA, Zhang was appointed health minister in 1998, as a member of what was considered a more capable and active Cabinet under then-premier Zhu Rongji.
22	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the spread of AIDS in China.
23	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.

25	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Monday said US forces fighting militia in Najaf were defeated by the "spiritual glory" of the Iraqi Shiite holy city.
26	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	He was quoted by state television as speaking on the occasion of the birthday of Ali, son-in-law of the prophet Mohammed and Shiite Islam's revered first Imam, who is buried in Najaf.
27	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	"This year's anniversary coincided with the ferocious and dastardly insult of the occupiers against the holy shrine of Imam Ali," Khamenei told a crowd of Islamist students.
28	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	"Despite their modern equipment, the occupiers failed before the spritual glory of this holy place and this is one of the amazing incidents of our time."
29	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	The battle in Najaf ended last week when Iraq's Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani brokered a peace deal as US and Iraqi government forces pounded the area around the Imam Ali shrine where rebel cleric Moqtada Sadr's Mehdi Army militia were holding out.
30	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	In a meeting with university lecturers and students, Khamenei urged young people to take Imam Ali, killed in Kufa in 661 AD by the rival Caliph, as an outstanding model for justice and spirituality.
31	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	Referring to Iran as a "source of hope for the world due to its confrontational position" towards the United States, Khamenei warned that "the world arrogance has targeted Iranian youth" in order to shut off the source.
32	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	"Today, we are in the middle of a cultural-political battlefield, a war of dual identity," the all-powerful leader noted.

34	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI called Monday for a peace accord in the Middle East, embroiled in a "conflict that has persisted for too long," during his New Year's Day mass at Saint Peter's Basilica.
35	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Marking World Peace Day, he referred to "the scene of the shepherds of Bethlehem visiting Jesus in the manger," asking: "How can you not look again at the dire situation that characterizes this land where Jesus was born?"
36	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	The 79-year-old pontiff asked: "How can you not implore with insistent prayer that the day of peace arrives as soon as possible to this region, the day when the conflict that has persisted for too long will be resolved?
37	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"A peace accord, to be durable, must rest on respect for dignity and the rights of each person," he urged the Vatican diplomatic corps attending the mass.
38	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"In the face of the threats to peace that are unfortunately ever- present, in the face of situations of injustice and violence that persist in many parts of the world, before continuing armed conflicts often forgotten by much of public opinion, and the danger of terrorism that disturbs peoples' serenity, it becomes more than ever necessary to work together for peace," he said.
39	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	On December 12 Benedict sent a message to the world's 1.1 billion Catholics ahead of World Peace Day in which he condemned what he called the transformation of religion "into an ideology," and said that "a war in the name of God is never acceptable."
40	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	The wide-ranging message also condemned violations of religious freedoms, inequality of the sexes, "disrespectful" attitudes towards the environment, religion transformed into "ideology", terrorism, human rights abuses and the spread of nuclear weapons.
41	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"The way to ensure a future of peace for everyone is found not only in international accords for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also in the determined commitment to seek their reduction and definitive dismantling," the pope said.

43	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Political leaders, diplomats, military personnel and hundreds of civilians gathered Thursday in St Peter's church in Riga to bid farewell to two young Latvian soldiers killed in Iraq last week.
44	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Latvian army privates Vitalijs Vasiljevs, 24, and Gints Bleija, 25, were killed by a roadside bomb near the central town of Al Diwaniyah on December 27, the first combat fatalities from the Baltic state since it sent soldiers to Iraq in 2003.
45	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"They were the best of soldiers," the chaplain of the Latvian armed forces, Elmars Plavins, said during the funeral service for the two soldiers.
46	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"God's mercy towards our troops has been immense so far," Plavins said, alluding to the fact that Latvian soldiers had suffered no casualties in Iraq since a soldier was killed in a demining operation in 2004.
47	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The two soldiers had carried out their duty "without grumbling or doubting", said Plavins.
48	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Among the dignitaries attending the ceremony, Latvian President Vaira Vike- Freiberga stopped and bowed silently in front of the two coffins, and laid a wreath alongside many others composed of maroon-red and white flowers, the colours of the Latvian flag.
49	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"The whole of Latvia is in mourning today," said Plavins.
50	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The sobs of grieving friends and family of the fallen filled the historic church as the caskets of the two soldiers were carried down the aisle by a guard of honour.
51	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"Our mission in Iraq will continue as long as necessary, but our duties there are changing," Defence Minister Atis Slakteris told AFP at the funeral service.
52	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The commander of the battalion the two soldiers belonged to said morale among Latvian troops who arrived in Iraq this week for a six-month tour of duty was high, in spite of the loss of their colleagues.
53	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"We can never get used to these tragedies," Major Ilmars Lejins told AFP at the church in Riga's Old Town.
54	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"Let us be grateful that three other soldiers survived the attack," he said, adding that the new deployment of soldiers was "ready to stand in for those who fell."
55	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Three other Latvian soldiers were wounded when an improvised explosive device (IED) went off as their Hummer vehicle drove past last week, killing Vasiljevs and Bleija.
56	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The vehicle was on its way back to the soldiers' base at Al Diwaniyah, southeast of Baghdad, the armed forces said in a statement.
57	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The young soldiers were killed shortly before their six-month tour of duty in Iraq was due to end.
58	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Vasiljevs was completing his second stint in Iraq.
59	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers in Latvia, which is a staunch ally of the United States, voted three weeks ago to extend the mission of the Baltic state's troops in Iraq by one more year.
60	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Latvia, which has a population of 2.3 million, currently has 124 soldiers in Iraq.

62	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	A criminal investigation is to be opened into Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's alleged abuse of influence while he was acting finance minister, Israel's Channel 10 reported Tuesday.
63	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	Attorney General Menahem Mazuz is expected to announce the probe into the allegations involving a bank privatisation in the coming days after Olmert returns from an official visit to China, the channel said.
64	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately possible to confirm the report with Mazuz.
65	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	Israeli police in October opened a "preliminary investigation" into Olmert's activities during the 2004 privatisation of Leumi Bank, Israel's second largest.
66	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	That followed a recommendation by State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss -- empowered by the Knesset, or national assembly, to review government policies and operations -- for Mazuz to open a criminal investigation into the affair.
67	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	The prime minister is suspected of intervening, while acting finance minister, on behalf of businessman Frank Lowy, who was attempting to secure an interest in the bank.
68	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	The bank was finally sold to another company with no relation to Lowry.
69	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	Olmert was involved in several corruption investigations last year, although no formal charges have been filed against him.

71	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	US lawmaker offers bill restoring military draft
72	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	A top Democratic lawmaker on Thursday reintroduced legislation to restore the US military draft, saying that the all-volunteer army is shorthanded and overwhelmed by current and future troop deployments in Iraq.
73	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	Representative Charles Rangel said a draft would spread out the human cost of the four-year-long Iraq operation, which he has said has been borne disproportionately by lower- and middle-class Americans.
74	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	The New York lawmaker said the burden was likely to be even greater if US President George W. Bush makes good on his plan to increase US troops in Iraq by more than 20,000, as part of his plan to subdue the raging insurgency there.
75	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"If Americans are to be placed in harm's way, all of us, from every income group and position in society, must share the burden of war," Rangel said.
76	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of our troops fighting in Iraq are young men and women who have chosen to enlist because military service is an economic opportunity," Rangel said.
77	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"They are motivated by enlistment bonuses up to 40,000 dollars and additional thousands in scholarships to attend college.
78	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	They are from urban and rural communities where there is high unemployment and few opportunities to pursue the American Dream," said Rangel.
79	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"It is time that all Americans -- including the wealthy -- be given the opportunity to prove their patriotism as well, by saluting when the flag goes up and defending their country in wartime.
80	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	A military draft would ensure that."
81	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	Rangel first proposed legislation for the draft in January 2003 before the invasion of Iraq two months later, but it was voted down.
82	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	He again failed to win support when he reintroduced the bill last year.
83	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	The United States has heavily depended on military reserves to keep up staffing levels in Iraq, where more than 3,000 US soldiers have died, and many soldiers have been pushed into multiple tours because of the shortage of fresh troops.
84	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Condemnation of Bush Iraq plan mirrors failure to follow Baker ideas by David Millikin
85	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Defying expectations, the new Iraq strategy unveiled by President George W. Bush this week mirrored many proposals from the heavyweight Iraq Study Group led by former secretary of state James Baker.
86	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	But Bush's refusal to incorporate two of the panel's central recommendations -- set a target date for beginning to withdraw US forces from Iraq and seek Iran's and Syria's help to stabilize the country -- was enough to earn the plan a searing thumbs down from the president's critics.
87	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
88	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The decision to deepen US involvement in the unpopular war while foregoing diplomacy drew scathing criticism not only from opposition Democrats but also from some leaders of Bush's Republican party.
89	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"I believe it's a tragic mistake," said Senator Joseph Biden, a 2008 Democratic presidential hopeful and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appeared before the panel Thursday to defend the Bush plan.
90	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
91	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	In stark contrast, the congressionally mandated Iraq Study Group, co-chaired by Baker, a Republican who served with Bush's father when he was president, and Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton, won wide praise for the proposals it submitted in early December.
92	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The report focussed on shifting responsibility for ending the spiralling sectarian violence in Iraq from US to Iraqi forces so American troops could begin withdrawing by early next year.
93	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and radicalization across the region.
94	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.
95	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"From where I sit, Madam Secretary, you are not listening to the American people, you are not listening to the military ... you are not listening to the Iraq Study Group," Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer fumed at Rice Thursdsay.
96	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The strategy released by Bush however reflected key elements of the Baker outline, including a need to boost training of Iraqi forces by "embedding" more US advisors and making US support conditional on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government meeting "benchmarks" for achieving security and political reconciliation.
97	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.
98	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice met another of the group's main recommendations Thursday when she named a "czar" to oversee a new, more decentralised push for economic reconstruction and job creation in Iraq.
99	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	She is also due to leave Friday for a tour of the Middle East that will include talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on their moribund peace process and efforts to rally moderate Arab allies to Iraq's aid.
100	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	But at the same time, Bush's top diplomat made clear that diplomacy involving Syria and Iran remained out of the question.
101	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over neighboring Lebanon.
102	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"That's not diplomacy, that's extortion," she said.
103	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	A former State Department official who was instrumental in the work of the Iraq Study Group downplayed the differences with Bush's final plan and suggested the Democrats who now control Congress could still force the president's hand on the missing elements.
104	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Its not a repudiation -- there are a lot of things in the plan that come directly from the Iraq Study Group," said the former diplomat, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the group.
105	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"On the two really critical points they did not adopt -- a target date to begin drawing down US troops and talks with Syria and Iran -- those are points that many people in Congress will press, so they're not dead," he said.

107	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Two Palestinian civilians were wounded by Israeli fire on Tuesday in the northern Gaza Strip, near the border with Israel, medics and witnesses said.
108	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The army fired a rocket from just inside Israel and a drone fired a second one into the Jabaliya area, from where Palestinian militants had launched a home- made projectile at the Jewish state, witnesses said.
109	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The Israeli army, which was not immediately available to comment on the incident, said two rockets were fired into Israel by militants in Gaza early Tuesday, landing without causing injuries or damage.
110	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The incidents were the latest violations of a November 26 ceasefire, under which the Israeli army withdrew its troops from Gaza while Palestinian militants were to stop firing rockets into Israel.
111	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Since then militants have fired more than 90 rockets at Israel, with 76 of them falling inside the Jewish state.
112	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	At least three Palestinians have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire in the coastal strip.
113	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Responding to the latest attack on Israel, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat insisted on the need to respect the ceasefire so as to avoid Israeli reprisals.
114	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	"The ceasefire with Israel is very important because, if Israel resumes assassinations and arrests it will destroy any chance of relaunching the peace process.
115	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Consequently, the ceasefire should be preserved, because that serves Palestinian interests."

118	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	The USS John C. Stennis, with four accompanying ships, will soon join the US Navy forces based in Bahrain, which includes aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, said Commander Kevin Aandahl of the Fifth Fleet.
119	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	"It could be weeks, it could be more or... less," he said, refusing to give a more precise date of arrival.
120	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	It is scheduled to sail Tuesday from its home port of Bremerton, Washington, he said.
121	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	Stennis will have around 5,000 sailors, as well as around 80 fixed wing aircraft, including F/A-18 Hornet and Superhornet fighter-bombers, he added.
122	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush earlier this month ordered a second US aircraft carrier battle group to the Gulf and announced the deployment of a Patriot missile defense battalion to the region to protect allies against potential missile strikes.
123	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	Bush vowed at the time that US forces would "seek out and destroy" any networks funneling weapons or fighters from Syria or Iran into Iraq.
124	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	A senior US military official added that the United States planned to keep two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Gulf for months -- the first such deployment since the first year of the Iraq war.
125	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	Asked whether the buildup was aimed at Iran and signaled a more confrontational stance with its Islamic regime, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday the United States was simply reaffirming the strategic importance of the Gulf region.
126	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	The US Central Command said last week that the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower was dispatched to operate off the coast of Somalia as US gunships pounded Al- Qaeda hideouts in the war-torn country.

128	AFP_ENG_20070125.0424.LDC2009T13	One person was killed and about 20 more injured in clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim demonstrators in Beirut on Thursday, hospital sources said.
129	AFP_ENG_20070125.0424.LDC2009T13	The fighting erupted at a Beirut university as students from rival political factions wielded clubs and threw rocks at each other and the violence later spread to several other parts of the Lebanese capital.

131	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	A high-ranking US Treasury official is due to arrive in Beijing Sunday for talks with North Korean envoys on US financial sanctions which Pyongyang says stand in the way of an agreement on halting its nuclear arms program, an embassy spokesperson said.
132	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Daniel Glaser, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, will hold talks with North Korean officials in the Chinese capital Tuesday, the spokesperson told AFP.
133	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Talks last occurred between the two parties in December in Beijing, but ended in diplomatic deadlock.
134	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Analysts say a resolution of the financial sanctions is critical to ending the broader problem of Pyongyang's nuclear drive, under discussion in parallel talks involving the United States, Russia, China, Japan and the two Koreas.
135	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	After long negotiations, North Korea agreed in a September 2005 pact to dismantle its nuclear program in return for diplomatic recognition and food and energy aid.
136	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	But the pact was never implemented because of Pyongyang's protests over financial sanctions Washington imposed on Macau- based Banco Delta Asia the same month.
137	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	The United States claimed the bank served as key conduit for North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering.
138	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Pyongyang has denied Washington's allegations.
139	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Talks on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program attained new urgency in October when it tested an atomic bomb for the first time.

141	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia on Monday announced that Adel al-Jubeir, an advisor to King Abdullah, has been named as its new ambassador to the United States, the oil- rich kingdom's top diplomatic posting.
142	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Jubeir, also a former spokesman at the embassy in Washington, replaces Prince Turki al-Faisal who resigned abruptly in December for what he said were family reasons.
143	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The appointment was announced by royal decree on Monday.
144	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	"In accordance with a request from Prince Turki al-Faisal bin Abdul Aziz... to be discharged from his duties and in accordance with a proposal from the foreign minister, we have ordered the nomination of Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir as ambassador to the United States with the rank of minister," said the decree, reported by the official news agency SPA.
145	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The Washington Post had said last year that Prince Turki had been increasingly rumoured as a possible replacement for his brother, Foreign Minister Saud al- Faisal, who it said was in fragile health.
146	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	When Prince Turki flew home after only 15 months in the crucial diplomatic post, a source at the Saudi embassy said he had left after telling staff he was quitting because he wanted to spend more time with his family.
147	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is regarded as a close regional ally of the United States, although differences have emerged over Washington's policy in violence-wracked Iraq.
148	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Prince Turki made a series of speeches last year urging Washington not to withdraw its troops from Iraq precipitously, and repeatedly urged the White House to try to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
149	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Before taking up the Washington job in 2005, he spent nearly three years as ambassador in Britain.
150	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	He also spent 25 years as the head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence service.
151	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	In the 1980s, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Prince Turki worked closely with Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in organising Muslim volunteers to join the Afghan insurgency.
152	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	In a November 2001 interview with the Saudi MBC television channel, he confirmed meeting bin Laden several times in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan before 1994.
153	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Prince Turki was named in a civil suit in the US courts by the families of victims seeking damages over his alleged role in financing bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network.
154	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit was dismissed in 2003.

156	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Billions of people will suffer water shortages and the number of hungry will grow by hundreds of millions by 2080 as global temperatures rise, scientists warn in a report leaked Tuesday.
157	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report estimates that between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion people will be suffering from water scarcity problems by 2080 and between 200 million and 600 million more people will be going hungry.
158	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The assessment is contained in a draft of a major international report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to be released later this year, Australia's The Age newspaper said.
159	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Rising sea levels could flood seven million more homes, while Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef, treasured as the world's largest living organism, could be dead within decades, the scientists warn, the newspaper said.
160	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The Age said it had obtained a copy of the report, believed to be one of three prepared for release by the IPCC, which is highly regarded for its neutrality and caution.
161	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Some 500 experts are meeting in Paris this week ahead of the release on Friday of the IPCC's first report since 2001 on the state of scientific knowledge on global warming.
162	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report will be followed in April by volumes focusing on the impacts of climate change and on the social-economic costs of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
163	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	A chapter on Australia in the report on global impacts warns that coral bleaching in the Barrier Reef is likely to become an annual occurrence by as early as 2030 due to warmer, more acidic seas.
164	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Bleaching occurs when the plant-like organisms that make up coral die and leave behind the white limestone skeleton of the reef.
165	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The World Heritage site, stretching over more than 345,000 square kilometers (133,000 sq miles) off Australia's northeast coast, will become "functionally extinct", the scientists are quoted as saying.
166	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Average global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 to 0.8 degrees since 1900, which the report says contributed to increased bleaching in coral reefs in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
167	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	At 2.0 to 3.0 degrees above 1900 levels, the report predicts the "complete loss" of Australia's alpine zones and the possible collapse of South America's Amazon forest system, causing a "huge loss of biodiversity".
168	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The human and economic costs of climate change are likely to be highest in poor countries, with water shortages crippling many African nations and increased coastal flooding hitting low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and many Pacific islands, the report says.

176	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	The combined entity will have annual output of around 25 million tonnes and more than 87,000 employees.

178	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	"This acquisition is not about job cuts," Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said, adding in the same breath that no one in the world can really consider his job secure.

185	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	"However, what we are not prepared to accept is the accelerated or slow demise of the UK steel industry.
186	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	"Tata should be under no illusions that we will resist any attempt to achieve this, using all the resources at our disposal."
187	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	The union put Tata on notice amid concerns of possible job cuts following the takeover, the biggest acquisition by an Indian company.
188	AFP_ENG_20070202.0012.LDC2009T13	Tata Steel shares tumbled about 13 percent in the past two days on concern Tata is paying too high a price.

212	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	A Swedish nuclear reactor was shut down on Saturday after a fault was found in rubber pannels in the reactor's housing, the plant's operators said.
213	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Forsmark 1 was shut down after a sample taken from one of three rubber pannels in the reactor's outer housing was found to have lost its required elasticity, spokesman for Forsmark's operator FKA, Claes-Inge Andersson, told AFP.
214	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	"The rubber had become stiff ... it needs to be elastic," Andersson said.
215	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Further tests were to be carried out on the reactor on Sweden's east coast.
216	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Later on Saturday initial tests on Forsmark 1's sister reactor, Forsmark 2, also led to its shutdown for similar analysis.
217	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	"We will do the same work on Forsmark 2 as we are doing on Forsmark 1," Andersson said.
218	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	It was not known when either of the reactors would resume power production, he added.
219	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The twin shutdowns follow the emergence earlier in the week of a damning internal report into safety standards at Forsmark, made public six months after a serious incident at the plant.
220	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The report blamed lax security on a series of "potentially fatal accidents", including a nitrogen gas leak, employees handling live electrical wires, falls in the workplace and employees sent home for failing sobriety tests.
221	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	An electricity failure at the facility on July 25, 2006, led to the immediate shutdown of Forsmark 1 after two of four backup generators, which supply power to the reactor's cooling system, malfunctioned for about 20 minutes.
222	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Some experts have suggested that a catastrophic reactor meltdown was narrowly avoided.
223	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The incident prompted authorities to temporarily shut down five of Sweden's 10 reactors for security checks and maintenance.
224	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Some of the reactors remained shut down for several months.
225	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate has asked prosecutors to investigate whether FKA broke the law in its response to the malfunction at Forsmark.
226	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	On Friday a prosecutor announced the launch of a preliminary investigation into FKA's handling of the incident.
227	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Nuclear power accounts for nearly half of Sweden's electricity production.
228	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The country has shut two of its 12 nuclear reactors since 1999 as part of a plan to phase out nuclear power over the next 30 or so years, or when the reactors' lifespan expires.

241	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	In 2006, there were 3.2 million new cases of cancer in 39 European countries, compared with 2.9 million in 2004, they said.
242	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	For the first time, breast cancer overtook lung cancer as the commonest diagnosed cancer, with 429,000 new cases in 2006, or nearly one in seven of the total.
243	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	It was followed by colorectal cancer, with 412,900 cases, and lung cancer, 386,300 cases.
244	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Lung cancer, though, remains the biggest killer, accounting for 334,800 out of the 1.7 million cancer deaths in Europe in 2006.
245	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	It was followed by colorectal cancer (207,400 deaths), breast cancer (131,900) and stomach cancer (118,200).
246	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	The report was issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), based in Lyon, southeastern France.
247	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco smoking," said IARC director Peter Boyle.
248	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"Tobacco control is clearly a number one priority in Europe, not only aimed at men, particularly the male populations of Central and Eastern Europe, but increasingly targeted towards women, especially in Northern Europe."
249	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	EU to propose deep cuts in new car emissions
250	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for cleaner air.
251	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	After struggling to reach a compromise, a consensus has emerged in the European Union's executive arm for a proposal to require new cars' average carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced to 120 grammes per kilometre by 2012.
252	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	New passenger cars currently emit about 160 grammes of CO2 per kilometre.
253	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Under the proposal, auto makers would be required to limit average emissions across their fleet to 130 grammes per kilometer by improving the technology they use.
254	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	A further 10 grammes would be cut through requirements on tyre, equipment and fuel makers to improve air-conditioning efficiency, tyre pressure monitoring and gear shift indicators while increasing the use of biofuels and other measures.
255	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	With car makers failing to meet existing voluntary targets, the commission was in agreement that binding limits were needed, but Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen were divided over how much an effort should come from car makers.
256	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Dimas sought a tough binding limit of 120 grammes for car makers while Verheugen wanted measures to be shared with tyre, equipment and fuel makers, easing the burden on the automobile industry, which he says employs 12 million people directly or indirectly in Europe.
257	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The compromise proposal is to be officially presented after its adoption by other commissioners.
258	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission is aiming to present by the end of the year formal legislation that will then have to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.
259	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European car industry is up in arms about the proposals, which it says could force them to relocate production elsewhere.
260	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European car industry association said in a statement.
261	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"It will lead to a loss of jobs and a relocation of production outside Europe," it added.
262	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	European, Japanese and Korean manufacturers have failed to meet a voluntary target to cut average emissions for new cars sold in Europe by 25 percent from 1995 levels.
263	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission says they have so far only decreased emissions by 12.4 percent, which the EU executive describes as "not satisfactory."
264	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Road transport pollution has risen 30 percent since 1990 and now makes up more than a quarter of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions, with half of that from passenger cars.
265	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission's hesitation to bring forward plans on car emissions cast a shadow over a recent drive to fight climate change, which was one of the main planks of a wide-ranging energy action plan it unveiled last month.
266	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Just a month ago, the EU unveiled its new energy strategy to great fanfare, with claims that the EU was going to play a real global leadership role -- and yet here we see it falling at the first hurdle, failing at the first test," said Green euro-deputy Caroline Lucas.
267	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Facts about the NATO-led security force in Afghanistan
268	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, topping the agenda of a meeting of alliance defence ministers Thursday, now comprises almost 35,500 troops.
269	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to official figures released Wednesday.
270	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had rotated among different nations every six months.
271	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO expanded its operations from Kabul and the relatively quiet north and west of the conflict-torn country, to the south and east, where a resurgent Taliban militia has opposed it.
272	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The Taliban, ousted from power in late 2001 for harbouring Osama bin Laden, is expected to mount a new offensive in the south and east in coming weeks as the weather warms.
273	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Its fighters seized control of one town last week.
274	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Britain, along with Canada -- with 2,500 troops -- and the Netherlands, 2,200, have born the brunt of the fighting in the Taliban's heartland in the south, and NATO commanders have urged the allies to inject more resources.
275	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	On the eve of the NATO meeting in Seville, Germany announced plans to deploy six reconnaissance jets -- and the 500 personnel needed to run them -- but it insists they will play no combat role.
276	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Britain also announced that it would have an additional 800 troops in the south of the country by the Afghan summer.
277	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Poland has started deploying around 1,000 troops, which are likely to be in place by April.
278	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO's new military chief, US General Bantz Craddock, is likely to urge the 26 alliance nations to come up with an additional three battalions, whose size differs from country to country but should mean about 3,000 personnel.
279	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Officials say, though, that no new offers are likely to be made in Seville.
280	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The ISAF operation -- NATO's most ambitious mission ever -- is aimed at spreading the influence of President Hamid Karzai's weak central government to the more lawless outlying regions.
281	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The way it plays out could determine the future of the 60-year- old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations, or more modestly just peacekeeping and reconstruction.
282	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	ISAF troop numbers fluctuate constantly as troops are deployed, rotated, replaced or simply withdrawn from the country.
283	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Iranian nuclear negotiator to meet UN atomic agency chief by Michael Adler
284	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani is to meet in Vienna Friday with the chief of the UN watchdog, Mohamed ElBaradei, an agency spokesman said.
285	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Larijani is on his way to Munich for an international security conference at which European countries will seek a breakthrough in the crisis over Iran's nuclear programme, diplomats have told AFP.
286	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The spokesman said "this is the sort of meeting that occurs regularly," as Larijani often consults with ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's compliance with with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
287	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	ElBaradei proposed in January a "time-out" in the confrontation over Iran's nuclear ambitions.
288	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Iran rejects a UN Security Council resolution of December 23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium.
289	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	ElBaradei has proposed that in simultaneous moves Iran should suspend enrichment and the United Nations should hold off on sanctions.
290	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	A diplomat close to the IAEA said European states would be seeking in Munich to use informal contacts with Larijani to get Iran "to come up with some realistic, achievable proposals" to meet the UN demands.
291	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The uranium enrichment uses centrifuges to make fuel for civilian nuclear reactors but can also be used to make material for bombs.
292	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	It is at the heart of US charges that Iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons.
293	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Tehran insists its programme is peaceful.
294	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	A second diplomat said the best outcome, on the sidelines of the Conference on Security Policy being held in the southern German city from Friday to Sunday, would be for European Union powers Britain, Germany and France, along with Russia and China to hold a meeting with Iran.
295	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	"They might agree on some sort of framework or concept under which the Iranians will pull the plug on centrifuges for a couple of months" -- opening the door to wider talks including the United States -- and for the Security Council to take "no action for that period" on sanctions.
296	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Moscow supports ElBaradei's "time-out" proposal.
297	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	But diplomacy in Munich could be stilled by the long shadow of the United States, and perhaps hardline allies like Britain, which reject such simultaneity and want any Iranian enrichment pause to come first and be unconditional in order to keep Iran from winning additional time to continue strategic fuel work.
298	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	US officials have pointed out that once Iran met its commitments to stop such fuel work, the Security Council would suspend its sanctions, as the resolution makes clear.
299	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	But diplomats said some European states were at least playing with the idea of a face-saving solution along the lines of a "time-out" that fudges the need for Iran to unconditionally stand-down.
300	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The Security Council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by ElBaradei later this month shows Tehran continuing to defy the Security Council, especially since Iran is pressing ahead with building an underground plant at Natanz for industrial-level uranium enrichment.
301	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The Munich meeting gathers international leaders in a framework that favours informal contacts.
302	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, new US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who led the EU's stalled talks with Iran, will all be at the conference.
303	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Non-proliferation analyst Mark Fitzpatrick, of the London think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: "Iran will be looking for a way to escape further sanctions" but he said that what Larijani "has to offer will likely fall short of the Security Council's resolution for a verified suspension."

305	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	Czech historians are to pore over communist-era secret police files kept on the country's priests to establish the level of collaboration by the Church, the Czech theology academy said on Friday.
306	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	"To open up a process of reflection, first and foremost one has to have an objective point of view on what is hidden in the archives of the StB (the secret police)," Stanislav Novotny, head of the academy, told AFP.
307	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	The announcement followed an agreement between the academy and the interior ministry to allow access to the files, and a call for a national enquiry earlier this month from the archbishop of Prague, Miloslav Vlk.
308	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	Cardinal Vlk has said that he has a list of around 40 priests who admitted privately to him in years immediately following the fall of communism in 1989 that they were collaborators.
309	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	Dark secrets about the role of the Church in communist-era central and eastern Europe have come in the spotlight in recent months, most notably in Slovakia -- which together with the Czech Republic made up the former Czechoslovakia -- and in Poland.
310	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	In Poland, the newly installed archbishop of Warsaw, Stanislaw Wielgus, was forced into a dramatic resignation last month after revelations that he had collaborated with the communist-era secret police.
311	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Cycling: Landis blasts USADA over sample re-test bid
312	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Embattled 2006 Tour de France champion Floyd Landis blasted the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on Friday regarding attempts to re- test cleared doping samples from last year's race.
313	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis tested positive for testosterone after winning stage 17 of the cycling classic last July but has challenged the handling of the sample and testing conditions at the French laboatory which processed the dope test.
314	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Landis said he was responding to a report in the French sports newspaper l'Equipe regarding attempts by USADA to re-test samples from the race plus two subsequent out-of- competition samples given last August.
315	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at a request last December from USADA attorney Travis Tygart for more tests on "B" portions of cleared "A" samples from Labaratoire National Depistage de Dopage's (LNDD) laboratory at Chatenay-Malabry.
316	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at the notion of retesting samples he considers tainted at the very center whose procedures he is challenging in an appeal of his doping positive to USADA.
317	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	That hearing is set for May 14.
318	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"They got it wrong the first time and they're trying to get it wrong again," Landis said in the statement.
319	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I am very concerned regarding the LNDD's handling of my samples over the last six months as well as the Anti-Doping Agencies' complete and consistent disregard of their own rules and procedures.
320	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"With the steady stream of news flow regarding serious problems at the LNDD, it's impossible to understand USADA's motivation for this move unless it's simply another way to drain my resources in this fight to clear my name.
321	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"My message to USADA and the LNDD is this testing should have been done right the first time."
322	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis argues his stage 17 positive came from a contaminated sample that LNDD continued to process in violation of World Anti- Doping Agency protocols.
323	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I have not taken testosterone or any other performance enhancing substance," Landis said.
324	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis has agreed not to race in France this season, giving him no chance to defend the crown that could be stripped from him if the positive dope test stands.
325	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I'm 100 percent confident that if best practice in process and technology were applied to testing my sample back in July, I would be racing my bike this season," Landis said.
326	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	While critics could argue that if Landis had nothing to hide, he has no reason to object to more testing of samples that were clear, Landis argues the re-test move would violate WADA and International Cycling Union rules.
327	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's request for further analysis of "B" samples is in clear violation the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code and Union Cyclist International (UCI) rules and is unprecedented in athlete anti-doping cases," the statement said.
328	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's illegal initiative would also cause the Landis team to expend unnecessary resources to halt a clearly prohibited activity - resources that have already been unduly and unfairly stretched by the ADA's unethical approach to their pursuit of unsubstantiated allegations against Landis."
329	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis' legal team claims to have been denied full access to details of his results "and has no reason to believe that it would be provided with the results of any further tests", the statement said.
330	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis attorney Maurice Suh expects it would not receive documentation from any proposed re-testing.
331	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"Illegal re-testing of these cleared samples is designed to further injure Floyd by costing him and his team substantial time and money, more deeply invading his privacy and destroying evidence that may later on be valuable in his defense," Suh said.
332	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA continues to dramatically demonstrate that they have no interest in providing Floyd with a fair and just outcome to this process."

334	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Elie Wiesel, the renowned Holocaust author and Nobel Peace Prize winner, was attacked and dragged out of a San Francisco hotel elevator last week, The San Francisco Chronicle reported on its website Friday.
335	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Citing police officials, the newspaper said Wiesel was possibly assaulted by a Holocaust denier who claims to have stalked him for weeks.
336	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Wiesel, 78, was at the Argent Hotel on February 1 for an interfaith conference when he was confronted around 6:30 pm in an elevator by a man insisting that he wanted to interview the author, the report said.
337	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Wiesel said he would do the interview in the lobby of the Third Street hotel, but the man insisted on going to Wiesel's room, said the paper.
338	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	The man then stopped the elevator at the sixth floor, dragged Wiesel out and tried to force him into a room on that floor, The Chronicle reported.
339	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	"That's when (Wiesel) started yelling," the paper quotes police Sergeant Neville Gittens as saying.
340	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	The man fled, and Wiesel, who was not injured, went down to the lobby and called police.
341	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Wiesel decided to leave the conference on "Facing Violence: Justice, Religion and Conflict Resolution," and police escorted him to the airport, the paper said.
342	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, a man identifying himself Eric Hunt and claiming to be the attacker posted an account of the incident on a virulently anti-Semitic and anti-Israel website, The Chronicle said.
343	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	The account matches the description of the attack that police later released, according to the newspaper.

345	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The US Congress on Tuesday holds its first major debate on the Iraq war since it authorized President George W. Bush to invade the country in 2002.
346	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Opposition Democrats in the House of Representatives are to debate a symbolic measure introduced Monday that calls for supporting US troops and criticizes the president's decision to send 21,500 extra US troops Iraq.
347	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Legislators with Bush's Republican party blocked a similar, more complicated measure in the Senate last week on procedural grounds.
348	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Democrats won control of Congress in November elections thanks to voter anger over the nearly four-year-old war, in which more than 3,100 American soldiers have died.
349	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	About 138,000 US soldiers are currently in Iraq.
350	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Democratic House majority leader Steny Hoyer is the first legislator scheduled to speak.
351	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	"We believe the American public want a straightforward answer to the question: Do you agree with the president's proposal?"
352	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Hoyer told NBC television on Sunday.
353	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The last major debate in Congress on Iraq was in October 2002, when a bipartisan majority in both chambers authorized Bush to use military force if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein failed to comply with United Nations resolutions on disarmament and let in weapons inspectors.
354	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Some legislators who are now prominent war critics, including Senators Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, expressed misgivings but still voted for the authorization.
355	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The non-binding House measure says in less than 100 words that "Congress disapproves" of Bush's so-called troop surge, and expresses continued support for the military -- an apparent attempt to avoid appearing unpatriotic and lure undecided Republicans.
356	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The White House indicated that Bush would not be swayed by any resolution against his Iraq policy, and warned that such a measure would send the wrong message to US troops and America's enemies.
357	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Republicans last week blocked a 1,600-word bipartisan Senate resolution opposing the new Iraq policy, the first major setback for majority Democrats.
358	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The breakdown in the narrowly-divided Senate is 51 Democrats to 49 Republicans, meaning bills require a greater degree of bipartisan support to pass.
359	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Democrats hold a more comfortable 233 to 202 majority over Republicans in the 435-member House.
360	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The president announced the troop increase on January 10, six days after Democrats took control of Congress.
361	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	A sizeable majority of Americans now oppose the war and less than half have voiced confidence in Bush's new plan to deploy more troops in an effort to restore security to Baghdad amid escalating sectarian violence.
362	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	House leaders have allowed each member five minutes to comment on the measure.
363	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	A vote is expected by Friday.

365	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming sentiment of the military is it won't work, and certainly the American people do not believe it'll work."
366	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The House Republican minority leader, John Boehner, said he opposed the resolution but feared that some Republicans would vote for it.

368	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Police on Tuesday identified an 18-year-old Bosnian immigrant as the gunman who killed five people in a Utah shopping mall before he was shot dead by police.
369	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank said detectives were still struggling to find a motive behind Solejman Talovic's bloody assault on the historic Trolley Square complex on Monday.
370	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Talovic, whose family arrived in the United States about three or four years ago, was killed after being cornered by an off-duty police officer celebrating Valentine's Day early with his wife when the teenager's killing spree began.
371	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Burbank said Talovic had been armed with a shotgun and a pistol and was carrying several rounds of ammunition in a backpack and a waistband.
372	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"This individual had one thing in mind.
373	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	He was well prepared, he had a backpack with numerous rounds of ammunition as well as an additional firearm," Burbank said.
374	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"He had one purpose."
375	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Burbank said the quick thinking of off-duty police officer Ken Hammond from Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had cut short Talovic's rampage, saving "numerous" lives.
376	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Hammond had been having a Valentine's dinner with his wife and left the restaurant where they were eating after hearing gunfire.
377	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"The officer contained him until other officers arrived and resolved the situation," Burbank said.
378	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"There's no question his quick actions saved the lives of numerous other people."
379	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Hammond played down descriptions of himself as a hero.
380	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"I was just the one that was there," he told a news conference.
381	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	No further details on Talovic were immediately available.
382	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian community in Salt Lake City is reported to number around 3,000 people.
383	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Burbank said the condition of four people injured in the shooting had improved early Tuesday.
384	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Police said a 52-year-old man, two 28-year-old women, a 24-year- old man and a 15 -year-old girl were killed in the attack, which took place at around 6:45 pm Monday.
385	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Witnesses reported Talovic coolly moving through the 80-shop mall, gunning down his victims.
386	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"He was totally calm and didn't seem to be upset or mad or anything.
387	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	He was just completely tranquil.
388	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	It was so bizarre," said Marie Smith, the manager of a toiletries store.
389	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in the northeastern US city of Philadelphia on Monday, a lone gunman entered an office complex and opened fire, leaving four people dead, including the attacker.
390	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	A fifth person was seriously wounded.
391	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	The Philadelphia incident, arising from an apparent business dispute, happened at about 8:30 pm local time in an office complex at the city's old naval base, local media reported.
392	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	The gunman opened fire on at least four people before turning the gun on himself.
393	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Police told the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper that the shooting took place after a dispute during a company board meeting.
394	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"It appeared that the shooter was upset over something that was going on inside the business," Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross told the Inquirer.

396	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Indonesia is failing to protect millions of domestic workers, some as young as 12, who face long hours, potentially deadly beatings and sexual abuse, Amnesty International said in a report released Wednesday.
397	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The estimated 2.6 million domestic workers in Indonesia are generally considered second-class citizens, the London-based rights watchdog said.
398	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Too many women domestic workers in Indonesia ... face human rights abuses at work," said the report entitled Exploitation and abuse: the plight of women domestic workers.
399	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Often forced to work from as young as 12 years of age, they suffer economic exploitation and poor working conditions, as well as gender-based discrimination.
400	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Many are subjected to physical, psychological and sexual violence.
401	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some are even killed."
402	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The report details cases of women and girls who were abused, raped and even beaten to death by their employers.
403	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty said their plight often remained hidden, as they were ashamed of talking about their experiences, and the authorities and general public appeared oblivious to them.
404	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"By contrast, the plight of Indonesian domestic workers in other parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East often makes headlines in Indonesia," it said.
405	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some 640,000 Indonesians work abroad, mostly as maids, with Malaysia one of the top destinations.
406	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"We often think of domestic workers as people travelling out of Indonesia to other countries, but there is a large population of Indonesian domestic workers in their own country, who are not recognised by law," Amnesty International Malaysia executive director Josef Roy Benedict told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
407	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"This means they are not able to form trade unions or get any help legally."
408	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Government moves to address the problem were falling short, the report said, "leaving millions of women vulnerable to abusive employers."
409	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	While the government had submitted a draft law on domestic workers, it omitted basic rights given to other workers such as limits on working hours and a minimum wage, and most people were also unaware that a law on domestic violence applied to maids, Amnesty said.
410	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Like every other human being, domestic workers have rights -- including the right to be free from violence, the right to rest and the right to be paid an adequate wage.
411	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The government is currently failing to protect these rights," Amnesty deputy Asia director Natalie Hill said.
412	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty called on the government to ensure maids received the same protection as other workers.
413	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"The government needs to stop viewing domestic workers as inferior and give them the same legal protections as other workers.
414	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	It also needs to educate police, the courts, employers and recruitment agencies on the fact that violence against domestic workers is a criminal offence," Hill said.

416	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	Newcastle striker Obafemi Martins on Tuesday apologised for refusing to play for Nigeria in last week's friendly against Ghana.
417	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	Martins, who missed the 4-1 defeat to tend to his sick mother, told BBC Sport: "I apologise to the Nigeria Football Association (NFA) and the players because it was a very important game.
418	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	But I also believe my mum was more important."
419	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	The NFA were angered by the player's absence, describing him as unpatriotic and referred the case to their disciplinary committee.
420	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	Martins says despite this row he will be available to play for his country in the future.
421	AFP_ENG_20070214.0337.LDC2009T13	"When I am called upon I will play for them, because you have to respect the national team.

424	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Australia announced Thursday that it had agreed to host a new US military communications base, calling it a practical expression of the strong alliance between the two countries.
425	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	The base would serve as a ground station for communications with American military forces throughout the world, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told parliament.
426	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Australia already hosts a major satellite communications base at Pine Gap outside Alice Springs, which is jointly manned with the United States.
427	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	"These facilities are fundamental in underpinning and giving practical effect to the US alliance, and the government is strongly committed to the alliance as the key guarantee to our nation's security," Downer said.
428	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Details of the agreement on the new base, at Kojarena near Geraldton in Western Australia, were expected to be finalised within months, Defence Minister Brendan Nelson said.
429	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	The announcement comes at a time when Australia's alliance with the United States and its involvement in the Iraq war are subjects of heated debate.
430	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister John Howard has been accused by the opposition Labor Party of jeopardising relations by interfering in US domestic politics as the race to succeed President George W. Bush, a Republican, gets under way.
431	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Howard, a close Bush ally, drew fire in the United States and at home for suggesting that terrorists would pray for a Democratic victory after presidential hopeful Barack Obama proposed withdrawing troops from Iraq.
432	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	The opposition has also pressured Howard to announce a withdrawal plan for Iraq, where Australia has some 1,400 soldiers with the US-led coalition.
433	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Howard has refused, saying that Labor's plan to pull the troops out if it wins this year's elections is the biggest threat to the alliance with the US.

435	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Rangers boss Walter Smith on Friday welcomed a UEFA decision to take no action against Barry Ferguson over an altercation with a Hapoel Tel Aviv player in the club's UEFA Cup defeat in Israel this week.
436	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Gers captain Ferguson appeared to strike Hapoel's Tal Chen after being floored by Luciano De Bruno during the 2-1 first leg defeat on Wednesday, and afterwards Hapoel's coach Nir Levin called on UEFA to look at the incident.
437	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	But European football's governing body have since confirmed to Rangers that they will not be taking the matter further, ensuring Ferguson will not be banned for the return leg at Ibrox next week.
438	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	"Common sense has prevailed," said Smith.
439	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	"After seeing the incident on TV I don't think there was too much in it.
440	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	It was just a reaction from Barry and it was the Hapoel player who was responsible by poking his finger at Barry as he lay on the ground.
441	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	"So we are pleased with UEFA's decision and that the matter is now out of the way."

443	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	British police have arrested a suspect in connection with a series of recent letter bomb attacks which injured eight people, they said Monday.
444	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	The man was held in Cambridge, eastern England, following attacks dating back to January, many of which targeted motoring-related organizations.
445	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	The spate of seven letter bombings took place over a three-week period ending about two weeks ago.
446	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	Six of the seven targeted companies provide services or technology to law enforcement agencies.
447	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	Media speculation about the identity of the bomber has focused on a disgruntled motorist or animal rights extremists.
448	AFP_ENG_20070219.0134.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, police eliminated from their enquiries a man who telephoned a BBC radio show and claimed responsibility for one of the attacks.

456	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Jitters as US consumer inflation jumps by Jitendra Joshi
457	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	US consumer prices jumped in January, the government reported Wednesday, a week after Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned that inflation remains the central bank's top concern.
458	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The data spooked some pundits and Wall Street investors who had hoped that receding inflation could set the stage for a Fed rate cut sometime this year.
459	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"The CPI news takes some of the wind out of the excessively optimistic 'Goldilocks' forecast of moderate economic growth with low inflation," Briefing.com equity analyst Dick Green said.
460	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
461	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
462	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	On a year-on-year basis, the headline consumer price index was up 2.1 percent and the core CPI rose 2.7 percent.
463	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Fed's official forecast calls for core inflation to be in a range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent for 2007.
464	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	That is slightly above what economists see as the central bank's "comfort zone" of under 2.0 percent.
465	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Fed has held its headline interest rate at 5.25 percent since August, highlighting signs of US economic acceleration along with an easing of inflation pressures at its last meeting in January.
466	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
467	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be well controlled," he said.
468	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates."
469	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	And minutes from the January 31 meeting of the Fed's policy committee, released Wednesday, showed that Bernanke and his colleagues "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."
470	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
471	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"Following three consecutive months at 0.1 percent, at first sight, the jump in January core consumer price inflation seems to signal renewed inflationary vigor," Global Insight US economist Kenneth Beauchemin said.
472	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large 0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest such reading since August 1991," he said.
473	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the second half of the year."
474	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April 2005.
475	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
476	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"Yes, there are some strange elements in it but you cannot simply exclude the ones you don't like in the months that don't come out the way you like it."
477	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Naroff cautioned that "investors should not assume that inflation has gone away," as blue-chip US shares sold off on the CPI news.
478	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"And investors should start asking what they should expect for long-term inflation.
479	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."
480	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	In other news Wednesday, the private-sector Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of activity in the coming six to nine months, rose just 0.1 percent last month.
481	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But the December reading was revised up to 0.6 percent.
482	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said the US economy and consumer demand had proved "resilient" to high energy prices and a housing slump.

484	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday dismissed the upcoming Latin American tour of his US nemesis George W. Bush as a "diplomatic offensive" that is doomed to fail.
485	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	"It is a diplomatic offensive ... but it is too late," Chavez said in a news conference.
486	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	"I think the US president has nothing to look for in Latin America.
487	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	It is an offensive destined for the depths of defeat."

489	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	"We, of course, would never invite him because we know what he is," Chavez said, adding that he hoped the 2008 US presidential election would bring a government he can talk with.
490	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Bush is barred from running by term limits.
491	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	"Hopefully, the next US government is one we can talk with, and I say this not only for Venezuela but also the world, because the current US government is a real threat," said Chavez, who has called Bush the devil.
492	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Bush is scheduled to travel to Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico between March 8-14.
493	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	The White House has said the trip will "underscore the commitment of the United States for the Western Hemisphere and will highlight our common agenda to advance freedom, prosperity and social justice."
494	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	US-Venezuelan relations have nose-dived since Chavez was first elected in 1998.
495	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	The South American leader, who was reelected in December, has moved closer to other US foes including Iran and Cuba.
496	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	His domestic critics argue he has moved aggressively to consolidate power over the legislature, courts and other sectors of society, at times struggling with independent media.
497	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Chavez said that in Venezuela "there is so much free expression that some times it goes too far, (Brazilian President Luiz Inacio) Lula (da Silva) once told me so."
498	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	And he lashed out at a Brazilian correspondent with O Globo television who gave a report Chavez saw as critical, saying to the journalist: "You are meddling with something that is sacred: our country's sovereignty."
499	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Chavez also charged that there were new plans to assassinate him, although he did not identify the plotters.

503	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian Serb government apologised Wednesday to Muslim and Croat victims of atrocities during the country's brutal inter- ethnic war in the early 1990s.
504	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The apology came two days after the UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent genocide by Bosnian Serb forces during the Srebrenica massacre.
505	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The government of Bosnia's Serb-run half, Republika Srpska, "expresses its deepest regret for the war crimes committed against non-Serbs during the war in Bosnia," it said in a statement.
506	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	It also called on Muslim and Croat leaders to "do the same in order to ensure a better future for all peoples and citizens of Bosnia."
507	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Republika Srpska would continue to "make maximum efforts to apprehend remaining people responsible for these crimes, notably for the crimes committed in Srebrenica," it added.
508	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Bosnia's Muslim-Croat government was yet to comment on the apology.
509	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In its ruling on Monday, The Hague-based UN court cleared Serbia of direct involvement in genocide during Bosnia's war, but said Belgrade had breached international law over the 1995 slaughter at Srebrenica.
510	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The eastern Bosnian town, then a United Nations-protected enclave, was overrun by Serb forces who summarily killed around 8,000 Muslim males within a few days in the final months of the war.
511	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The massacre is the single worst atrocity in post-war Europe.
512	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Its main culprits, wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic, remain at large.
513	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Mladic is widely believed to be hiding in Serbia and Karadzic in Montenegro or Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia.
514	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Bosnian Serb leaders had for years refused to acknowledge the extent of the Srebrenica massacre.
515	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	But under heavy international pressure in 2004, they admitted in a report their forces murdered Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica and that the perpetrators had tried to cover up the atrocity and its scale.
516	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Following the report, then Bosnian Serb president Dragan Cavic expressed regret and called Srebrenica a "black page" in his people's history.
517	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	A year later the government commission that produced the report handed Bosnia's state court a list of names of some 20,000 Serb soldiers and police deployed in the Srebrenica area at the time of the massacre.
518	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In July 2005, Serbian President Boris Tadic attended a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre in Srebrenica to pay his respects to the victims.
519	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Tadic welcomed Monday's ICJ ruling that exonerated Serbia of direct charges of genocide, but urged fellow politicians and citizens to face up to the Srebrenica massacre.
520	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	"It's important that the Serbian parliament, as soon as possible, passes a declaration condemning the crime in Srebrenica without any doubt," he said.
521	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In 2005, a motion to adopt such an apology failed in the Serbian parliament because parties could not agree whether it should single out Srebrenica or include crimes committed by all sides, as demanded by nationalists.
522	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war split the country into two semi-autonomous entities -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.

524	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	French investigators on Thursday held out little hope of quickly recovering two paintings by Pablo Picasso stolen from the Paris apartment of the artist's granddaughter.
525	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The paintings by the Spanish master worth a total of 50 million euros (66 million dollars) were taken from the flat of Diana Widmaier Picasso as she was sleeping, and without a break-in, in the night of Monday to Tuesday.
526	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"It will be a long and difficult investigation," said a source close to the case.
527	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Investigators were not ruling out any motive for the crime, saying it may have been the work of thieves acting at the behest of an art collector or small-time robbers wanting to get their hands on some valuable loot.
528	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The thieves made off with a 1961 portrait of Picasso's second wife Jacqueline Roque and "Maya with Doll," a painting of Picasso's daughter done in 1938.
529	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	A drawing was also taken.
530	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	A detailed description of the artworks was sent out to all police in France and in neighbouring countries through Interpol, said Bernard Darties, the deputy director of the office overseeing trafficking in cultural goods.
531	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Art dealers and gallery owners have also been notified of the theft, he said.
532	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Darties said that 80 percent of cases involving thefts of major artworks, the perpetrators are "thieves who saw an opportunity", believing that they will cash in on the stolen works "but find themselves unable to sell them."
533	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Many stolen paintings by Picasso have been recovered over the years after police notified the art market of the theft.
534	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The risk however is that the perpetrators may decide to destroy the paintings if they find themselves unable to sell them, said Darties.
535	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The paintings were on display in the apartment located in the chic Left Bank area of Paris, but security precautions had been taken to protect the works, according to Paul Lombard, a lawyer representing the Picasso family.
536	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"Maya With Doll" is one of Picasso's classic oil paintings done in bright shades of green, blue and red and depicting young Maya in pigtails holding a doll and a small wooden horse.
537	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Maya was Widmaier Picasso's mother, born to Marie-Therese Walter, who was one of Picasso's many female companions.
538	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Picasso's 1905 masterpiece "Boy with a Pipe" remains the most expensive painting ever sold since it went under the hammer at a New York auction for 104.2 million dollars in May 2004.
539	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Picasso died on April 8, 1973 at his home in the southern French town of Mougins.

542	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	A senior US official will visit Syria in the coming weeks to discuss the problem of Iraqi refugees, the State Department said Thursday in a new sign of a possible thaw between Washington and Damascus.
543	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbrey will travel to Damascus along with an official of the UN refugee agency as part of a regional tour dealing with "humanitarian issues related to Iraqi refugees in those countries," said department spokesman Sean McCormack.
544	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	Sauerbrey and the UN High Commmisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative will also visit Jordan and possibly other states "in coming weeks," he said.
545	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	The United States withdrew its ambassador from Damascus after Syria was implicated in the February 2005 assassination in Beirut of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri.
546	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	The administration of President George W. Bush has since refused high-level contacts with Syria, which it accuses of backing anti- US insurgents in neighboring Iraq and efforts by the Lebanese Islamic movement Hezbollah to topple the Western-backed government of Lebanon.
547	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	But in a sudden policy shift, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced this week that she and other US officials would join their Syrian and Iranian counterparts at conferences on Iraq's future in the coming weeks.
548	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	McCormack has refused to rule out bilateral contacts with Syrian and Iranian officials on the sidelines of those meetings, but insisted these could only deal with Iraq-related issues and not the myriad other disputes between Washington and the two states.

550	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Native American Cherokees voted to expel descendants of black slaves from their tribe nation in a special election that has prompted charges of racism, according to returns made public early Sunday.
551	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	But a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma adopted Saturday an amendment to their constitution that strips membership from so- called "Freedmen," those descended from slaves once owned by Cherokees, blacks who were married to Cherokees and children of mixed-race families.
552	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"The Cherokee people exercised the most basic democratic right, the right to vote," Chad Smith, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, said in a statement.

554	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	No one else has the right to make that determination."
555	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	However, opponents of the amendment say it was a racist project designed to deny the distribution of US government funds and tribal revenue to those with African-American heritage, US media reported.
556	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"This is a sad chapter in Cherokee history," Taylor Keen, a Cherokee tribal council member who opposes the amendment, told the New York Times.
557	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"But this is not my Cherokee Nation.
558	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	My Cherokee Nation is one that honors all parts of her past."
559	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Advocates of changing the 141-year-old treaty rules defining who is a Cherokee say the tribal nation has a sovereign right to decide citizenship and that other tribes base membership on blood lines.

562	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Cherokees, along with several other tribes, held black slaves and allied themselves with the Confederacy during the US civil war.
563	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	After the war, the federal government in an 1866 treaty ordered the slaves freed.
564	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	In 1983, the Cherokee Nation expelled many descendants of slaves as members but a Cherokee tribunal ruled last year that the Freedmen were fully-fledged citizens with voting rights.

615	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	The son of Bangladesh's outgoing prime minister was remanded in custody on corruption allegations late Monday after a court rejected his application for bail, an official said.
616	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	The capital's main court ruled that Tareque Rahman, son of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia, be detained for a further month, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said.

642	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"Independence under international supervision is the only viable option" for Kosovo, Ahtisaari said in the report that was sent to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon last week.

644	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"The time has come to determine the status of Kosovo," said Ahtisaari, following eight years of UN rule in the province.
645	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"Independence offers the only guarantee against the risk" of instability, he said.
646	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"It's also the only chance for a sustainable partnership with Serbia."
647	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Under the plan, Kosovo would have its own constitution but would "for an initial phase" be placed under the international monitoring of "civilian personnel" named by the European Union.
648	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	NATO forces would continue to be present at the outset and the Serb minority would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, according to the report quoted by Le Monde.

731	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi to 4.0 percent in June.
732	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Trichet said that "there was no discussion" within the ECB's policy-making governing council of possible move this month.
733	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	The decision to hold rates steady was "unanimous", he said.
734	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, even at the current level of interest rates, the ECB's monetary policy stance remained "on the accommodative side", Trichet said.

741	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	The top US nuclear negotiator, Christopher Hill, expressed his frustration and said it was time for North Korea to comply, but also advised caution.
742	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"Needless to say we are not happy that the DPRK has essentially missed this very important deadline," he told a press conference, referring to North Korea by its formal initials.
743	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ball is in their court," Hill said in Beijing, where he earlier spoke with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei.
744	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"China has asked us to be patient for three or four days, that seems like a wise thing to do.
745	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	It's not for the US to take unilateral actions.
746	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"We need to work closely, multilaterally with our partners."
747	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	In Pyongyang, there was no official word Sunday on the nuclear deadline as the nation focused on its festivities.
748	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people filed through the marble mausoleum housing the embalmed body of Kim Il-Sung, who died in 1994 but still retains the title of "eternal president."
749	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	After passing through strict security, visitors bowed four times -- at the feet, head and both sides of Kim's body -- as a revolutionary hymn played.
750	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	Under a February 13 deal, the North was supposed to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor within 60 days -- expiring Saturday -- and to invite UN atomic inspectors back in.
751	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	But the impoverished nation has refused to budge until it has confirmed US assertions that 25 million dollars of cash has been released from a Macau bank where it had been frozen by sanctions since 2005.
752	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"Our patience is not in infinite supply but given the kind of complexities that did arise with some of the banking issues, it is probably prudent to give this a few more days to see if the statement of February 13 is something they are going to follow through on," the State Department official said.
753	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"We're going to see if we can get this back on track.
754	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	We'd like it to be on in the coming days," she added.
755	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	The State Department urged North Korea to turn Yongbyon off immediately, a call echoed by Japan.
756	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"Although the deadline has passed it is still extremely important for North Korea to take initial action as soon as possible," warned Noriyuki Shikata, a Japanese foreign ministry spokesman.
757	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	The banking row is merely the latest hurdle to the six-nation negotiations that China, the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia first launched on Pyongyang's nuclear programme in 2003.
758	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	Efforts took on added urgency last year, when the North test- fired several missiles in July followed in October by its first ever atom bomb test.
759	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	The February 13 accord promises North Korea, one of the world's poorest and most isolated nations, up to one million tons of fuel aid or its equivalent in return for dismantling its nuclear programme.
760	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	A North Korean foreign ministry official told AFP on Friday that Pyongyang stood behind the deal but would not act until it saw the money from the Macau bank.
761	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"There is no reason to be pessimistic," said Kim Son-gyong, deputy director of the ministry's European department.
762	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"We will be faithful to this agreement if the Americans respect its clauses."
763	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Sadr bloc quits Iraqi government
764	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's political movement formally declared its withdrawal from Iraq's beleaguered ruling coalition on Monday at a Baghdad news conference.
765	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Lawmaker Nassar al-Rubaie, flanked by allies from Sadr's 32-strong parliamentary bloc, said the group was pulling out of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's unity government to push its demands for a withdrawal of US troops.
766	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Rubaie read a statement which he said had been issued by Sadr, who has not himself appeared publicly since last year.
767	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	"Considering the public interest, we found that it was necessary to issue an order to the ministers of the Sadr bloc to immediately withdraw from the Iraqi government," the statement said.
768	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	"The six ministries shall be handed over to the government itself, hoping that this government would give these responsibilities to independent bodies who wish to serve the interests of the people and the country."
769	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Rubaie said the group had come to the decision after Maliki ignored the demands of Shiite protesters who demonstrated last week in support of Sadr and demanded a timetable for US troop withdrawal.
770	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	"The main reasons are the prime minister's lack of response to the demands of nearly one million people in Najaf asking for the withdrawal of US forces and the deterioration in security and services," Rubaie told reporters.
771	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	On April 9, a rally organised by the group saw huge crowds of Shiites gather in the holy city of Najaf to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from the war- ravaged country.
772	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Estimates of the total size of the demonstration varied widely, with the US military reporting that 15,000 turned up while Iraqi officials claimed hundreds of thousands took to the streets.
773	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Maliki has steadfastly refused to offer any timetable for withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq, saying any decision on the departure of US-led forces will be guided by the security situation on the ground.
774	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	Ban 'troubled' by US shooting by South Korean national
775	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday said he felt "very troubled" at learning that the perpetrator of the deadliest school shooting in US history was believed to be a fellow South Korean national.
776	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"On this tragic accident, I feel very much sorry and troubled," Ban, a former foreign minister of South Korea, told reporters when asked for his reaction.
777	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"Any such rampant killing of innocent citizens and children is totally not acceptable," he said.
778	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"I condemn it in the strongest terms possible."
779	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	Police in Blacksburg, Virginia on Tuesday said they suspected that Cho Seung- Hui, a 23-year-old South Korean student, killed 32 people at Virginia Tech University before turning the gun on himself Monday.
780	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	Cho, a resident alien, was an undergraduate student in his senior year majoring in English.
781	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israel has no intention of attacking Syria: Olmert
782	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Wednesday that Israel had no intention of attacking Syria this summer, army radio reported.
783	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"Israel has no intention of attacking any Arab country this summer.
784	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	We will defend ourselves if we are attacked," radio quoted Olmert as telling parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, referring to Syria.
785	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israeli military intelligence has reported recently that Syria was reinforcing troops at its border with the occupied Golan Heights, but these "are of a defensive character aimed against a possible Israeli attack," the radio said.
786	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Committee chairman Tsahi Hanegbi said: "It is important that there are no aggressive declarations from our side that can be misunderstood" by the Syrian leadership.
787	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	But Israel "has to be always ready for the worst so as not be taken by surprise as was the case in 1973" when Israeli leaders were unprepared for a coordinated attack from Syria and Egypt, Hanegbi said.
788	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said that Syria and Hezbollah, with which the Jewish state fought a 34-day war last summer, feared a possible attack by Israel if the United States attacks Iran.
789	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"They fear a war initiated by the Americans because they understand that there might be an attack against Iran over the summer, but not by Israel," a senior government official quoted Yadlin as telling cabinet ministers.
790	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Although Yadlin insisted Israel had no intention of becoming embroiled in such a conflict, he warned that any moves by the Jewish state could be wrongly interpreted by its neighbours as a sign of hostile intent.
791	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"If the Americans launch an offensive in Iran, Hezbollah and Syria will think the move had been coordinated with Israel and would expect Israel to strike them too," another government official at the meeting told AFP.
792	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Peace talks between Israel and Syria collapsed in 2000, mainly because of deadlock over the return of the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1981.
793	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israel has repeatedly rejected peace overtures by Syrian President Bashar al- Assad in recent months, saying Damascus must first stop supporting militant groups in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
794	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	Chinese police arrest two in 6.6-mln-dlr heist
795	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	Chinese police have arrested two men who are suspected of stealing about 50 million yuan (6.6 million dollars) in cash from the bank were they worked, state media said Friday.
796	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	The men, both in their 30s, worked as tellers in a branch of Agricultural Bank in north China's Hebei province, the China Daily reported.
797	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	Police caught up with one in east China's Jiangsu Province early Thursday, it said, citing public security ministry spokesman Wu Heping, while the other had been arrested Wednesday in Beijing.
798	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	"Police have recovered some of the missing funds and are questioning the men," said Wu, who lamented the ease at which the men apparently got away with an estimated two tonnes of cash.
799	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	They were seen fleeing the bank in a van shortly after it was noticed that the money was missing last Saturday.
800	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	"This huge loss of funds has exposed major loopholes in crime prevention, especially regarding financial institutions," Wu said.
801	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	"As the investigation continues, we will learn how the suspects succeeded, and we will try to mend the holes in our system."
802	AFP_ENG_20070419.0758.LDC2009T13	Wu said the public had played in crucial role in tracking down the alleged perpetrators after police offered a reward for information.
803	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Head start: Scientists crack beer-froth enigma
804	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	There is the nagging question of whether life exists other than on Earth.
805	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The enduring mystery of who made us -- and why.
806	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	And then there is this: Why does the foam on a pint of lager quickly disappear but the head on a pint of Guinness linger?
807	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Answers to questions 1 and 2 are still being sought, but the Great Beer Riddle, at least, may soon be solved.
808	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Writing in the prestigious British science journal Nature, an elite scientific duo say they have devised an equation to describe beer froth.
809	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The breakthrough will not only settle the vexatious lager vs. stout debate, it will also help the quest to pour a perfect pint every time.
810	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces.
811	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	In other words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid.
812	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension -- and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of the bubbles.
813	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	As a result of this movement, the bubbles merge and the structure "coarsens," meaning that the foam settles and eventually disappears.
814	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Three-dimensional equations to calculate the movement have been made by Robert MacPherson, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and David Srolovitz, a physicist at Yeshiva University, New York.
815	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.
816	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The mathematics of beer-bubble behaviour are similar to the granular structure in metals and ceramics, so the equation also has an outlet in metallurgy and manufacturing as well as in pubs.

846	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Rafael Nadal extended his record run on clay to 69 straight wins as he moved a step closer to a title hat-trick at the Barcelona Open on Thursday.
847	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	The Spanish top seed beat former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson 6-1, 6-4, but not without a spirited comeback from the Swede in a combative second set of the third-round contest.
848	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal said he is under no pressure when he plays, but knows that his charmed life cannot go on forever.
849	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	"I don't think about the record when I'm on the court," said the double Roland Garros winner.

854	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	But Johansson, 32, showed nerve as he re-discovered his survival instincts to turn the second into a struggle at the Real club.

856	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	But Nadal had the last word in front of his home public, breaking for victory in the final game after Johansson followed an ace with a run of errors.
857	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	It took Nadal appropiately 69 minutes to go through.
858	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	The Spaniard is bidding to collect a hat-trick of Barcelona titles, aiming to become the second man after Swede Mats Wilander (1982-1984) to win the event three times on the trot.
859	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	"I controlled the game in the first set but he played well in the second," said the winner.
860	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	"I tried not to let up after winning the first easily.
861	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	"It's unbelievable to win 69 on clay and it's especially nice to play here, where I have so much support."
862	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal improved his Barcelona career record to 13-1, his lone loss coming in 2003 when he was beaten as a teenager in the second round by Alex Corretja.
863	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	He next faces Italian surprise packet Potito Starace, the number 72 who beat Argentine eighth seed Juan Chela 6-4, 7-6 (12-10) in their third-round encounter on a fifth match point.
864	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Fifth seed David Ferrer flew the flag for Spain as he hammered Serb Boris Pashanski 6-2, 7-5.

871	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The bomb was hidden in a motorcycle, parked in front of a shop in Pattani, one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia, Pattani Governor Thanu Uthairat said.
872	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	"The explosion happened around 8:25 pm (1325 GMT) and most of the injured were shoppers," the governor said.

874	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The market bombing capped a day of violence in Pattani, where police found the headless and burned body of a 30-year-old Buddhist man, along with the charred body of his 14-year-old nephew, on a road earlier in the day.
875	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The man's head was discovered a few kilometres (miles) away.

915	AFP_ENG_20070503.0495.LDC2009T13	A Danish court convicted them of illegal entry the following month and fined them approximately 670 euros (910 dollars) each, a ruling confirmed on appeal.
916	AFP_ENG_20070503.0495.LDC2009T13	The three activists argued before the Strasbourg court that because the forbidden area had been neither closed off nor clearly marked out, no punishable crime had been committed.

936	AFP_ENG_20070510.0580.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 176 non-Greeks died and 287 were seriously injured in road accidents around the country, accounting for 11.8 percent and 14 percent of total figures, the public order ministry said.
937	AFP_ENG_20070510.0580.LDC2009T13	"The participation of foreign citizens in traffic accidents is increasing," the ministry said, ordering police departments around the country to organise information initiatives in their areas of responsibility.
938	AFP_ENG_20070510.0580.LDC2009T13	Greece has one of the highest road death tolls in the European Union.

944	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The rubbish crisis in the Naples area deepened Thursday as two treatment centres complained of paralysis and local authorities announced the upcoming closure of a major dump, an official said.
945	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Outside the Caivano treatment centre some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the southern city, about 100 trucks were seen waiting to unload their rubbish.
946	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Another centre that converts rubbish into fuel, located at nearby Giugliano, "is also functioning at a snail's pace", Ilaria Proietti told AFP.
947	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	She added that one of the area's two main dumps, in Villaricca north of Naples, would close on Saturday because it had reached saturation point.
948	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The two-week-old crisis has seen some 15,000 tonnes of waste accumulate along roads in the southern province, including nearly 3,000 tonnes in Naples itself, because of a logjam at overstretched treatment and recycling centres, Proietti said Wednesday.
949	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The crisis poses a "serious health risk," said Proietti, the spokeswoman for an extraordinary commission assigned to the longstanding regional problem.
950	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	New figures were not available Thursday.
951	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Provincial authorities have sent text messages to Naples area residents asking them not to burn their waste in a bid to avoid the spread of toxic substances such as dioxin.
952	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The chronic problem is the result of a lack of space in existing dumps, some of which have been closed by court injunctions after their operations were taken over by organised crime, dubbed the "ecomafia".
953	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	A May 10 decree by the centre-left government creating four new dumps -- fiercely opposed by people living nearby -- will not come into effect for several weeks.

962	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Almost 18 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a top rights group said Friday that the official Chinese government line on the crackdown was overshadowing next year's Beijing Olympic Games.
963	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"China's total failure to account for the massacre of June 4, 1989 casts a pall on its efforts to project a new image and continues to spawn more abuses," New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
964	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	The group accused Beijing of harassing survivors, their families and those who challenged what it called the official "whitewash" of events and said the Chinese government had failed to bring justice to the victims of the massacre.
965	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining dissidents?"
966	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	asked the watchdog's deputy Asia director Sophie Richardson.
967	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"Beijing -- and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games -- will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," she said.
968	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters were killed by military units when the government sent in the troops to end six weeks of pro-democracy protests.
969	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	It remains one of the most sensitive political issues in China.
970	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Human Rights Watch repeated its call for Beijing to overturn a decision labeling the incident a "counter-revolutionary rebellion" and to give fair and open trials to all those convicted over the protests.
971	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	It also wants the Chinese government to issue a list of all those killed and called on Beijing to stop persecuting those who were demanding justice and to prosecute those responsible for the violence.
972	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"In the 14 months leading up to the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Communist Party wants to be seen as a modern, sophisticated nation, one governed by the rule of law," Richardson said.
973	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"But the image the world should not forget is that of a courageous individual facing down a column of tanks, as his fate and that of thousands of other protestors remain unresolved."
974	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Beijing has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown, insisting that its handling of the protest was necessary to ensure China's economic growth and stability.

978	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	A private equity buyout of US medical device group Biomet Inc. was boosted to 11.4 billion dollars, the company said Thursday.
979	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	Biomet, which makes joint replacement devices and other orthopedic products, said its board unanimously recommended the deal to shareholders.
980	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	The private equity funds backing Biomet's buyout -- Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. and TPG -- had struck a deal last year for a 10.9 billion-dollar acquisition.
981	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	But last month, Institutional Shareholder Services, a research firm for shareholders, recommended against the deal, saying it was low in view of the growing market for prosthetic devices.
982	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	"We believe the proposed price for the transaction is fair to Biomet's shareholders," Biomet chairman Niles Noblitt said.
983	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	"We also believe that the investor group's tender offer will deliver superior value to Biomet's shareholders in a more efficient and more immediate fashion than the process provided by the original merger agreement.
984	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	Moreover, this revised offer provides greater certainty and visibility to completion of the transaction."
985	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	The deal requires 75 percent of shareholders to accept the offer, which amounts to 46 dollars per share.
986	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	Biomet, which produces artificial hips and other replacement and orthopedic devices as well as spinal products, had previously engaged in preliminary merger talks with British medical equipment maker Smith and Nephew.

991	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Disney has struggled to make money in India, which has a vast domestic film market, with its "American fare," but believes that an animated story featuring the voices of well-known Indian film stars could be a commercial hit, the report said.

993	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	The Journal said the new joint effort between Disney and Yash Raj Films will be formally announced on Tuesday.
994	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	The new venture's first project will be an animated tale featuring the voices of Bollywood stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.
995	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Yash Raj is one of Bollywood's most established studios and the partnership is likely to produce "at least one animation film per year," Yash Raj's chief executive Sanjeev Kohli was quoted as saying.
996	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	The report also cited Disney executive Shyam P.S. as saying that Disney will start with simple stories mixing singing, dancing, humor and the "in your face" emotion typical of Bollywood-style productions.

1001	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	Australia's third largest bank ANZ announced Tuesday that HSBC regional chief Mike Smith would take over its top job from October 1, in a move expected to consolidate the bank's push into Asia.
1002	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group chairman Charles Goode said Smith, 50, would succeed John McFarlane as the bank's chief executive.
1003	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	Goode said ANZ undertook a global search before selecting Smith, who is currently chief executive and president of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) in Hong Kong, chairman of the Hang Seng and HSBC Malaysia banks, as well as global head of commercial banking for the giant HSBC.
1004	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	"Michael is well qualified to take ANZ forward in its next stage of development," Goode said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange.
1005	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	"He brings ANZ considerable experience of the Asian marketplace and a strong commercial banking background," Goode added.
1006	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	Smith is expected to continue a push into Asia that began during McFarlane's 10 years in charge of ANZ.
1007	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	ANZ last year bought a 19.9 percent stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB), China's biggest rural commercial lender, and 20 percent of the Tianjin City Commercial Bank, also in China.

1011	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	New car sales in Europe fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, dragged down by a poor showing in western Europe despite strong performance further east, the European automobile association ACEA said Wednesday
1012	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	Registrations of new passenger cars in Europe -- comprising the EU members except Cyprus and Malta, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland -- totalled 1,442,518 in May, 1.6 percent down on the figures a year earlier.
1013	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	"New EU member states showed a constant upward trend (11.1 percent) while Western Europe deepened its loss (-2.4 percent)," the ACEA said in a statement.
1014	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	The German car market, the biggest in Europe, was particularly weak, with registrations, dropping 11.1 percent over the period and continuing a downward trend since a sales tax hike at the beginning of the year.
1015	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	The French and British markets were also down, by 2.8 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
1016	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	However, the European Union's newest member states, mostly former communist countries in eastern Europe, continued their upward trend for the fifth month running, with Lithuania (57.1 percent), Slovakia (35.7 percent and Romania (29.8 percent) leading the way, despite considerable percentage falls in Hungary, Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, the Czech Republic.

1022	AFP_ENG_20070614.0510.LDC2009T13	A bomb ripped through a Gaza studio of the official Voice of Palestine radio on Thursday in an attack blamed on Hamas, witnesses said.
1023	AFP_ENG_20070614.0510.LDC2009T13	Palestine TV reported that the Gaza City radio studio was in flames, forcing it to halt broadcasting.
1024	AFP_ENG_20070614.0510.LDC2009T13	The headquarters of the radio station, which is close to Fatah, is in the West Bank political capital of Ramallah.
1025	AFP_ENG_20070614.0510.LDC2009T13	It was the first such attack against Palestinian media blamed on the radical Islamist movement since bitter factional fighting erupted in the Gaza Strip last week in a no-holds-barred conflict that has killed at least 107 people.

1029	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	A glitch with Russian computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) was probably caused by a solar panel installed by American astronauts, a Russian space construction firm said Thursday.
1030	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	"Russian specialists believe that the new solar panel installed by the Atlantis astronauts during their spacewalk could be the origin (of the breakdown)," said Irina Gomenyuk, a spokeswoman for Energia, which designed much of the station.
1031	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	This "new powerful source of energy caused a malfunction of sensitive system elements" on the Russian and American segments of the station, in particular of the electrical supply system, Gomenyuk was quoted as saying by ITAR-TASS.
1032	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	NASA said earlier Thursday that there had been a breakdown in communication with Russian computers that control the ISS's critical oxygen and water supplies.
1033	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	Communications were later restored.

1036	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Friday he recognised the "special difficulty" Malta faced from illegal immigration and said member states must help it tackle the problem.
1037	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"They must put the principle of solidarity into action by providing help to Malta and other member states in managing the influx of illegal immigrants," he told Malta's parliament.
1038	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The island EU nation, with a population of around 400,000, has rescued some 7,000 people in waters off its coast in the last five years, with scores picked up -- some clinging to tuna farm cages, others dead -- in May alone.
1039	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso heard pleas from Malta's government and opposition for EU help with the problem, with Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi saying that "last summer more died crossing the Mediterranean than in the Lebanon conflict."
1040	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The EU Commission president described these events as a "human tragedy for desperate people who are ruthlessly and unforgiveably exploited", and acknowledged the difficulties Malta faced.
1041	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Many people in the rest of Europe were "simply unaware that the search and rescue area and jurisdiction of Malta is larger than the land mass of the United Kingdom, clearly disproportionate to its resources," he said.
1042	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso said that the coordinated maritime patrols between member states launched last month would become a permanent fixture from next January to help patrol the 27-nation bloc's southern borders.
1043	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"I set out today my intention that the European patrols network which started operation last May should become from January 2008 a permanent tool available at the request of member states to curb illegal immigration across the Mediterranean and along the south-east Atlantic coasts," he said.
1044	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Migration would be a central theme of the EU-Africa summit later this year, he added, and the EU Commission would draw up practical guidelines for managing Europe's external border, covering search and rescue operations.
1045	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"The commission cannot solve all the problems, not least (because) we don't have boats or planes.
1046	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	But I recognise that more should be done, especially by member states," Barroso said.
1047	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"Member states have planes, member states have boats, have resources which they can put at the disposal of a member state that has special difficulty.
1048	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Some political resistance is yet to be overcome."
1049	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the European Union expressed determination to save the lives of African migrants trying to reach its shores but struggled to find concrete ways to help Malta tackle the problem.

1054	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	The figure included militants killed in the unrest.
1055	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	Despite an upsurge in violence, army-appointed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont insisted that his government would adhere to a peaceful approach.

1057	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	"The problem in the south is complicated and it cannot be solved overnight," he said.
1058	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	The violence has continued despite peace-building measures by Surayud, who came to power following a coup in September 2006.

1067	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	He said this was highlighted by reports that Wall Street investment firm Bear Stearns was taking out 3.2 billion dollars in loans to keep creditors from seizing assets of its money- losing hedge funds hit by mortgage sector losses.
1068	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"In addition, some believe that the initial public offering (IPO) of private behemoth Blackstone Group could signal a market top," Fightmaster said.

1070	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	In floor trading, Blackstone shares were up 18 percent from the offering price at 36.45 dollars.
1071	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Al Goldman, market strategist at AG Edwards, said he believes the subprime jitters have provided an excuse to sell but that the market needs to pause after the big runup of the past few months.
1072	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"We believe the subprime problems have been widely publicized and thus pretty well discounted," he said.

1078	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the Wall Street bank appeared to be moving to avoid a "fire sale" of those assets.
1079	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"The mere mention of the term 'fire sale' puts the capital markets on edge, but the notion that a loan agreement of some sort is being worked out to prevent that is helping to calm some of the nervousness," he said.
1080	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"Nonetheless, the Bear Stearns hedge fund situation is providing a reality check for many investors that it is prudent to be more risk averse than they have been recently in their search for high yields."

1115	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	The UN's first ever survey on the Compact published this week also revealed major shortcomings in a sample of about 400 participants, especially in two key fields -- human rights and anti-corruption -- despite overall progress.
1116	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	At least one of the companies with participants registered for the meeting, electric engineering giant Siemens, is embroiled in corruption investigations in Germany, including on suspicion of setting up a slush-fund to obtain foreign contracts.
1117	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	The British- based group Action Aid said the Global Compact had failed to stop corporate human rights violations.
1118	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	"The UN's Global Compact is flawed because it's entirely voluntary," said the group's trade head, Aftab Alam Khan, calling for legally-binding regulations on some 77,000 multinational companies.
1119	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	"It has been a mockery because several companies violating human rights have been free to join and remain in the Global Compact -- benefiting from an association with the UN," Khan added in a statement.
1120	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	Action Aid notably questioned the role played by subsidiaries of mining giant Anglo American -- who's chairman Mark Moody-Stuart is on the Compact's advisory council -- in Ghana and South Africa.
1121	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	Kell said the United Nations delisted 600 companies last year for the first time and another 500 could be removed this year because of shortcomings in their reporting on implementation of the Compact's principles.
1122	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Queen will not be questioned in Diana inquest: British judge
1123	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip will not be approached by officials investigating princess Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash, a British coroner said Monday.
1124	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Michael Mansfield, lawyer for Mohammed Al-Fayed, father of Diana's boyfriend Dodi who also died in the smash, wanted the monarch to agree to be "a potential witness" and her husband to "answer inquiries."
1125	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	But the senior judge leading the inquest, Lord Justice Scott Baker, said this would not be "appropriate or necessary" at the moment, while pledging to keep the position "under review."
1126	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Fayed believes that Diana was pregnant with his son's child when she died on August 31, 1997 and that they were murdered in a plot masterminded by Philip.
1127	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	The exchanges came at the latest preliminary hearing at London's High Court ahead of a long-delayed inquest which is expected finally to get under way in October.
1128	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Under British law, inquests are only used to establish basic facts about a death and cannot determine blame or liability.
1129	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	Mansfield said he wanted the monarch to be questioned about an alleged conversation when she allegedly warned former royal butler Paul Burrell of "other forces or powers at work within the state."
1130	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	It also emerged at Monday's hearing that a note sent to Burrell by Diana, in which she claimed that her then husband, Prince Charles, "is planning an accident in my car," had been secured for use at the inquest.
1131	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	The next pre-inquest hearing is due to take place on July 27.
1132	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	A report on the crash by Lord John Stevens, the former head of London's Metropolitan Police, last December found it was an accident.
1133	AFP_ENG_20070709.0359.LDC2009T13	It added that the couple's chauffeur, Henri Paul, was well over the legal alcohol limit for driving and was speeding.
1134	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Danish drivers offered insurance against speeding tickets
1135	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Danish motorists can now sign an insurance policy against speeding tickets, the Danish car enthusiasts' club Fartklubben announced on Tuesday.
1136	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	For an annual membership fee of 995 kroner (134 euros, 183 dollars), members of the "Speeding Club" can have up to four fines reimbursed a year, with a maximum reimbursement of 10,000 Danish kroner (1,344 euros, 1,836 dollars).
1137	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	For an additional fee of 395 kroner (53 euros, 72 dollars), the club also offers to pay up to four parking tickets a year, totalling no more than 2,000 kroner (269 euros, 367 dollars).
1138	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"The increasing number of speed checks with fines ranging between 500 and 7,000 kroner and more could lead to unexpected costs that could seriously harm many people's personal finances," the club wrote on its website.
1139	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	It estimated that 250,000 people had received speeding fines in 2006.
1140	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Poul Winther, the head of Fartklubben, told the free daily newspaper Urban that the initiative was not aimed at "urging (the drivers) to drive faster."
1141	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"But the police and the politicians are exploiting the fact that our cars can drive faster today to install radars which are cash cows," he said.
1142	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	The Danish Road Safety Council said meanwhile the initiative was foolish.
1143	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"If you can now take out insurance against dangerous behaviour, it is a serious attack against the road safety which has already seen a negative development due to the increased number of speeding offenses," Council official Jesper Soelund told Urban.
1144	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Golf: Cabrera dreaming of Open double by by Angus MacKinnon
1145	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	US Open champion Angel Cabrera believes the boost he received from last month's unexpected triumph at Oakmont can carry him all the way to a second major title at next week's British Open.
1146	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	The powerful Argentinian, nick-named 'the duck' because of his waddling gait, admits that the lay-out of Carnoustie, the Scottish links that will host the 136th Open Championship from July 19-22, is not as well-suited to his game as some of the other venues for the oldest major.
1147	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	But that consideration, he feels, is more than offset by the psychological breakthrough he achieved in holding off the final- day challenge of Tiger Woods to become the US Open's first Argentinian winner.
1148	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"Mentally it gives me a lot of confidence," Cabrera reflected ahead of this week's Scottish Open, where his compatriot and mentor Eduardo Romero triumphed in 2002.
1149	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I know now that I can beat the best players in the world and that I can win major championships.
1150	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I feel that I could win the Open on certain golf courses and I think I have a chance to win at Carnoustie.
1151	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"That said, the course doesn't really favour me.
1152	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	It's tough and if you play badly you're going to shoot over par, and the weather conditions are going to be a factor."
1153	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Along with the enhanced belief, Romero admits he has had to deal with the enhanced expectations that go along with his new-found status.
1154	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It is a little bit hard but that is what comes with winning a major," he said.
1155	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"You have to deal with the pressure of the public, the crowds, the press and everybody."
1156	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Among those who have been keen to bask in some of the glory reflected from Cabrera's achievement is Argentina's President, Nestor Kirchner, who has invited the former caddie from Cordoba for dinner at his presidential residence.
1157	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I've had so many invitations but I've not been able to go to all of them because of my tight schedule," Cabrera revealed.
1158	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"But I will meet the President for dinner when I get back."
1159	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	When the Open was last played at Carnoustie, in 1999, the course was famously dubbed Car-nasty by some of the disgruntled players who found the thick rough virtually impossible to deal with.
1160	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	More than half the field ran up at least one round of 80 or higher and unheralded Scot Paul Lawrie finally came through the field to win the tournament with a six-over par four-round total.
1161	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Organisers have attempted to create a fairer test this year with the rough cut back significantly and some subtle changes introduced to take some of the sting out of the holes that caused most problems last time around.
1162	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It looks like they are going to let the weather dictate scoring this year rather than how it was in 1999," said US-based English star Luke Donald, who missed the cut that year in what was his major tournament debut.
1163	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"On the (par five) sixth the lay-up area was squeezed into 12-15 yards max and remember you are hitting drive and a two iron to lay up where you would be hitting a six or seven iron for your third shot," he recalled.
1164	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I think a few holes were definitely a little bit narrower."
1165	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	That view was confirmed by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, who got an early practice round in last Sunday before heading for Loch Lomond.
1166	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"The course is in magnificent shape," he reported.
1167	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It is nothing like the course we played the last time the Open was there.
1168	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	We've got a chance of finding our ball if it goes in the rough.
1169	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	If there is a bit of wind it is going to play tough, but it's going to play fair."

1171	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	South Korea on Thursday raised its key interest rate for the first time in almost a year in an apparent attempt to curb high liquidity growth.
1172	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	At its monthly rate-setting session, the Bank of Korea increased the July target for the call rate by 0.25 percentage point to a six-year high of 4.75 percent.
1173	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The call rate, the interest on overnight interbank loans, had been left at 4.5 percent since September 2006 in an attempt to spur economic growth amid subdued inflation.
1174	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Analysts had increasingly expected an increase amid repeated official warnings of rapidly growing liquidity.
1175	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Money supply growth rebounded in May.
1176	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The outstanding liquidity aggregate expanded 1.3 percent month-on-month to 1,913.5 trillion won (2.08 trillion dollars) as of the end of May after rising 0.7 percent in April.
1177	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Lenders continued extending loans to smaller companies to offset decreasing mortgage business.
1178	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	In the first half of this year, new loans to smaller companies rose 1.7 times from a year earlier.
1179	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Apparently confident that a rate rise will not curb the economic recovery, the central bank this week raised its 2007 growth estimate by 0.1 percentage point to 4.5 percent.
1180	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	It said economic expansion would speed up next year.
1181	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the government similarly increased its growth forecast to 4.6 percent.
1182	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Industrial output grew a higher-than-expected 6.6 percent in May while exports in June grew 15.9 percent year-on-year to a record 32.3 billion dollars.
1183	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Inflation was 2.5 percent in June due to global oil price rises, accelerating from 2.3 percent in May.
1184	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The June figure, however, stayed within the central bank's target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for 2007-09.

1186	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The Vatican's ambassador in Spain accused the country's media of "discrimination" on Wednesday for giving what he said was too much attention to a sexual abuse scandal involving priests in the United States.
1187	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	"If you read the newspapers you will find the same cases every day, sometimes filling an entire page.
1188	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	You see bad intentions there," Archbishop Manuel Moneteiro de Castro told reporters in the central Spanish town of Aranjuez.
1189	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	"This is called discrimination, no matter how good one wants to be," he added.
1190	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	His comments came two days after the Los Angeles archdiocese agreed to a record 660 million dollar (480 million euro) payout to 508 people who were sexually abused by priests in cases dating back to the 1940s.
1191	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The case has dominated headlines in Spain this week.
1192	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	Centre-left daily El Pais dedicated an entire page to the US priest sex scandal on Wednesday under the headline: "The abuse that did not go to trial".
1193	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	Spain has passed from being a bastion of Roman Catholicism to a predominantly secular society in less than a generation.
1194	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	While 80 percent of Spaniards call themselves Catholics only one in five go to mass, according to a study published last year.
1195	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The Church meanwhile feels under siege from the Socialist government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which has legalised gay marriage and taken steps to loosen the ties between church and state since coming to power in 2004.

1198	AFP_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Indonesian prosecutors on Monday recommended the death sentence for a Muslim militant accused of terrorism, including a market bomb attack that killed eight people on Sulawesi island.
1199	AFP_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Rudy Tailang told the South Jakarta district court that defendant Abdul Muis, alias Muin, 24, was involved in the December 2005 bombing of a meat market in the restive town of Palu.

1203	AFP_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Muis is also accused of taking part in the assassination of a Christian minister in Palu in October 2006.
1204	AFP_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Central Sulawesi, especially Palu, and Poso and its surrounding district, has been the scene of sporadic unrest since violence between Muslims and Christians claimed around 1,000 lives in 2000 and 2001.

1238	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England outmuscled Wales up front, their pack utterly dominant and the 57-point margin of victory was the best in Anglo-Welsh Test history surpassing England's 50-10 win at Twickenham in 2002.
1239	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	But despite their try count concerns remained about England's attacking threat beyond the close-quarter exchanges with a couple of scores botched by poor handling and a failure to utilise overlaps.
1240	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England, who could meet Wales in the quarter-finals of the World Cup, which starts next month, are sure to face a sterner test when tournament hosts France visit Twickenham on August 11 and Ashton said there was still room for England, who've won just five of their last 17 Tests, to improve.
1241	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"What really annoyed me was that there was one phase in the the second half where we were in the Welsh 22 for five minutes where Jason Robinson was stood totally unmarked on the wing, 15 metres out, with the play going around him and was completely ignored," Ashton said.
1242	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"Jason on his own against three defenders, you give him the ball in that situation and I think there were two or three occasions where we did create opportunities and the communication system broke down for some reason.
1243	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	That's what I'll be looking to improve."
1244	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	One longstanding criticism of England is that they place too much reliance on their pack and, as a consequence, can come unstuck when they face top-class sides such as New Zealand, the World Cup favourites, and South Africa who can match them physically.
1245	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	However, Ashton was adamant England hadn't simply played a 'nine- man' game against Wales.
1246	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't all that tight a game at all.
1247	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	There was a real mixture," he said.
1248	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"In the first half I remember our backs taking their guys on in the middle of the field one-on-one and making clean line breaks which we should have finished off.
1249	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"There's not much point whizzing the ball all over the park when you are five metres out and you've got a pack that can score without passing it.
1250	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"The good news was we showed quite a bit of balance to our game.
1251	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half and our kicking game came into play with our last two tries."
1252	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England scrum-half Shaun Perry, a constant threat to Wales from around the fringes was one of the home side's try scorers along with Steve Borthwick, Lawrence Dallaglio, Robinson and Mathew Tait.
1253	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	Perry, told to lose weight by Ashton during England's 2-0 series defeat against South Africa in June, was named man-of-the-match and the England coach also praised the midfield duo of debutant Dan Hipkiss and former Great Britain rugby league captain Andy Farrell
1254	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He has worked incredibly hard after a pretty informal chat in South Africa about his body shape," said Ashton of Perry.
1255	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He looks a better player for it.
1256	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"That was the best game Andy Farrell has played in an England shirt without a shadow of a doubt.
1257	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He very rarely makes mistakes, his distribution is good and he puts players through holes.
1258	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He played like Andy Farrell can play.
1259	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"And I thought Danny did some good stuff.
1260	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He didn't look out of place, he didn't look fazed at all.
1261	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	That is pressure at the highest level, coming in for his first cap, knowing you have to make a statement otherwise you might not get selected for the World Cup.
1262	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"I was pretty pleased with the performance.
1263	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	If someone said we would win 62-5 I would have found it hard to believe."
1264	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	The World Cup squad deadline day of August 14, when coaches of all sides must name their final 30-man parties, comes before England's final warm-up match against France in Marseille on August 18.

1266	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	At least two people were killed and four injured after a possible bomb blast Saturday in an area in Indonesia's East Java that was being monitored by an anti-terrorist unit, police said.
1267	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	"So far two people are dead.
1268	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	Twelve houses are damaged, including three badly destroyed, so we can say it was a big explosion, but we will confirm after more extensive investigation," national police spokesman Sisno Adiwinoto said.
1269	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	"We found aluminum foil around the blast scene, so it's possible that this came from a bomb, but we cannot confirm yet what type," he told ElShinta radio.
1270	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	The blast occurred in Pasuruan, a town about 50 kilometres (30 miles) southeast of Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city.
1271	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	Asked about whether the blast may have been related to Islamic militant activity, he said Indonesia's anti-terror unit, Detachment 88, had "been monitoring activities in the area, but I cannot confirm specifically the whereabouts, so let's just wait."
1272	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	The owner of the house where the blast originated was being held for questioning, he added.
1273	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	A doctor told the radio station that four people had also been hurt.
1274	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	"Four people were rushed here.
1275	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	One of them is in a critical condition with head injuries," said Fitri, speaking from a local hospital.
1276	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	Indonesian police have made multiple arrests of Islamic militants in East Java in recent years.
1277	AFP_ENG_20070811.0272.LDC2009T13	Indonesia's most wanted man, Malaysian Noordin Mohammad Top, was at times thought to have been on the run in the area, but he has repeatedly eluded police.

1279	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	A 13-year-old Egyptian boy who had lost consciousness while in police detention died in the Nile Delta town of Mansura on Sunday, four days after his release, a legal source said.
1280	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The family of Mohamed Mamduh Abdel Aziz, who had been arrested for theft, have filed a complaint against the police, claiming they tortured their son to death, the source said.
1281	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The boy died at Mansura hospital, where he was brought four days earlier after police released him.
1282	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The source said the boy had lost consciousness during his six days in police detention, apparently after being violently beaten.
1283	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said it has documented 567 cases of torture in police custody of which 167 resulted in death since 1993.
1284	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The report was based on individual testimonies, legal cases and medical and autopsy reports and included 26 cases of police torture recorded this year alone, which resulted in three deaths.
1285	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	According to London-based Amnesty International, torture in detention is systematic in Egypt and, in the majority of cases, the perpetrators are not brought to justice.
1286	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	EU to resume Gaza fuel aid after days of blackouts
1287	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The European Union said it will resume financing fuel deliveries to the Gaza Strip's sole power plant on Wednesday, after five days of blackouts in the impoverished Palestinian territory.
1288	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"In agreement with the Palestinian Authority, the (European) commission will resume Wednesday, on a provisional basis, deliveries of fuel to the Gaza power plant," said a statement from an EU spokeswoman received by AFP in Jerusalem.
1289	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	No further details were immediately available.
1290	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU suspended financing fuel deliveries for Gaza's power plant -- which provides some 25 percent of electricity in the territory -- over fears that Hamas would benefit from the aid.
1291	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU blacklists Hamas as a terror group and refuses to have any dealings with the Islamists.
1292	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	If it provides fuel to a power plant, and Hamas earns money from that plant's production, the bloc could be seen to be indirectly financing the movement.
1293	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
1294	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
1295	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would function independently.
1296	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"To ensure the people's right to be free of electrical power cuts, the government will give verifiable guarantees that the electricity company will work independently as mandated and without any interference from the factions," the office of sacked Hamas premier Ismail Haniya said in a statement.
1297	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
1298	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
1299	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Western-backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called for the fuel supplies to be resumed, but said his Hamas rivals were to blame for the outages as it was pocketing money from electricity sales.
1300	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
1301	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	He said the fuel cuts were "the result of the illegal takeover of control electricity company by the Hamas putschists, and the collecting of citizens' (electricity) bills to pay members of its militia."
1302	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
1303	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15, with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.
1304	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Egypt, which provides between five and 10 percent of Gaza's electricity, said the supplies should not be used for political ends.
1305	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"Agreements to supply electricity to Gaza's inhabitants should remain as they are and no party, whoever they might be, should use basic utilities as poitical cards," foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said in a statement.

1308	AFP_ENG_20070822.0248.LDC2009T13	"We have sold around 2.05 million tickets and it's not finished since we're still shifting some 1,500 a day, and the tickets returned to us are regularly put on sale," said committee head Bernard Lapasset, adding that the goal of selling 85 percent of the tickets had been fulfilled.
1309	AFP_ENG_20070822.0248.LDC2009T13	"We're encountering some difficulties in Edinburgh for the Scotland v Romania match, and in Cardiff for Wales v Japan and Fiji v Canada, for which 20,000 tickets have been sold with one month to go before the game," Lapasset said.
1310	AFP_ENG_20070822.0248.LDC2009T13	"I regret not having signed an agreement in 1999 with the Welsh so they could hand back some matches to us," said Lapasset, the president of the French Rugby Federation.

1320	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	North Korea said Saturday that at least 600 people are dead or missing following devastating floods, twice the previous official toll.
1321	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	Torrential rain, strong winds and landslides left at least 600 people dead or missing and thousands of people injured, the official Korean Central News Agency said, citing figures from the Central Statistics Bureau.
1322	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	Official figures quoted by relief agencies earlier spoke of about 300 dead or missing.
1323	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency, in its starkest assessment so far of the damage, said the downpours earlier this month "caused huge material losses to the (country), creating unprecedented difficulties in people's living and economic construction."
1324	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	It said the homes of at least 240,000 families were totally or partially destroyed or inundated, leaving at least 100,000 people totally homeless and some 900,000 others flood-stricken.

1374	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Better known for his defiance on Iran's nuclear programme, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Tuesday revealed he was a handy cook who prepares "delicious" food and regrets not spending more time at home.
1375	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	In a television interview aimed at showing his personal side, Ahmadinejad made no mention of Iran's disputes with the West and instead portrayed himself as a hardworking husband who only leaves his job in the small hours.
1376	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	"Before (I became president) I used to do the grocery shopping.
1377	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Now sometimes I help in the kitchen and I know how to make all the Iranian food," Ahmadinejad said.
1378	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Pressed by the interviewer for more details, Ahmadinejad continued in typically defiant fashion.
1379	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	"Of course what I make is delicious -- ask everyone who has eaten it!
1380	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	I can make all the different kinds of soups and Iranian stews," said the president.
1381	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad, who has long boasted of his ability to work hard, said he is often at his desk by 5:30 am and sometimes does not leave until after midnight.
1382	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	"I used to visit my relatives more but now I do so less.
1383	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	I see them when they are all in one place, but I regularly visit my mother and when I visit her the rest come to see me."
1384	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	While sparking international controversy for comments predicting that Israel is doomed to disappear, Ahmadinejad has also sought to cultivate an image as a simple peace-loving man who offers friendship to everyone.
1385	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	But like almost all Iranian politicians, Ahmadinejad's private life remains a closely guarded secret, and his wife, two sons and daughter are rarely seen in public.

1387	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	A handful of Diana fans gathered late Thursday at the Paris site where the princess's car crashed 10 years ago, almost hour for hour.
1388	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	The Alma tunnel, on the north bank of the River Seine, is a must- see spot for tourists who are drawn to the site where the 36 -year-old Diana crashed shortly after midnight on August 31, 1997.
1389	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Britain is marking the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana's death Friday with a royal memorial service to the "people's princess."
1390	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	No official events are planned in Paris, but well-wishers have left dozens of bouquets and photo tributes at the foot of a sculpture of a giant golden flame above the tunnel, which has become an ad-hoc shrine since her death.
1391	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	And some wanted to be here near the very hour of the tragedy, which happened at 26 minutes past midnight (2226 GMT) -- to see the spot in the middle of the night, and to take photographs.
1392	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's a coincidence we are here in Paris on the anniversary of her death," said Anna Gould, 34, who came here from Devon with her husband Ken, 42, and their three daughters aged 13, nine and four.
1393	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"But I was eager to see the place and to show it to the girls.
1394	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Diana was really the people's princess, she did a lot of good, the old bunch at the palace just couldn't take it."
1395	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"Diana was a lovely and generous princess, but Prince Charles and his mother the Queen were so nasty to her that she died heart- broken," she said.
1396	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	On the afternoon of August 30, 1997, Diana -- who was then divorced from Prince Charles, father of her sons -- flew into the French capital from Sardinia with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, 42.
1397	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	After several hours shopping, the couple dined at the exclusive Ritz hotel owned by Fayed's father, the Egyptian millionaire and Harrods magnate Mohamed Al Fayed.
1398	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	They left at around midnight in a car driven by the deputy head of security at the Ritz, Henri Paul, who was called back after an evening off duty to help smuggle the couple from the hotel unseen by the paparazzi posted outside.
1399	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Some paparazzi were taken in by the ploy, but others set out in pursuit of Paul's Mercedes, headed at high speed towards the Champs-Elysees avenue.
1400	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	At 26 minutes past midnight, after running a red light on the Place de la Concorde, the Mercedes went out of control at high speed and crashed into a support pillar in the Alma underpass.
1401	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	The driver was killed instantly, Dodi died as emergency services arrived and the princess was declared dead in a Paris hospital at 4:00 am.
1402	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Despite many conspiracy theories, propagated by the likes of Al Fayed, French police insist Diana's death was a tragic accident.
1403	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	But at the site, a strange inscription looms, referring to Diana's sons William and Harry, and sending a chill down the spines of visitors: "Your sons will want to know, if they let them live..."

1405	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	One of Australia's top racecourses was put under a strict lockdown Thursday after a racehorse tested positive for equine influenza, as the virulent bug appeared to spread to the thoroughbred industry.
1406	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Vets were urgently carrying out tests to confirm whether the horse at Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse was infected, but the initial outcome appeared to realise the racing industry's worst fears, officials said.
1407	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"We have taken a second test but the first one showed all the signs of being positive," Racing New South Wales chief executive Peter V'Landys said.
1408	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The previous tests have been accurate so we are holding little hope.
1409	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The test on the second sample will be expedited and we should know for certain later," he said.
1410	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It is such bad news."
1411	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Trainer Anthony Cummings said the suspect horse had an elevated temperature but he was hoping tests would still clear the animal of infection.
1412	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"I'm still hopeful there is an outside chance the test will come back negative," Cummings told Australian radio.
1413	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The symptoms are not present in him or the horses around him but we will wait and see."
1414	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The unprecedented outbreak of equine flu in Australia was first detected among recreational and pleasure horses a week ago, forcing a halt to all movements of horses across the country and a cancellation of all race meetings.
1415	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The outbreak has left the multi-billion dollar racing industry reeling and wiped millions in turnover from the major betting firms.
1416	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	But racing was expected to resume this weekend in all states apart from Queensland and New South Wales, where officials had hoped they could restart races in a limited form in the next couple of weeks.
1417	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	If the positive result for horse flu in a thoroughbred is confirmed, the racing calendar in New South Wales is likely to remain blank for some time, with experts predicting Randwick will be locked down for at least a month
1418	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian McDonald says the state's spring racing carnival, the premier event for the year, was is in jeopardy if equine influenza was confirmed among the thoroughbreds as Randwick.
1419	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It would then place the place under total quarantine, and there wouldn't be any possibility for racing for quite some time," McDonald told ABC radio.
1420	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Some 700 thoroughbreds are stabled at Randwick and trainer John O'Shea said the racing community was despondent about the prospect of a horse flu outbreak.
1421	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"Once one horse is diagnosed, we all know there is just a matter of time before all our horses are infected with the same disease," he said.
1422	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"My staff, myself and my owners, we live for the spring carnival.
1423	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	It's the two or three months of the year where that's what's it's about, being involved in the racing industry.
1424	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"That's now been taken away from us and it's horribly unlikely that we'll be back racing in the next two to three months."
1425	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	There have even been reports that race organisers could saddle up camels or hold phantom meetings without spectators in a bid to satisfy punters unable to place a bet because of the ban.

1427	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Spain have detected bluetongue in cattle in 47 farms in the southern region of Andalusia, a regional government official said Friday.
1428	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	The councillor in charge of agriculture in Andalucia’s regional government, Isaias Perez Saldana, told a news conference the disease could spread to the southwestern region of Extremadura and the central region of Castile-La Mancha.
1429	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Rules restricting the movement of livestock in the affected farms, as well as in farms found within a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius, would be "rigourously applied," he said.
1430	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Bluetongue affects affects ruminants -- animals such as cows and sheep which chew the cud -- but not humans.
1431	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	It is transmitted by insects and causes high fevers, mouth ulcers, swollen heads and turns an infected animal's tongue blue.
1432	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	The disease has hit livestock in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and northern France in the past year after previously being confined to countries on the Mediterranean basin.

1438	AFP_ENG_20070901.0102.LDC2009T13	Twenty five warships from Australia, India, Japan, Singapore and the United States will take part in the exercises over five days starting on Tuesday in the Bay of Bengal.

1451	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Bush hints at US troop reduction in Iraq
1452	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush, on a surprise visit to Iraq Monday, said a reduction in combat troops was possible but sniped at "nervous" US politicians ahead of a showdown with Congress.
1453	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Bush flew from Washington in total secrecy to this desert base in Anbar province, where the US administration has taken heart from the sight of former Sunni insurgents joining with US forces to fight Al-Qaeda extremists.
1454	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	He convened a meeting of his "war council" with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders just days before US commander General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker report to Congress on the progress of Bush's troop "surge" strategy.
1455	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker tell me if the kind of success we are now seeing (in Anbar) continues, it is possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces," Bush said before leaving Iraq a few hours later for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Australia.
1456	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"I urge members of Congress to listen to what (Petraeus and Crocker) have to say," he said, against a backdrop of two military Humvees spotlit in the gathering night.
1457	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Bush's trip coincided with the withdrawal of British troops from their last base in the southern city of Basra amid tensions between Washington and its top ally Britain over their policy in Iraq.
1458	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"This is the last big gathering of the president's military advisors and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on the way forward," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.
1459	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The White House is to make a formal report to Congress by September 15 aimed at persuading US lawmakers to continue funding the Iraq war, four and a half bloody years since the US-led invasion of 2003.
1460	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Staging a surprise detour from his trip to Sydney, Bush arrived at the Al-Asad air base in Anbar along with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley.
1461	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Waiting for him were US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Fallon, the commander of US forces in the Middle East, and Petraeus.
1462	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he sees as improved security.
1463	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"So the issue is are we at the point where we can continue to make security progress with X number of forces?"
1464	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said.
1465	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
1466	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003.
1467	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Opposition Democrats who control the House of Representatives and Senate have been pushing for months to force a deadline for US troops to leave.
1468	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But Bush and his generals have argued for time to make the troop surge work after the US military deployed 28,500 extra soldiers in February to try and end the violence.
1469	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
1470	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the conditions on the ground, not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media," the president said.
1471	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
1472	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
1473	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Gates said the general view was that security has improved not just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of the surge.
1474	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some (areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape," Gates told reporters.
1475	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But security officials said that shortly before Bush's arrival, two car bombs went off in Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi, killing four people and wounding 10.
1476	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, police found 15 corpses of men shot dead.
1477	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The president's visit came just hours after 500 British troops slipped out of their last base in Basra Palace under cover of darkness, leaving behind a city in the grip of a brutal militia turf war.
1478	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Iraqi soldiers hoisted the Iraqi flag and posted guards outside the palace complex, which General Mohan Farhad, commander of Basra military operations, said would remain under Iraqi military control until Maliki decides its fate.
1479	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The evacuation of the troops to a desert airbase west of Basra paves the way for a full British handover of security in the region to Iraqi authorities, which could take place in the autumn.
1480	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	There are about 5,500 British troops in Iraq, most based in and around Basra, although that number is set to drop to around 5,000 by the end of the year.
1481	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Gordon Brown stressed that British forces stood ready to "re- intervene" in Basra if the security situation demanded, telling BBC radio: "This is a pre-planned and this is an organised move."
1482	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Locals cheered the withdrawal, despite warnings the city could descend further into chaos.
1483	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"We are happy to be rid of the British.
1484	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	They were harassing us in the streets and raided our houses and arrested our sons," said army officer Sadoun Hami, demanding they quit the Basra area altogether.
1485	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The United States and Britain have been at odds over Iraq recently, with US officials voicing frustration at deteriorating security in Basra.

1491	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The secretive regime took the unusual step of issuing a statement directly to the news media, accusing the National League for Democracy (NLD) of trying to instigate nationwide unrest.

1494	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government also blamed the party, which is headed by the detained Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for inciting Buddhist monks in the central town of Pakokku to destroy the homes and shops of pro-junta militia leaders.
1495	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The monks also held about 20 government officials hostage for several hours on Thursday, in the most dramatic standoff with the regime since the protests broke out on August 19.
1496	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"Under these circumstances, the government will never tolerate such malicious acts and will take effective action against those committing such acts in accordance with the existing law," the statement said.
1497	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Normally such statements would be filtered through official media, sometimes several days later, but the three-page document dated Saturday was given directly to journalists on Sunday and reported immediately in the state press.
1498	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have been arrested over the protests, which were sparked by a massive hike in fuel prices last month.
1499	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government again defended the price hike in the statement Sunday, saying it was necessary because of high world oil prices that had made fuel subsidies unaffordable.
1500	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's crackdown on dissent has sparked an international outcry, with US President George W. Bush lashing the junta as "tyrannical."
1501	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	German scientists spotted Indonesian quake within five minutes
1502	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	German researchers said they measured the size and location of Wednesday's earthquake off Indonesia within a record five minutes in a development that could mean the difference between life and death for people in the path of a tsunami.
1503	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"We managed to get the information in under five minutes yesterday," Professor Joachim Zschau from Germany's national research centre for geoscience (GFZ) in Potsdam outside Berlin, told AFP on Thursday.
1504	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"In the past this was not possible, we could get it at best in under a quarter of an hour to half an hour," he said.
1505	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The German reaction time on Wednesday was more than 10 minutes faster than the alert raised by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii, which measures earthquakes around the ocean's massive faultline.
1506	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"The difference in time is really important because the challenge is to warn people away from the coastline within minutes.
1507	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	It takes 10 to 20 minutes before a tsunami hits the coastline," he said.
1508	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"If you have the information this soon after the earthquake hits, you could get information to hotels and villages and avert a potential disaster."
1509	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The 8.4-magnitude quake that struck off the west coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island was measured with software that the Germans had been developing even before the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster which killed 168,000 people in the island's Aceh province alone.
1510	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The GFZ's Alexander Rudloff said information was relayed via satellite from 11 measuring stations in the ocean to computers in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, where staff alerted the authorities.
1511	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The software system, called the "SeisComP", has been installed at various points around Indonesia as part of a new warning system that should be completed by 2008, he said.
1512	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	One of two components that must still be added to the detection system is a way of measuring where in the ocean a tsunami begins and where it will hit the coast.
1513	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	Zschau said the software had only been installed in recent weeks and his group was "relieved" that it passed a baptism of fire in the series of powerful quakes that has struck in the Pacific around Indonesia since late Wednesday.
1514	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	At least 10 people have died and some 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed, but fears that large-scale destruction mirroring the events of 2004 have so far proved unfounded.
1515	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The latest quake hit off the northern tip of Sulawesi Island early on Thursday, like the earlier ones triggering a tsunami warning that was soon cancelled.
1516	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla on Thursday said the nation was better prepared than in the past to deal with earthquakes and tsunami threats.

1518	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	At least 70 foreigners were on a passenger jet that crashed Sunday on Thailand's southern resort island of Phuket, the transport minister said.
1519	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	"The death toll is unclear at the moment but so far we know there were 44 Thai passengers on board and more than 70 foreigners," Sansern Wongcha-um told reporters.
1520	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	At least 61 people died when the MD-82 aircraft, operated by low- cost carrier One-Two-Go, burst into flames and broke in two when it slid off the runway on the island, which is popular with holidaymakers.
1521	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	Officials at one of Phuket's main hospitals told AFP that the 29 people they were treating including citizens from Australia, Austria, Britain, Iran, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.
1522	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	Five were seriously injured, they said.
1523	AFP_ENG_20070916.0296.LDC2009T13	Other hospitals on the island said they were treating people from the Netherlands, Sweden and Thailand.

1610	AFP_ENG_20071010.0114.LDC2009T13	Sutherland, 40, was arrested September 25 west of Los Angeles for driving with an alcohol-level three times above the legal limit, court documents show.
1611	AFP_ENG_20071010.0114.LDC2009T13	The actor was on probation for another drunk driving violation in 2004, for which Los Angeles prosecutor Rocky Delgadillo asked the court he be sentenced to 18 days in jail, in addition to 30 days for the current charge.
1612	AFP_ENG_20071010.0114.LDC2009T13	If the judge adheres to Delgadillo's recommendations, Sutherland would have to serve the first 18-day sentence on December 21, and the other 30-day sentence on July 1, 2008.

1617	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	The yen gained on the dollar and euro in Asian trade Thursday as investors shunned riskier assets amid concerns about slowing US economic growth and prospects of another US interest rate cut, dealers said.
1618	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	The dollar slipped to 114.02 yen in Tokyo morning trade from 114.24 in New York late Wednesday.

1622	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	The National Association of Realtors on Wednesday reported a steeper-than- expected eight percent slide in existing US home sales, heightening concerns about the outlook for the world's largest economy.
1623	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	Market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark lending rate at its two-day meeting next week were also making dollar assets less attractive, dealers said.
1624	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	Investors are speculating about the size of a potential rate cut although another half-point reduction like the one seen in September would be "a little too much since inflation concerns remain," said Suzuki.
1625	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	"But with with the US economy slowing while growth elsewhere in the world remains resilient, the dollar will be pressured," he added.
1626	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	The Australian dollar continued to rise against the greenback towards fresh 23-year highs amid growing expectations of further interest rates rises by Australia's central bank due to stronger- than-expected inflation, dealers said.
1627	AFP_ENG_20071025.0800.LDC2009T13	The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to "not only hike rates by 25 basis points in November but also look for a further 25 basis points hike to 7.0 percent in February," NAB Capital strategist John Kyriakopoulos predicted.

1632	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	It stressed that the two countries had "a long history and excellent tradition of friendship and cooperation with each other."
1633	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	The Vietnamese army paper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said Kim's visit "demonstrates the wish to give a boost to cooperation between the two countries."
1634	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Vietnam, which has just taken its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, is seeking to strengthen its political role on the international stage.
1635	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	The official Vietnam News Agency said the visit by Nong Duc Manh to Pyongyang had already demonstrated Hanoi's wish to take part in "promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula."
1636	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Vietnam and North Korea, which have both fought against the United States, remain allies in politics and ideology.
1637	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	But South Korea has become a leading foreign investor in Vietnam, which opened up to the world in 1986 and since then has seen speedy economic growth and international integration.

1641	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	A senior US official said Monday he discussed the latest sanctions imposed by Washington against Iran with officials in the United Arab Emirates, which is Tehran's top trading partner.
1642	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	"We shared with them some further specifics associated with the announcement several days ago" in order to "help them better understand the direction of US policy," Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David McCormick told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
1643	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The United States on Thursday announced new sanctions aimed at punishing Iran's nuclear ambitions and alleged sponsorship of terrorism.
1644	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The sanctions targeted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, accused of spreading weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the IRGC's elite Quds Force, which was designated as a supporter of terrorism.
1645	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	Three Iranian state-owned banks were also blacklisted, along with IRGC- controlled companies and the logistics arm of Iran's defence ministry.
1646	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick, who met with officials and investors in Abu Dhabi, did not go into details about the discussions on Iran.
1647	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	But he said Washington hoped the sanctions would "result in further action by other countries, will sensitise companies that are doing business with Iran to the potential risk of doing so and the fact that by doing so they may be further advancing these proliferation activities or terrorist financing activities."
1648	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick insisted that the sanctions were aimed at promoting a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff with Iran.
1649	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	Despite already being under UN sanctions, Tehran refuses to suspend its controversial programme of uranium enrichment, which the West fears to be a cover for atomic weapons development, a charge Iran denies.
1650	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick, who visited neighbouring Kuwait on Sunday, was due to meet on Tuesday with business leaders in Dubai, a business hub for Iran.
1651	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The oil-rich UAE, a US ally, is by far Iran's largest global trade partner.
1652	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The Iranian Business Council (IBC) in Dubai puts the number of Iranian companies operating in the city state at close to 10,000.
1653	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	It estimates accumulated assets of Iranians in the UAE to be about 300 billion dollars, while trade between the UAE and Iran reached about 11 billion dollars in 2006.
1654	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick said the primary purpose of his talks in the Gulf was to "reinforce the theme that America is open to investment," given that "there are some concerns in the region about the openness of the US economy."

1656	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	J.P. Losman will start at quarterback for the Buffalo Bills in Sunday's National Football League game against Cincinnati, Buffalo coach Dick Jauron said Tuesday.
1657	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Losman came on for injured rookie Trent Edwards against the New York Jets last weekend and piloted the Bills to a 13-3 victory.
1658	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Jauron, who just one week earlier had tabbed Edwards as his starter, said a sprained right wrist suffered by his rookie quarterback prompted the switch.
1659	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	"J.P. Losman will start Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals," Jauron said in a statement.
1660	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	"Trent Edwards' wrist will prevent him from participating until late in the week, if at all."
1661	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Edwards had been elevated to the starting role when Losman suffered an ankle injury in the third week of the season.

1663	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway said Tuesday it would donate 130 million kroner (17 million euros, 24 million dollars) to help protect the Amazon rain forest, the deforestation of which is leading to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
1664	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norwegian Environment and Development Aid Minister Erik Solheim announced the donation, to be paid over three years, following talks in Oslo with his Brazilian counterpart Marina Silva.
1665	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	"The felling and burning of tropical forests is a significant cause of greenhouse gases," Solheim said in a statement.
1666	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	"The actions necessary to put an end to deforestation will be an important theme during the upcoming climate talks in Bali in December," he added.
1667	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Deforestation currently accounts for 20 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
1668	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	The Bali conference, to be held from December 3 to 14, is tasked with setting a negotiation roadmap for a new deal on deepening emissions cuts when commitments run out under the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.
1669	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway will contribute 60 million kroner to two projects run by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and an additional 70 million kroner to a special rain forest fund.
1670	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	According to Brazilian authorities, 27,429 square kilometers of Amazon rain forest were destroyed between August 2003 and July 2004.
1671	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Between August 2006 and July 2007, after the government adopted measures to protect the forest, the rate of deforestation slowed to 9,600 square kilometers.

1678	AFP_ENG_20071104.0430.LDC2009T13	"England are busy with the (post-World Cup) review process and then they will make a decision.

1680	AFP_ENG_20071104.0430.LDC2009T13	We've been talking to Rob Andrew (Rugby Football Union director of elite rugby)."
1681	AFP_ENG_20071104.0430.LDC2009T13	The RFU have yet to decide if they want to keep coach Brian Ashton, though they remain publicly supportive of the coach.
1682	AFP_ENG_20071104.0430.LDC2009T13	Soon after arriving back in South Africa with the Webb Ellis trophy, White said: "England is probably one job most international coaches wouldn't mind taking because it's a power that can become a huge force.
1683	AFP_ENG_20071104.0430.LDC2009T13	They have a great rugby culture."

1686	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	Robert Rubin, named chairman of the world's biggest banking group Citigroup Sunday, is a former secretary of the US Treasury credited with boosting the United States' economy in the 1990s.
1687	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He was hailed as an economic hero by Time magazine, one of three influential economists credited with saving markets from the late-1990s Asian financial crash and setting Wall Street on top of the world.
1688	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	The other two were his Treasury successor Larry Summers and former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan.

1703	AFP_ENG_20071109.0162.LDC2009T13	The United States on Friday demanded that Pakistan's Pervez Musharraf grant freedom of movement to opposition leaders and end former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's house arrest.
1704	AFP_ENG_20071109.0162.LDC2009T13	"Former Prime Minister Bhutto and other political party members must be permitted freedom of movement and all protesters released," said US National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe.

1709	AFP_ENG_20071109.0162.LDC2009T13	Pakistan police blocked Bhutto from leaving her home, as she pleaded with them to free her to lead a rally against Musharraf's national state of emergency, which has drawn international condemnation.

1712	AFP_ENG_20071109.0162.LDC2009T13	My struggle is for the people of Pakistan, for their rights and for an end to dictatorship."

1722	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	Philippine merchandise exports rose 4.7 percent to 4.37 billion dollars in September from a year earlier despite a drop in the electronics sector, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said Friday.
1723	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	Shipments of electronics, which accounted for 60.7 percent of total exports in September, were down by 0.2 percent to 2.656 billion dollars compared to the same period last year, the NSO said in a statement.

1725	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	Export earnings in the first nine months of the year stood at 37.2 billion dollars, up 4.9 percent from the same period in 2006, the statement said.
1726	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	The strong performance was an improvement from August, when exports fell by four percent.
1727	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	The data showed the drop in electronics exports was offset by growth in other areas, said David Cohen, director of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.

1736	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The political future of controversial Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was uncertain Monday after the resignation of nine ministers.
1737	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The breakaway group, which includes deputy prime minister Toswell Kaua, have petitioned the Solomon Islands governor general to convene parliament for a vote of no-confidence in Sogavare's government.
1738	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The group claimed Sunday it has majority support in the 48-member parliament of the impoverished South Pacific nation of 500,000.
1739	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"We have 28 MPs including nine ministers and 17 opposition (legislators)," one of its leaders, former minister Gordon Darcy Lilo, told local reporters.
1740	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Other legislators who previously supported Sogavare are also believed to have switched sides and the breakaway group say they expect their numbers to swell further.
1741	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has been shrouded in controversy since coming to power in April last year after riots destroyed dozens of businesses owned by ethnic Chinese and forced the resignation of his unpopular predecessor Snyder Rini.
1742	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The prime minister put on a brave front, saying he was unconcerned about the moves.
1743	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	But he held out an olive branch, saying he was happy to talk to the defectors.
1744	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Most damaging for Sogavare is the defection of Kaua.
1745	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"Yes he is one of the ringleaders, his name is right on top of the list," Sogavare told reporters.
1746	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The split was prompted by the sacking last week of finance minister Lilo after he refused to comply with pressure to fire the board of troubled national carrier Solomon Airlines.
1747	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has accused Lilo of interfering in the operation of the national airline and on Sunday he told reporters Lilo had been implicated in corrupt practices including bribery.
1748	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Lilo rejected the allegations as "made up stories".
1749	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	He said the defectors had pulled out of the government because of concerns over the country's leadership, including Sogavare's decision to boycott the recent Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Tonga.
1750	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"If this country gets in trouble where will we run to?"
1751	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	said Lilo.
1752	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare stayed away from the meeting of leaders from 16 regional nations over his opposition to Australian dominance of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which is formally under the control of the forum.
1753	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has been in a long-running confrontation with Australia since he expelled the Australian ambassador last year and Canberra tried to extradite Solomons Attorney General Julian Moti on child sex charges.
1754	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The rebels said they would decide through consensus their candidate to take over as prime minister.

1762	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Japan's opposition said Monday the tide was turning against the ruling bloc after its candidate was voted mayor of Osaka in the first election under Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda.
1763	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition also said it was the wrong time to discuss key legislation that would enable Japan to resume its naval mission supporting the "war on terror," citing scandals which involve the defence ministry and the finance minister.
1764	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition-supported candidate ousted the incumbent backed by Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's election in Japan's second city after a campaign that drew senior national lawmakers from both sides.
1765	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was proof that voters in Osaka did not approve of the Fukuda administration and the administration supported by the Liberal Democratic Party," said Yukio Hatoyama, secretary general of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan.
1766	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"This symbolises nationwide politics," he said.
1767	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition won one house of parliament in July in a voter backlash against a raft of scandals under then prime minister Shinzo Abe.
1768	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Abe, an outspoken conservative, abruptly quit after the opposition refused his calls to extend a naval mission supporting the US-led "war on terror" in Afghanistan.
1769	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda, a 71-year-old centrist political veteran, took over in late September.
1770	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	He is in the midst of a battle with the opposition to restart the naval deployment.
1771	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	In a weekend summit in Washington, Fukuda promised US President George W. Bush to work to resume the mission, which provided fuel and other support on the Indian Ocean to the US-led coalition.
1772	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda's government downplayed the significance of the Osaka election.
1773	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was unfortunate that the candidate supported by the Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito lost," chief government spokesman Nobutaka Machimura said, referring to the LDP's coalition partner.
1774	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"But we are not analysing it at the level of national politics.
1775	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	I don't think this will affect politics at the national level," he said.
1776	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	In the election, Kunio Hiramatsu, a former television newscaster supported by the opposition, defeated the LDP-backed incumbent Junichi Seki, who was first elected in 2003.
1777	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The election was nominally non-partisan.
1778	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The election offers good news for the opposition after a tough month in which its leader Ichiro Ozawa offered to resign and then retracted it in a feud over whether to join Fukuda in a grand coalition.
1779	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition has also gone on the offensive over a growing scandal in which the recently retired top bureaucrat at the defence ministry acknowledged that a military contractor treated him to gifts, dinner and more than 200 golf trips.
1780	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition, which controls the upper house, reiterated that it would probe the scandal before taking up a bill on the naval mission.
1781	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda wants the military legislation to pass during the current parliament session that ends on December 15, but secretary general Hatoyama said "they can't realise that wish."

1860	AFP_ENG_20071207.0057.LDC2009T13	"We are investigating cases in Mbale (near the Kenyan border), where one man has died and in Masaka (near Lake Victoria), where two fishermen have symptoms similar to those of Ebola," he added.
1861	AFP_ENG_20071207.0057.LDC2009T13	The health ministry said teams were also probing cases in western Kanungu and Kasese districts and northwestern Adjuman district for possible Ebola infections.

1867	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The International Monetary Fund announced plans Friday to cut up to 15 percent of its staff in a wide-ranging overhaul aimed at shoring up finances at the multilateral economic institution.
1868	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In comments posted in an internal IMF magazine, the organization said the planned overhaul aimed at budget savings of around 100 million dollars annually and possible job losses of between 300 and 400 staff.
1869	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Such cuts could affect around 15 percent of the IMF's total headcount of 2,600.
1870	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	An IMF official, who requested anonymity, told AFP the job cuts would likely occur over three years starting on May 1, 2008.
1871	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The jobs losses, if implemented, would rank among the largest in the IMF's history.
1872	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Prior job cuts have been small by comparison involving considerably less than 100 employees.
1873	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister who took over the helm of the IMF in early November, said the fund does not face an immediate financing crisis, but that it cannot continue to rely on income from lending to guarantee its future.
1874	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Strauss-Kahn said the overhaul is key to refocusing the IMF's operations and his bid to introduce a new and stronger income model for the 185-country institution.
1875	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Without quickly reforming its operations and cutting jobs, the IMF could face a funding shortfall of 400 million dollars by 2010, the magazine article, which was posted on the IMF's website, warned.

1881	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The overhaul comes as the IMF faces challenges over its survival.
1882	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Many developing nations are growing rapidly and as a result have less need for IMF aid which is often granted with strict standards.
1883	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Friday, the straight- talking Kahn said: "This institution works well, with dedicated people and very high-level staff, but it is a factory to produce paper."
1884	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In the IMF magazine, the IMF chief was quoted as saying "the coming months will inevitably be a period of rapid change."

1886	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	Hamas political supremo Khaled Meshaal is holding talks with officials in Saudi Arabia, amid moves by the oil-rich kingdom to boost its role in securing peace across the Middle East, a source close to Meshaal said on Saturday.
1887	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	Meshaal arrived in Saudi Arabia late on Friday and is meeting officials in Riyadh, the aide told AFP, without giving further details.
1888	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia last February brokered a short-lived power sharing agreement between Hamas and rival faction Fatah, which is led by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
1889	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government after Hamas seized control of Gaza and has appointed a new cabinet based in the West Bank.
1890	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	He has since ruled out any dialogue with Hamas until it returns the strip to his authority.
1891	AFP_ENG_20071208.0274.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia, a principal patron of the Palestinians and an influential voice in the Muslim world, also played a key role in the US-hosted Middle East conference held last month that aimed to kickstart peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

1893	AFP_ENG_20071209.0012.LDC2009T13	Japan's core machinery orders, a key gauge of corporate capital spending, rose by 12.7 percent in October from the previous month, the government said Monday.
1894	AFP_ENG_20071209.0012.LDC2009T13	The rise reversed a 7.6 percent drop marked in September.

1896	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	Marathon talks on fighting climate change took a break early Saturday, with delegates saying they were hopeful for an agreement but that some issues remained undecided, officials said.
1897	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	"You can go to bed and come back to the plenary tomorrow morning," said Artur Runge-Metzger, a climate negotiator of the European Commission.
1898	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	A British official said: "The negotiations are ongoing.
1899	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	Nothing is in and nothing is out."
1900	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	Delegates said one key sticking point was a US-led call on developing countries to commit to slashing carbon emissions.
1901	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	"The US is demanding that developing countries make the same obligations as the industrialised countries," German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel said.
1902	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	"The developing countries are prepared to do more, but don't want to be put into the same category as the industrialised countries," he said.
1903	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	The United States is the only major industrial country to reject the Kyoto Protocol, with President George W. Bush arguing it is unfair by not making demands of fast-growing developing economies such as China, the second biggest emitter.
1904	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	Despite the disagreement, UN climate chief Yvo de Boer said earlier he was hopeful for a breakthrough as most of the difficult issues had been worked out.
1905	AFP_ENG_20071214.0109.LDC2009T13	The agreement is expected to make a general call for rich nations to slash emissions of carbon blamed for causing global warming, which a Nobel-winning panel of scientists predicts could devastate the world in decades to come.
1906	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Pilgrims pelt Satan on last day of Mecca hajj
1907	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The annual hajj in Saudi Arabia entered its final day on Friday as the last of almost 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims took part in the ritual "stoning of Satan."
1908	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Eager pilgrims who had travelled from across the world thronged around the Jamarat Bridge at Mina east of Mecca from the early hours to throw pebbles at the three massive pillars representing the devil.
1909	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	With cries of "Allahu Akbar" -- God is greater -- echoing around the valley, the vast multitude of hajjis completed the ritual as the ceremony began drawing to a close.
1910	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	People spoke of their joy at completing the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam which all Muslims must undertake once in a lifetime if they have the means to do so.
1911	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	"My husband is blind and we are both very old, but we are glad we're here though we have our disabilty to overcome," said Fozia from Pakistan as she led her elderly partner through the crowd.
1912	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Egyptian Zaynab, attending with her husband and child, added: "My child is very frightened by the noise and it is very dirty here, but this is an important hajj ritual because we have many tests to overcome."
1913	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	After throwing their pebbles at the pillars, pilgrims began returning to the Grand Mosque in Mecca before making their trip home.
1914	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	"It was a good release of anger and frustration, especially in our material world.
1915	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Temptations are many, you know," said Sami, a Canadian Muslim from Toronto performing the hajj with his wife.
1916	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of slippers lost during the ritual and empty drinking bottles used by the faithful to carry pebbles littered the three- storey bridge overlooking the pillars.
1917	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Security forces and medical staff stood by to guard against any repetition of tragedies that have marked the hajj in previous years.
1918	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	There have been no reported deaths or injuries caused by overcrowding at this year's celebrations, but thousands of people have lost their lives during previous pilgrimages, some in stampedes as pilgrims jostled and pushed to get close to Satan's pillars.
1919	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	In January 2006, 364 people were killed in a huge crush during the stoning ceremony, and a similar tragedy in 2004 saw 251 people trampled to death.
1920	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The worst incident was in 1990 when 1,426 people suffocated in a tunnel at Mina after a ventilation system broke down.
1921	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Saudi authorities have now added a third level to the bridge complex to ease the pressure, allowing more than 200,000 people an hour to cast stones at the pillars.
1922	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	According to official Saudi figures a total of 2,454,325 pilgrims from 181 nations, 1,707,814 of them from outside the kingdom, are performing this year's pilgrimage.
1923	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The pillars at Jamarat are traditionally believed to be the place where the devil appeared to Abraham, his wife Hagar and son Ishmael.
1924	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	This year Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first president of the Islamic republic to take part in the hajj after he was invited to attend by King Abdullah.
1925	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	His visit had an added political significance because of the sometimes rocky relations between Shiite Iran and Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia, both key players in the Middle East.
1926	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	European leaders celebrate fallen borders where Iron Curtain once stood
1927	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	EU, Slovenian and Hungarian dignitaries took part in a last round of celebrations Saturday to welcome nine mainly eastern European countries into the passport-free Schengen zone.
1928	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	A day after borders were lifted, making it now possible to travel from Estonia to Portugal without passport controls, top officials gathered in Skofije on the Italian-Slovenian border for a final ceremony that ended three days of festivities along the path of the former Iron Curtain.
1929	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	"Something is happening today that 15 years ago, we could not have even dreamt of: the physical borders are falling," Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said at the ceremony.
1930	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	He recalled: "Twenty years ago at this very border -- which was then still the border of Yugoslavia -- people were shot at if they tried to cross illegally."
1931	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	"That was Europe 20 years ago, Europe divided, a great part of Europe without access to freedom," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso added.
1932	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	"That is why I can't be pessimistic about the future (of the EU), when I see where we are now and where we come from."
1933	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	He noted that the lifting of the barriers was more than a symbolic or political gesture, and that it had "concrete meaning" for Europeans, allowing easier travel, improving relations between states and enhancing growth and employment.
1934	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Some older Schengen countries have voiced concern that the new members will not be able to ensure security and that eastern European criminals will descend en masse on Western Europe.
1935	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	But Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said: "We can assure you that yesterday's opening of the borders did not represent a drop of security, but an increase of freedom."
1936	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Slovenia, the first former Yugoslav state to join the European Union and the eurozone, will now control 760 kilometres (472 miles) of the Schengen border.
1937	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	But Jansa predicted that the passport-free zone would extend further still in the future: "The expansion of the Schengen area is not over yet," he said.
1938	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, noted meanwhile: "We celebrate the best of Europe, the best of European values, democracy, peace, freedom... Congratulations to Italy, Slovenia, and viva Europa!"
1939	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Symbolically handing over the six-month rotating EU presidency to Slovenia, he added: "I cannot imagine a better way to finish a presidency."
1940	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Earlier Saturday, Socrates had taken part in another ceremony at Hegyeshalom, on the Austro-Hungarian border near Slovakia, alongside Barroso, Hungarian premier Ferenc Gyurcsany, his Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico and Austrian Interior Minister Guenther Platter.
1941	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Despite the biting cold, the leaders were all smiles as they posed in front of a sign proclaiming a "borderless Europe" in several languages, and Gyurcsany declared: "We are prepared to defend and strengthen Europe as proud Hungarians."
1942	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	Platter added: "With the opening of the borders, we have overcome the partition of Europe.
1943	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	This is a great day for Austria, for all new Schengen states and most of all for Europe."
1944	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	The ceremony ended with the inauguration of a monument indicating the distances from Hegyeshalom to all European capitals.
1945	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	At midnight on Friday, nine new countries -- the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- joined the 15 nations already in the no-passport Schengen zone.
1946	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	European leaders hailed the entry of these mainly ex-communist states into Schengen as border posts were symbolically lifted or sawed through, less than 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
1947	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	A total of 400 million people from 24 countries will now be able to move freely throughout Europe.
1948	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	The old signatories of the 1985 Schengen Agreement included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.

1950	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Former Pakistan premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a stunning suicide attack Thursday that plunged the Muslim nation deeper into crisis and sparked alarm around the world.
1951	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks before general elections, a suicide bomber pierced her security cordon to shoot her in the neck as she left a campaign rally.
1952	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	He then blew himself up, killing at least 20 people, police and party officials said.
1953	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	The powerful blast tore off limbs and shredded clothes.
1954	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Many people ran in panic, screaming as they trampled over pieces of human flesh.
1955	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Puddles of blood dotted the road.
1956	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"There was an enormous explosion, and then I saw body parts flying through the air," said Mirza Fahin, a professor at a local college.
1957	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"When the dust cleared, I saw mutilated bodies lying in blood.
1958	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	I have never seen anything so horrible in my life -- just parts of human beings, flesh, lying in the road."
1959	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	The slaying horrified world leaders who appealed for calm and warned that extremists must not be allowed to destabilise the nuclear-armed nation before the January 8 vote.
1960	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush called it a "cowardly act" and telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf -- a crucial ally in the US-led "war on terror" against Islamic extremism -- to discuss the crisis.
1961	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Unrest broke out across Pakistan as mobs of protesters torched buildings, trucks and shops, blocked roads and uprooted rail tracks.
1962	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Two people were shot dead in rioting in the eastern city of Lahore and another two were killed in southern Sindh province.
1963	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Police and paramilitary forces were put on the highest "red alert" level.
1964	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Musharraf, who announced three days of national mourning, urged people to remain peaceful "so that the evil designs of terrorists can be defeated."
1965	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	But the attack raises questions about whether the election can go ahead, as well as speculation that Musharraf may re-impose the emergency rule he ended earlier this month.
1966	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Nawaz Sharif, another former premier and Bhutto's biggest political rival, said he would boycott the election and urged Musharraf to resign to "save" the country.
1967	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"I demand that Musharraf quit power, without delay of a single day, to save Pakistan," he told reporters, calling for a nationwide strike.
1968	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing, but Bhutto had previously accused elements in the intelligence services of trying to kill her and said she had also received death threats from Islamic militant groups including Al-Qaeda.
1969	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"The attacker fired and then blew himself up," said one police official who asked not to be named.
1970	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"She was waving to the crowd from the sunroof of her car and then there was a blast," Bhutto spokesman Farhatullah Babar told state television.
1971	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Bhutto, 54, became the first ever female prime minister of a Muslim nation when she took the helm in 1988 for the first of her two premierships.
1972	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Her father, also a prime minister, was hanged by the military in 1979 after being ousted from power.
1973	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Educated at Oxford and Harvard, Bhutto's return here in October after eight years of self-exile brought hopes of a power-sharing deal with Musharraf.
1974	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	That optimism was quickly shattered.
1975	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Her welcome home parade was hit in the deadliest terror attack in Pakistani history, killing 139 people, while her talks with Musharraf ended in acrimony after he declared emergency rule on November 3.
1976	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	As Bhutto's husband Asif Zardari flew in from Dubai, sources said that her funeral was likely to take place Friday in Larkana, her home town deep in the rural south.
1977	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	There were frenzied scenes as hundreds of people mobbed her simple wooden coffin as it was borne uneasily out of the hospital to a waiting ambulance for the journey to the airport.
1978	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	It had a piece of clear plastic or glass in the lid that allowed people to see her body, wrapped in a white shroud.
1979	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Bhutto's party successor and Zardari by telephone to press US support for the elections to go ahead, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
1980	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	World leaders swiftly condemned what neighbour India called an "abominable act."
1981	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"The US strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy," Bush told reporters.
1982	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon described it as a "heinous crime," and the UN Security Council condemned the "terrorist suicide attack" after meeting in emergency session to discuss the crisis.

2008	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Orphaned Bangladeshi conjoined twins have survived an initial operation, but it will be another six months before they can be separated, the Australian charity looking after them said Tuesday.
2009	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	One-year-old girls Trishna and Krishna are joined at the head but have separate brains.
2010	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	If the twins are not separated, they are expected to die.
2011	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Surgeons, who carried out the first surgical procedure last week, have assessed that they can be separated but it will be a difficult task.
2012	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	"They have had one stage of an operation.
2013	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	They have got to have six months of preparation before they can be separated," Margaret Smith, chief executive of the Children First Foundation, told AFP.
2014	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	"They are very beautiful little girls.
2015	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	They are quite normal.
2016	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	They just happen to be joined at the head."
2017	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	The children were brought to Australia late last year from Bangladesh, where they were living in an orphanage at an undisclosed location.
2018	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	According to the charity, they were orphaned at birth in December 2006.
2019	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	They are staying at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital, one of Australia's leading medical institutions for children, and will live at a rehabilitation centre in the countryside if successfully separated, while recovering from the surgery.
2020	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	According to reports, the veins which drain from the two girls' brains are joined, causing blood to flow from one child to the other.
2021	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	As a result, the smaller of the two is suffering heart failure already.
2022	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Wirginia Maixner, director of neurosurgery at the hospital, has told Melbourne's The Age newspaper the task ahead was "momentous" but separation was the only option.
2023	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	"A lot of these children with this problem die before they get to a major centre, so they've done well to survive to one year of age.
2024	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	But if one child dies they both die," Maixner told the newspaper.
2025	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	The girls require another three or four operations over the next six months, with the next scheduled for six weeks from now.
2026	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	The charity has raised 250,000 Australian dollars (225,000 US) to cover the basic medical costs, but is still seeking 150,000 dollars to cover ongoing care costs, of which Smith said 10,000 dollars has so far been raised.
2027	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the government would see if there was any way it could help, but warned it was unlikely as large numbers of Australians with surgical needs were unable to pay for them.

2029	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Bounding round a building site, questioning local officials and issuing the odd cutting reprimand, Dmitry Medvedev, the man tipped to be Russia's next leader, is sharpening his act ahead of a March 2 election.
2030	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	While there is no sign of serious competition in the polls, the Kremlin is hard at work turning this previously low profile bureaucrat into someone closer in style to his long-time supremely confident mentor, incumbent President Vladimir Putin.
2031	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	A visit this week to the oil-rich Tyumen region in western Siberia was the latest tightly choreographed opportunity for the 42-year-old former law professor to show he has what it takes to head the world's largest country.
2032	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	With television cameras carefully positioned along his route, Medvedev listened earnestly and interjected with questions as he toured a development of starter apartments being built for young families, complete with playgrounds and sports facilities.

2034	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	But critics charge that the opposition has been marginalised by biased media coverage and the use of state resources to promote the Kremlin's candidate.
2035	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	A few strains showed through on Wednesday's tour, as when two workmen admitted to nervousness while "painting" and "repainting" a ceiling.

2041	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Everything's alright."
2042	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Moscow has been working for some time on ensuring a seamless transition after eight years under Putin, who is however expected to retain power in a job as prime minister.
2043	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev currently holds the post of first deputy prime minister, in which he has been responsible for the touchstone issues of housing, health and education.
2044	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Since Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last month, Medvedev's tours around the country to inspect such projects and meet residents have stepped up.
2045	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Along the way he has toughened his speaking style and has even on occasion adopted Putin's habit of dressing all in black, a look that works to underline the current Russian leader's hard-man image.
2046	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev occasionally encounters complaints, such as when a building site worker told him of his worries about the cost of education and housing.
2047	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev responded that the state would maintain the current number of subsidised higher education places and urged the young man to work hard.
2048	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	At a meeting with regional governors he went on to emulate Putin's habit of reeling off statistics, taking copious notes, making cutting interjections and at one point rebuking an enthusiastic governor.
2049	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Only on February 2, one month before voting, is the election campaign to be officially declared open.

2060	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Members of Kenya's dominant Kikuyu tribe living in opposition strongholds feel they are paying the price for the tribal rhetoric that plagued last month's disputed elections.
2061	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's inhuman to ask somebody like me to go back to my 'real home land', I don't even know my real home land," said Nancy, a Kikuyu woman from the Eldoret area in western Kenya.
2062	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	The Kikuyus are the country's largest tribe but in a minority in western Kenya, where people overwhelmingly voted in the December 27 presidential election for opposition leader Raila Odinga, from the Luo tribe, who lost to incumbent President Kwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu.
2063	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Nancy, 47, said she had no intention of leaving the area where her family has lived for more than three generations to move to the Kikuyu heartland, in central Kenya.
2064	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"I'm not going anywhere, I was born here.
2065	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	My family came in the 1930s, they bought a piece of land, I have no relatives anywhere else," she explained.
2066	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	When Kibaki was declared the winner of the election on December 30 despite mounting evidence of fraud, several tribes turned against the Kikuyus.
2067	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Dozens were speared and hacked to death in raids on villages in the Eldoret area.
2068	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Refugees were also targeted, notably when a church in Eldoret housing displaced Kikuyu families was deliberately set on fire, killing at least 35 people.
2069	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Local residents and observers have argued that in regions where feelings of marginalisation were strongest, tribal vindication was encouraged by campaigns using the long obsolete term of "majimbo".
2070	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Majimbo -- a Kiswahili term which implies a form of federalism, decentralisation and devolution -- featured in Odinga's campaign, although it was never clearly defined.
2071	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Most of the attacks against Kikuyus in the Eldoret area were carried out by Kalenjin, one of the dominant tribes in the area, who squarely supported Odinga and are represented in parliament by his right-hand man William Ruto.
2072	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of the country's tribes rallied behind Odinga, amid resentment at Kibaki and his Kikuyu entourage, seen as an arrogant and corrupt elite.
2073	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Stephen, who was displaced by the deadly violence that followed the elections and now lives in a camp some 20 miles from Eldoret, said that majimbo was understood by some as a license for ethnic cleansing.
2074	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"They did not understand that the term majimbo means sharing of resources and power, brought to people on the ground," he said.
2075	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"According to them, it's cleaning and removing tribes from Kalenjin ancestral land," Stephen added, quivering because of the cold.
2076	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Kenya, a mosaic of at least 42 tribes, has been relatively spared the kind of ethnic strife that has plagued other countries in the region such as Rwanda and Burundi over the past decades.
2077	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of Eldoret's Kikuyus settled the fertile region after the 1963 independence, with the support of their leader and the country's first president Jomo Kenyatta.
2078	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	John, 44, who lives with 10,200 other people displaced by the violence in a tented camp in Eldoret, only two miles from his home, said the opposition politicians had a slogan: 'Kalenjins, with no other tribes remaining'.
2079	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's not what they told the media, which was 'equal distribution of national ressources'," added John, a nurse.
2080	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	But Reverend Maritim arap Rirei, from Eldoret's Anglican church, said that the ethnic dimension of the conflict only surfaced on the back of deeper underlying problems.
2081	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"We have been having a potential conflict for several years, just waiting for a spark," he said, adding: "In Kenya, we confuse calm and peace."
2082	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"Kikuyus are seen as the privileged in terms of access to resources and protection of the governement, and when there are problems, they become an easy target," he explained.

2103	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	However, the company warned that delays in its new 787 Dreamliner program would weigh on its earnings in 2008.
2104	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	For the full year 2007, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 5.28 dollars on higher commercial aircraft deliveries, strong growth in defense earnings, productivity gains and other factors, Boeing said.
2105	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	That compared with 2006 net profit of 2.2 billion dollars and 2.85 dollars earnings per share.
2106	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Boeing said that fourth-quarter net profit rose four percent to 1.03 billion dollars from the same period in 2006, with earnings per share at 1.36 dollars.

2112	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The prior forecast was for revenue of 67.5 billion dollars to 68.5 billion for the year.

2117	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The alleged British mastermind of a foiled coup in Equatorial Guinea has been deported there from Zimbabwe, even though he was still appealing against his extradition, court documents showed on Friday.
2118	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Simon Mann, an ex-SAS officer was placed on a military plane and flown out in the early hours of Thursday after being handed over to Equatorial Guinea officials, a senior immigration officer said in an affadavit seen by AFP.

2120	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	But Mann's lawyer Jonathan Samkange said he had only learnt his client had already been flown out when he lodged legal papers on Friday relating to a final appeal against his deportation.
2121	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The idea was that by the time we filed a notice of appeal he would have gone.
2122	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	This was designed to defeat the notice of our appeal," Samkange told AFP.
2123	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"Deporting a person at night is not only mischievous but unlawful."
2124	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann had lost a bid for freedom earlier this week when a high court judge upheld an earlier ruling by magistrates but he was still pinning his hopes on a final appeal before the supreme court.
2125	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The lawyer had turned up at court on Friday morning to file the appeal papers when he was shown documents confirming the deportation order had been already carried out at the behest of acting attorney general Bharat Patel.
2126	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Patel was also one of the judges at the high court ruling.
2127	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Samkange said the authorities had deliberately concealed the fact Mann had been moved out of the Chikurubi maximum security prison, near Harare.

2129	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	An affadavit signed by principal immigration officer Evans Siziba and later lodged with the high court confirmed Mann had been flown out before dawn.

2132	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann was then taken to the nearby Manyame air base and handed over to the Equatorial Guinea authorities who had a plane already waiting on the tarmac.
2133	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"They boarded an air force plane which took off about 0450 hours," said Siziba.
2134	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann's legal team applied on Friday for a court order for their client to be returned to Zimbabwe but the application was rejected by a high court judge.
2135	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The application has been dismissed because Simon Mann was deported before the appeal was noted at the supreme court," Julia Woods, another of the Briton's lawyers, told AFP after the hearing.
2136	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	An alumnus of Britain's famous Eton school, Mann was arrested with 61 others when their plane landed at Harare international airport in March 2004.

2138	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann said he and his co-accused were on their way to the Democratic Republic of Congo and needed the weapons for a security contract at a mine.
2139	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	He was sentenced to seven years in jail, but the term was later reduced.

2145	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	New England safety Rodney Harrison will suit up for the Super Bowl less than a season after serving a drugs ban, but the National Football League says its anti-doping programme is on track.
2146	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that the league's drug programme was the "gold standard" in sports and pointed to a NFL partnership with the US Olympic Committee and baseball to develop a reliable, economical test for human growth hormone (HGH).
2147	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	Harrison, the only player in NFL history to have at least 30 sacks and 30 interceptions, was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 season for violating the NFL's policy on banned substances.
2148	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	It has been reported that Harrison used HGH, which is on the NFL banned list, but he has not confirmed what substance it was.
2149	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	Harrinson has said that it wasn't steroids and that he took it to help him overcome injuries.
2150	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	The player himself says he has learned from his mistake.
2151	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"My message to young kids was, 'You make a mistake.
2152	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	Own up to it,'" he said.
2153	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"The only way to make amends is to get better as a person.
2154	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"When I came back (from the suspension), I had a fire."
2155	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	Goodell said that he did not believe HGH use was rife in the league.
2156	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there is a significant amount of HGH use, but I have no factual basis for saying that," he said.
2157	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"I think our athletes are extremely well trained.
2158	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	I don't think they want HGH or performance-enhancing drugs in the game.
2159	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	I think that is why our drug programme has been so effective, and the gold standard in sports, because our union supports it."
2160	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	However, players' association chief Gene Upshaw warned Thursday that the union would not support regular testing for HGH via blood test.
2161	AFP_ENG_20080202.0479.LDC2009T13	"Most of our players, as big and tough as they are, don't want to be stuck like a pin cushion," Upshaw said.

2164	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	The withdrawal left a consortium led by Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson and a group from Northern Rock's own management as the only parties expected to make offers.

2179	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Mike Huckabee may still be a long shot in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, but his weekend victories in Kansas and Louisiana proved he is likely to be a thorn in the side of frontrunner John McCain for some time to come.
2180	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Despite McCain's solid lead in the battle for delegates to the Republican nominating convention, which analysts call nearly impossible to overcome, Huckabee insisted Sunday he was going to fight all the way to the wire.
2181	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it needs unity against the powerful Democrats.
2182	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"When I hear people say it's practically impossible, nothing is impossible," the former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher told CBS television Sunday when asked about his chances.
2183	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"This country was built on the impossible.
2184	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And it's impossible that I'm still in the race.
2185	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That's what most people would have said a few months ago."
2186	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Showing the force of his evangelical Christian base, Huckabee trounced McCain on Saturday in Kansas's caucuses, winning 60 percent support against the Arizona senator's 20 percent.
2187	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	In Louisiana, Huckabee squeaked out a narrow win, 43 percent to 42 percent.
2188	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he narrowly lost the Washington state caucus, which voted 26 percent for McCain, 24 percent for Huckabee.
2189	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He said Sunday however that he would launch a challenge to the Washington State caucus results, complaining that far too few of votes were counted when the election was called in McCain's favor.
2190	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he rejected calls for to pull out of the race.
2191	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"The fact they're blowing against me hardly motivates me to quit," he told reporters in Washington.
2192	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"It motivates me to play harder.
2193	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	If they think they're getting a chorus of voices that will make me say okay, it's time to leave, they don't know me very well."
2194	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee remains way behind McCain in the crucial delegate count, with just 234 to McCain's 724 -- out of 1,191 needed to clinch the nomination -- according to poll-tracker RealClearPolitics.com.
2195	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But he refused to concede any inevitability Sunday.
2196	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm prepared to stay in until somebody has 1,191 delegates because that's the magic number at which a person is the nominee of the party," Huckabee insisted on CBS.
2197	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"People in many, many states, including large states like Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and all across this country, Nebraska, North Carolina -- they've not even voted," he said.
2198	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"So are we to tell them, 'Forget your vote
2199	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	we don't even care what you think?"
2200	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee's success has come on the back of the party's conservatives, who have made well-known their disgust with McCain, branding him a "closet liberal."
2201	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Christian conservatives have especially latched onto Huckabee's religious values and opposition to abortion.
2202	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I do think (McCain) has got some challenges with not just the evangelicals, but frankly the economic conservatives, because of his opposition to the (President George W.) Bush tax cuts," Huckabee said on NBC.
2203	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	McCain's views on immigration "were way out of the mainstream and quite unorthodox.
2204	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He has been often the voice in the wilderness," he added.
2205	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee also argues that his experience as a state governor and his stance for a radical reform of the US tax system would make him a better president.
2206	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I've actually run a government," he told CBS.
2207	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think senators have the luxury of taking several issues, maybe two or three, and they can specialize in them."
2208	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"But in terms of seeing the whole playing field, they've never managed the whole field."
2209	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Huckabee's refusal to pull out of the race -- as did Mitt Romney on Thursday -- could deepen the party division between conservatives and Republicans ready to back McCain because he stands the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in November.
2210	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But the conservatives are also said to hope their resistance to McCain could push him to adopt more of their positions, like an absolute opposition to abortion and a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
2211	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	One widely-reported scenario has Huckabee accepting to be McCain's vice presidential running mate in the election.
2212	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But Huckabee insisted he was not planning to run with McCain -- as president or vice president.
2213	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I don't think Senator McCain would select me anyway.
2214	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	I'm not sure I would select him," he said.
2215	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"There are no discussions for such a thing because, at this point, I'm still running for president.
2216	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	There's no other reason for me to think otherwise."

2220	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	The French-Belgian bank Dexia, which specialises in financing local authorities, reported a 7.9-percent fall in net profit on Friday but said it had been little affected by the US home-loan subprime crisis.
2221	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia, saying it could benefit from new conditions on troubled markets, reported a net profit of 2.533 billion euros (3.85 billion dollars).
2222	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	This was more than the figure of 2.296 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Thomson Financial.
2223	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Chief executive Axel Miller said: "The financial crisis has created a new environment from which only banks with an optimal level of liquidity, asset quality and capital will be able to draw benefit.
2224	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	"In view of these results and events in 2007, Dexia is showing that it is one of these banks."
2225	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia forecast average annual dividend growth of 10.0 percent and said it was recommending a 12.3-percent rise in the dividend for 2007 to 91 cents per share.
2226	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Sales fell by 1.6 percent to 6.896 billion euros, which was slightly more than forecast by analysts.
2227	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	But in the fourth quarter of the year, net profit fell by 25.3 percent to 587 million euros and sales by 10.0 percent to 1.695 billion euros.
2228	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia said that the results demonstrated its financial strength and said: "The subprime mortgage crisis (in the United States) and in the financial sector has not had a significant impact on the quality of the group's assets."
2229	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	It added that it had steered clear of the collateralised debt market at the root of the subprime crisis and that "the credit risk arising from subprime mortgage loans does not particularly worry Dexia."
2230	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Many banks have had to write off billions of dollars from their assets because they were exposed through securitised debt to a collapse of the US subprime market.
2231	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	However, Dexia said that some of its assets had lost value in connection with its subsidiary FSA involved in underwriting debt, and that its treasury activities and activity on financial markets had also had some setbacks.
2232	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	For these asset reductions it gave a figure of 75 million euros in the fourth quarter, but said that this was a purely book- keeping figure because the assets remained fundamentally sound and would recover.
2233	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Financial Security Assurance (FSA) had also announced on February 22 that it had written down its portfolio of assets by 418 million dollars.
2234	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia said that further writedowns might become necessary for the first quarter of this year.

2245	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Japan's opposition is quietly stepping back from calls on the defence chief to step down over a naval accident that killed two fishermen, whose colleagues Thursday lent support to the minister.
2246	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Japan's largest and newest destroyer, equipped with the advanced Aegis radar combat system, rammed the fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean.
2247	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Two fishermen, a father and his adult son, are presumed dead in the collision last month, which has led to a fall in the support ratings for Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's government.
2248	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	The opposition last week demanded fresh elections and pledged to stall proceedings unless Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba quit or was fired in what would be the first departure from Fukuda's five-month-old government.
2249	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	While publicly the opposition has not changed stance, its calls for Ishiba's head have cooled this week, which media reports attributed to a request from the victims' family.
2250	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"The local fishermen's union has been consistently saying that Minister Ishiba wouldn't be able to take responsibility just by resigning the position," a fisherman in the victims' village of Katsuura told AFP.
2251	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"He has to take responsibility by clarifying what caused the accident and taking thorough preventive measures," he said, declining to be named.
2252	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Fukuda and Ishiba both visited the village, with the premier offering a tearful apology to Sachiko Kichisei, whose husband and son are both presumed dead.

2254	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"I don't know what exactly the letter said, but I'm sure it was along the lines of the feelings that we all share," the fisherman said.
2255	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Until last week, Japanese news reports had been filled with anonymous quotes from ruling party lawmakers saying it was only a matter of time before Ishiba would be forced out.
2256	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	But on Wednesday the Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted a senior official of the main opposition Democratic Party saying: "We won't be able to get public support for demanding him to resign under the current circumstances."

2259	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	Disgraced Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, who passed nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya, has returned home from hospital after a suspected infection, state media said Sunday.
2260	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, underwent cancer surgery in September 2006 and was hospitalised on Wednesday after he complained of fever and low blood pressure.
2261	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	"Dr Khan was shifted to his residence after gaining significant improvement in his health," the official Associated Press of Pakistan said quoting unnamed sources.
2262	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	"Further treatment as required would be provided to Dr Khan at his residence," the sources told APP.
2263	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	An army statement Wednesday said Khan had been in good health since he was diagnosed with prostate cancer but that on Tuesday "he complained of weakness and was provided immediate medical treatment at home."
2264	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	Khan fell from grace after he publicly confessed in February 2004 to proliferating nuclear secrets.
2265	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	He was immediately pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf.
2266	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	But while not officially under detention, Khan has since been forbidden from leaving his house in an upscale area of the capital Islamabad.
2267	AFP_ENG_20080309.0384.LDC2009T13	Musharraf has refused to allow international investigators to question Khan on the extent of his proliferation activities, saying that Pakistani authorities are capable of the task.

2271	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	Heavily armed rebels crossed into eastern Chad from Sudan on Wednesday, the government said Thursday, a month after a failed rebel attempt to overthrow President Idriss Deby Itno's regime.
2272	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	"Sudan on Wednesday launched several heavily armed (rebel) columns against Chad.
2273	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	These mercenaries crossed the border in the area of Moudeina," north of the border town of Ade, it said on national radio.
2274	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	Deby, whose regime accuses Khartoum of supporting Chadian rebels, was in Senegal's capital Dakar on Thursday where he was to sign a peace accord later in the day with Sudanese President Omar al- Beshir.
2275	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The two leaders are in Dakar this week for a summit of Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
2276	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The infiltration would be repeat of an incursion that saw rebel columns in pick- up trucks ride into N'Djamena on February 2 and 3 to overthrow Deby, who took shelter in his palace as street fighting raged.

2278	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	The United States raised doubts about whether Iranians had a "full menu of political choices" in Friday's parliamentary elections, but declined to pronounce them unfair.
2279	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"I don't know anything about turnout," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters when asked to comment on the elections and voter turnout.
2280	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"One thing I'd note though is the fact that the government had a heavy hand in deciding who could and could not run raises some questions about whether or not the Iranian people had a full menu of political choices available to them in this election," McCormack said.
2281	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"Then again that is not something that is new.
2282	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	There have been plenty of past instances in Iran where the government has summarily scratched names of potential candidates off the list, telling them they couldn't run for office."
2283	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Ahead of the vote, Iranian reformists have expressed fury that hundreds of their candidates were disqualified in vetting for the polls while conservatives have accused leading moderates of being too close to the West.
2284	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Asked whether he could rule out any chance that the elections would be fair, McCormack replied: "I guess we'll have to wait for input from my other colleagues before I have something more to stay about it."
2285	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday the administration had "very low expectations" for the elections, saying the results were unlikely to reflect the people's will.
2286	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	She spoke after Iran's leaders urged voters to send a defiant message to the West by participating massively in Friday's elections after a muted campaign expected to consolidate hardline control of parliament.
2287	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Iran's leadership has been keen to minimize political divisions and make a show of national unity amid the tensions over the Iranian atomic drive, which Washington charges is an unacknowledged effort to develop nuclear weapons.
2288	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Last week the UN Security Council tightened sanctions against Tehran over its refusal to heed the world body's calls to freeze uranium enrichment, a potential weapons-making process.
2289	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Iran analyst Karim Sadjadpour told AFP the latest resolution's "goal was to send a signal to Iranian voters" on Friday to chose "more pragmatic and moderate officials" who can end Iran's isolation and economic malaise.
2290	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey appeared to say as much last week, though he did not actually mention the elections.
2291	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"I would hold to you that there are political consequences in that system for that failure, that fundamental failure of President Ahmedinejad and his (group) to live up to that basic commitment that they made to their people when they were elected," Casey said.

2293	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	Kenya's tourism will turn to China and seek to develop its domestic market to inject new life in a sector battered by recent post-election violence, tourism officials said Thursday.
2294	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"China is an important market, a new market and a growing one," said Rebecca Nabutola, permanent secretary at the ministry of tourism and wildlife.
2295	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	More than 18,700 Chinese tourists visited the East African nation in 2007, up 27 percent from the number of arrivals recorded in 2006, she said at a press conference.
2296	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	While flights from Kenya's traditional tourism markets -- notably in Europe -- were halted or reduced following the eruption of post-election strife in late December, China did not issue travel advisories.
2297	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"We're not going to China in an attempt to rebuild our image... it was never really dented and tourist behaviour was not really affected," said Nabutola, part of a delegation heading to China next week to boost tourism.
2298	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	Tourism is the top foreign currency earning sector in Kenya and suffered from the worldwide attention attracted by the electoral dispute and ensuing cycle of tribal violence and revenge killings.
2299	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With a fast-growing middle-class, China -- the world's most populated country and its fourth largest economy -- is a coveted market for all top tourist destinations.
2300	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"There's also a lot of potential and a lot of interest that has come from India," the ministry official said.
2301	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With cancellations from overseas tourists hitting around 90 percent in January, the ministry has launched a recovery programme which will also involve the development of domestic tourism.
2302	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"If we want a sustainable tourism sector, we need a solid domestic base," Nabutola said.
2303	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	The domestic market currently accounts for only 25 percent of the sector's revenue, a figure she said Kenya hoped to double.

2305	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	No one should doubt Australian Grant Hackett's ability to claim his third Olympic gold medal in the 1500-metres freestyle at this year's Beijing Games, head coach Alan Thompson said Thursday.
2306	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	Heading into this weekend's Olympic trials here, Thompson said the world record holder has come a long way since last year's world championships when he struggled home in seventh place in the 1500m.
2307	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	Poland's Mateusz Sawrymowicz ended Hackett's four-title world domination of the 1500m at the worlds and South Korean Park Tae- Hwan completed Hackett's misery by upsetting the defending champion in the 400m freestyle.
2308	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people in Australia wondered whether Grant would continue on swimming after the world championships last year, or whether he could get back to his best," Thompson told a press conference here ahead of Saturday's Olympic trials.
2309	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"I would suggest, though, we'll be waiting for the Olympic Games to see Grant at his absolute, absolute best, but he may surprise us all again."
2310	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	Off the back of solid performances in Europe and a win in the 1500m at the Japan Open, Thompson said Hackett looked set to perform well over the next week at the trials.
2311	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"I don't think we should ever doubt a champion like Grant," he said.
2312	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"He's certainly of great value to our team.
2313	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"As the team captain he may only talk to the team once or maybe twice... but what he does in the pool is something that is very important to our team and he's a great leader without standing up and talking about it, and just leading by his example.
2314	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"(At the world championships in Melbourne) I don't think his performances affected our team in a negative way.
2315	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	I think a lot of people felt for him, but when Grant performs very well they certainly affect our team in a very positive way."
2316	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	Hackett, who holds the 1500m world record at 14:34.56, set at the 2001 Fukuoka world championships, is scheduled to hold a pre-meet press conference on Friday.

2356	AFP_ENG_20080327.0122.LDC2009T13	Two US government employees have been killed and four others seriously wounded in a wave of rocket attacks this week against the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, officials said Thursday.
2357	AFP_ENG_20080327.0122.LDC2009T13	One US government employee was killed in the latest attack on Thursday and another died Monday after having been hurt seriously during a rocket strike on Sunday, State Department officials said.
2358	AFP_ENG_20080327.0122.LDC2009T13	"One US government employee, a US citizen, was killed in the latest round of indirect fire into the International (Green) Zone," according to a statement from Julie Reside, a State Department spokeswoman.

2363	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Football: Unstoppable Ronaldo keeps United on a roll
2364	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Cristiano Ronaldo continued his outstanding campaign with a goal and three assists as Manchester United cruised to victory over Aston Villa to open up a six-point gap at the head of the Premier League.
2365	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Wayne Rooney, twice, and Carlos Tevez were the players to benefit from the winger's service in a game that confirmed the scale of the task facing Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to overhaul the reigning champions.
2366	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	This was the perfect response to Arsenal's impressively resilient victory at Bolton earlier in the day that appeared to revive the London club title claims.
2367	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That win meant United kicked off just three points ahead of Arsene Wenger's side and, with Chelsea set to face Middlesbrough the following day, anything less than three points would have given the three-way battle at the head of the table a new twist.
2368	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	As it was Ferguson's side didn't just get the job done, they triumphed in a style that will undoubtedly suggested there is little chance of them throwing away such a commanding lead at this stage of the season.
2369	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	So comfortable was this win that Ferguson could afford to make three substitutions early in the second half when his side was already leading 3-0 to ensure fresh legs for the trip to face Roma in the Champions League quarter- final first leg in the Italian capital on Tuesday.
2370	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
2371	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But from the moment Ronaldo produced an impudent back-heel flick from ten yards out to divert the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and beyond Scott Carson for the 17th minute opener, United were almost completely in control.
2372	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed home.
2373	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Villa already looked a beaten side but they did at least rally after half-time, applying a brief period of pressure and, after Rooney had missed a sitter at the other end, should have scored when substitute Shaun Maloney pulled the ball wide when clear on Tomasz Kuzsczak's goal.
2374	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
2375	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60 seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.
2376	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	And the England striker claimed his second, again courtesy of his in-form team- mate, when he collected Ronaldo's neat reverse pass and finished from close range.
2377	AFP_ENG_20080401.0413.LDC2009T13	Kabila to visit South Africa to discuss closer links
2378	AFP_ENG_20080401.0413.LDC2009T13	DR Congo President Joseph Kabila is to visit South Africa on Thursday to meet President Thabo Mbeki and explore further links between the two countries, the government announced.

2402	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance chiefs warned on Friday that the 15-nation bloc faced growing risks to economic growth and inflation, but insisted there was currently no threat of a recession.
2403	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"Headwinds are materialising for growth," Luxembourg Finance Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said after chairing a meeting with his eurozone counterparts, also describing the bloc's economic performance as "satisfying."
2404	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"There has been a cyclical slowdown but not worse than that and certainly no prospect of recession," he told reporters in Brdo pri Kranju, Slovenia, near Ljubljana.
2405	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The US and the eurozone are certainly different in that respect."
2406	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also acknowledged that "downside risks have increased" since he forecast in February that the eurozone economy would grow 1.8 percent this year.
2407	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Almunia said eurozone finance ministers expected a "better scenario" than the International Monetary Fund's recently reduced forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year in the bloc.
2408	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	He blamed the bleaker outlook on the current financial crisis, which he said was lasting longer than previously expected.
2409	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The longer these tensions will be maintained the greater the risks are the financial market turmoil will be transmitted to the real economy," he said.
2410	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"We are receiving some negative impacts in our economies."
2411	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck saw no quick fix for the turmoil in the financial sector, he also warned against overreacting as he arrived for the meeting.
2412	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"It's going to keep us busy throughout 2008, but I advise against getting hysterical about it," he said.
2413	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance ministers, who were to be joined later by counterparts from all EU countries for a two-day meeting, are struggling to come up with concrete responses to the growing threats hovering over their economy.
2414	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Though under pressure to try to counter the financial crisis, deep divisions on the best strategy have so far kept the European finance ministers from taking concerted action.
2415	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Huge new write-downs this week by Swiss bank UBS and Deutsche Bank of Germany added to the sense of urgency ahead of the meeting of EU finance ministers and central bankers in Slovenia, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
2416	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	While the outlook for economic growth was falling, Almunia said inflation was rising and would probably top the 2.6 percent he forecast for 2008 in February.
2417	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although eurozone finance ministers were "concerned" but not "on the pessimistic side" regarding economic growth, Almunia said "we are extremely concerned on the inflation side."
2418	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Inflation in the 15 eurozone countries jumped in March to 3.5 percent -- the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999, according to official EU data earlier this week.
2419	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk warned that the currently high inflation looked increasingly like it was not a temporary uptick but was here to stay for some time.
2420	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development," he said.
2421	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although the euro's record strength helps limit the cost of dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil, it is also weighing on exports from the eurozone.
2422	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	As a result, the bloc's finance chiefs are edgy about spikes in the euro's exchange rate.
2423	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"Excessive volatility is counterproductive from the standpoint of global growth," ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said.
2424	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The recent excessive moves are an element of concern."

2457	AFP_ENG_20080415.0196.LDC2009T13	Egypt said on Sunday it would step up airport security procedures for British officials after airport authorities tried to physically search Shenuda, 84, who has a diplomatic passport, before he boarded his flight.

2464	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The increase in food prices is leading not only to empty stomachs but also empty classrooms in poor countries as parents send their children to work rather than school, UNICEF warned on Tuesday.The higher prices are making families "reduce their budget, to cut down on education and to remove their children from school to make them work" said Veronique Taveau, spokeswoman for the UN children's agency.
2465	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	She added that the organisation was "extremely concerned" by the price increases.
2466	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The impact of higher food prices is particularly marked in poor countries where 75 percent of a family's revenues go on food, compared to rich countries where just 15 percent of a household's income is spent on meals.
2467	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	A drop in school attendance is already being observed in Nepal, said World Food Programme spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume.
2468	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The country is particularly vulnerable as it depends on food imports from China and India, which are restricting exports, said Berthiaume.
2469	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	In many countries, the only warm meal children get in a day is the meal served in school canteens, she added.
2470	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	In Cambodia, the WFP was also forced to suspend its food distribution to school canteens as its local suppliers decided to drop their contracts with the group.

2485	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Iraqi troops were in a tense standoff with radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al- Sadr's supporters on Friday after they surrounded an office block occupied by the group in the southern city of Basra.The move was blasted by Sadr's supporters as a "provocation" but the Iraqi government said the operation only aimed to recover offices unfairly occupied by political groups.
2486	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	The incident comes only weeks after bloody fighting broke out on March 25 between Iraqi forces and Sadr's Mahdi Army militia when Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki launched a crackdown on Shiite militiamen in the port city.

2505	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	You are creating hatred and negative feelings," Shanshal told AFP during a visit to Sadr City on Friday.
2506	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Sadr City has been a site of violent clashes between Shiite militiamen, mostly from Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, and Iraqi and US forces, since March 25 when Maliki ordered a crackdown in Basra.

2521	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	China reacted angrily Tuesday to a meeting between a senior US official and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, urging Washington to "stop indulging" the Nobel Peace Prize winner.The Dalai Lama on Monday met US special envoy on Tibet Paula Dobriansky in the US state of Michigan, where he told her his homeland needed the help of the United States.
2522	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	Foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China had complained directly to the United States about the meeting.
2523	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	"This official ... deliberately ignored China's resolute opposition and persisted in meeting with the Dalai (Lama)," Jiang told reporters in Beijing.
2524	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	"We urge the US side to respect facts and stop indulging the Dalai clique in its separatist activities so as not to harm our bilateral relations and the image of the US itself," she added.
2525	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	During the Monday talks, the Dalai Lama asked Washington for help in improving the situation in Tibet, in the highest-level meeting with the US administration since Beijing began a crackdown on unrest in the Himalayan region.
2526	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	Protests against Chinese rule rocked Tibet last month.

2528	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	China's clampdown has triggered international outrage, with major protests disrupting the Beijing Olympic torch relay in London and Paris.
2529	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	It was Dobriansky's 12th meeting with the Dalai Lama aimed at finding a way to resolve the Tibet issue amicably, the US State Department said.
2530	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	"At this moment we need your help," the Dalai Lama told Dobriansky, adding that the Tibet issue was "very significant."
2531	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	Dobriansky, undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs, reiterated a US appeal for dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, saying the Bush administration "has expressed concern and has urged restraint" in Tibet.
2532	AFP_ENG_20080422.0407.LDC2009T13	China has insisted the unrest in Tibet is an attempt by the Dalai Lama to sabotage the August Beijing Olympics, and Jiang criticised the United States for failing to condemn him for his alleged role in the troubles.

2565	AFP_ENG_20080425.0363.LDC2009T13	President Vladimir Putin on Friday told a top European human rights representative just back from Chechnya that Russia took criticism of its rights record seriously.

2574	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
2575	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather, died of cancer in August 2006.
2576	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was always going to be a difficult hurdle for me to get back into the winner's enclosure after Heather passed away... It's a big mental hurdle that I have crossed today," the 39-year-old said.
2577	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as his thoughts drifted to his family.

2581	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
2582	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said it was the most important victory of his career as it cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.
2583	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes there's a black hole.
2584	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's not easy to see through," Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has endured since his wife died.
2585	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	In that respect, Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons, aged nine and seven.

2587	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke, who for many years had been a mainstay in Europe's Ryder Cup team, had watched his world ranking plummet out of the top 50 to 236 at the start of the BMW Asian Open.
2588	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said his win on Sunday was the result of practising 10-12 hours a day.

2594	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I lost my concentration.
2595	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I started thinking about Heather and the boys and bits and pieces," Clarke said.
2596	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"In this game, unless you keep your concentration for the whole way around, you make mistakes and that's what I did."
2597	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	On the 18th, Derksen chipped his third shot to within two feet to be almost assured of a par.
2598	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	That left Clarke with his putt of nearly 30 feet to win the tournament or face going into a playoff with Derksen.
2599	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"On the last green I gathered myself and said: 'Right, hit a good putt'.
2600	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Luckily I did," a beaming Clarke said.
2601	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Derksen paid tribute to Clarke afterwards.
2602	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Darren doled a good putt and that's his day," said Derksen, who was bidding for his third win on the European Tour.

2606	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The European Commission sharply raised its 2008 inflation estimate for the eurozone to 3.2 percent while trimming back only slightly its growth forecast to 1.7 percent.In February, the European Union's executive arm had forecast that inflation in the 15 nations sharing the euro would reach 2.6 percent this year and that growth would be 1.8 percent.
2607	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While record oil and food prices were taking their toll on growth and inflation, financial market turmoil and a US slump were proving to be worse than previously expected, the commission said in its spring Economic Forecast.
2608	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	In the 27-nation European Union, the commission forecast inflation would reach 3.6 percent this year, instead of the 2.9 percent previously expected, but stuck to its estimate for 2.0 percent economic growth.
2609	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	"Economic growth is moderating in the EU and euro area and the current, imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
2610	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The commission predicted that consumer prices growth would peak in the second quarter and cool down over the remainder of the year and into 2009, bringing inflation in the eurozone down to 2.2 percent next year.
2611	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Driven ever higher by record commodities prices, 12-month eurozone inflation hit 3.6 percent in March, the highest since the 1999 launch of the shared currency and well above the European Central Bank's comfort level of just under 2.0 percent.
2612	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While oil prices flirt with records close to 120 dollars a barrel, the EU executive said futures contracts suggested food prices would rise 54 percent in the first half of 2008 before stabilising.
2613	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, not all was doom and gloom in the commission's report with regional economic powerhouse Germany expected to perform better than the last time Brussels made forecasts in February.
2614	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Europe's biggest economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent this year, rather than the 1.6 percent the commission predicted in February.
2615	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, forecasts for some of Europe's other big economies were pared down with the French economy estimated to grow 1.6 percent in 2008 instead of 1.7 percent, and Italian growth cut to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent previously.
2616	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead to 2009, the commission predicted that economic activity would pick up towards the end of the year to about 2.0 percent in the eurozone at an annualised rate.
2617	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, for the whole of 2009, it forecast eurozone growth would slow to 1.5 percent while activity in the overall EU economy would ease to 1.8 percent.

2629	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Local authorities in eastern China tried to cover up an outbreak of a highly contagious virus that has killed 20 children and left more than 1,500 others ill, Chinese press reports said Tuesday.The China Youth Daily, the official organ of the Communist Youth League, compared the situation in Anhui province to the cover-up by Chinese officials of the SARS crisis in 2003.
2630	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"SARS has already taught us the lesson that local officials who neglected their duties, gave false reports... were punished," it said in a report on the Anhui problems.
2631	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	The first reports of the outbreak of the intestinal virus known as enterovirus 71, or EV71, emerged on Monday, with local Chinese officials quoted as saying 19 children had died and nearly 800 had been infected in Anhui.
2632	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	By Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency said the death toll had risen to 20 with another 1,520 children infected.
2633	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All those infected were reportedly below the age of six, with the majority of them just two years old.
2634	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All kindergartens in the city were closed on Tuesday, Xinhua said, as authorities scrambled to contain the virus nearly two months after the first signs of potential major problems.
2635	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Hospitals in Fuyang city in Anhui started to admit children in early March with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers or rashes on their hands and feet, all symptoms of the virus, Xinhua said.
2636	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	EV71, which causes hand, foot and mouth disease, is very contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or faeces of an infected person.
2637	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Young children are most susceptible because of lower immune systems.
2638	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	However Xinhua quoted an infectious disease specialist as saying that there was no need for panic with the latest outbreak, and that most of the children would recover.
2639	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"An overwhelming majority of the patients are curable," said Li Xingwang, who is in charge of the expert panel for prevention and treatment of the virus.
2640	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"Most of the children could recover after a week's treatment."
2641	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	In its article, the China Youth Daily said that far scarier than the actual epidemic was the local government's initial denial of rumours about the disease.
2642	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"When the terrifying virus had already infected more than 10 unrelated children, the local government denied the rumour," it said.
2643	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	A local official denied there was any cover-up at his level, saying the incident had been reported to higher authorities.
2644	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"The media criticism is wrong, because we reported to our superiors in time and according to regulations," Wan Junfeng, vice director of the Fuyang centre for disease control, told AFP.
2645	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"This is a new case, time is needed to find out the cause and what virus it is.
2646	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	And we can only make it public when we are ordered to."
2647	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Another newspaper on Tuesday raised cover-up allegations, referring to a similar incident in the same city four years ago, when authorities sought to hide a scandal over low-quality milk powder that killed at least 12 babies.
2648	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"What have Fuyang officials amended in the past four years?"
2649	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	a comment piece in the Beijing News asked.
2650	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"Just four years on, a tragedy with almost the same plot happens in the same place, and the 'cover-up' methods used by the local government at the beginning of the incident remain the same."
2651	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	China was widely criticised internationally for its initial cover-up of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in 2003.
2652	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	It appeared to have originated in southern China, then spread globally to infect more than 8,000 people and kill around 800 worldwide, including 349 in China.

2654	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The head of Italy's anti-immigration Northern League, flush from a strong showing in elections two weeks ago, on Wednesday urged a review of the Schengen treaty allowing free circulation in 22 EU member states.
2655	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"There are things to negotiate," Umberto Bossi told lawmakers, according to the ANSA news agency.
2656	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"We should review Schengen because we cannot go on like this," he added, without elaborating.
2657	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	EU members can travel freely in the Schengen zone, which includes 22 of the bloc's 27 member states.
2658	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, another Northern League stalwart, former reforms minister Roberto Calderoli, said "allowing free circulation to new members like Romania was a mistake."
2659	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the weekly Gente, Calderoli said: "The Schengen treaty was for European countries that were socio- economically homogeneous, which the new members are not.
2660	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	Inevitably, the poorest sections of these populations spread west, increasing petty crime."
2661	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The mid-April elections marked a breakthrough for the Northern League, which nearly doubled its strength in parliament with more than eight percent of the vote, prompting fears that the small anti-immigration party would unduly influence prime minister- elect Silvio Berlusconi's agenda.
2662	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The day after the elections, Berlusconi vowed to crack down on illegal immigrants, saying those involved in crime were part of an "army of evil."
2663	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	Berlusconi, elected with a solid margin, vowed to cooperate with Italy's neighbours in "deporting non-EU citizens who are here and do not have work or home and are forced into crime in order to live."
2664	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The incoming interior minister, Northern League member Roberto Maroni, said after the vote that he wants to beef up policing and step up "cleansing" of illegal immigrants.
2665	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"We need more cleansing and more police," he told the leading daily Corriere della Sera, linking crime to "immigration, often clandestine."
2666	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	Maroni also hinted that specific steps would be taken against Romanian citizens.

2668	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The International Rugby Board (IRB) Council said Thursday it had approved a global trial of Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) designed to reduce the number of turnover situations in a match for a 12-month period starting on August 1, 2008.
2669	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The trial will cover all levels and involve 13 of the 23 ELVs, dubbed Stellenbosch after the South African university where the rules were first tested out.
2670	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The new rules were introduced on an experimental basis in approved tournaments around the world since 2006 and now will be rolled out in the northern hemisphere, the IRB said in a statement.
2671	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	"The Council's decision to implement a global trial of Experimental Law Variations represents an important milestone for the future of the Game.
2672	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	It vindicates the process that was adopted by Council in 2004 for future Law amendments.
2673	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The Council congratulated the Law Project Group on its unprecedented work over the past two years," said IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset.
2674	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The ELVs are essentially designed to help promote more ball in play and attractive free-flowing rugby and have already been trialled in the southern hemisphere.
2675	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB added it had agreed that ELVs concerning sanctions not already approved for global trials would be further trialled in a selected elite Northern Hemisphere competition in the 2008/09 season.
2676	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB continued: "The Southern Hemisphere will continue to play under the various ELV programme environments that exist in that part of the world at present.
2677	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	It would be unfair to change the playing environment under which countries in the south are currently playing in competitions such as the Super 14."
2678	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The rule changes came after a laws study group was tasked with suggesting changes to speed up the game while reducing the influence of penalty-kicks which would in future only result from foul play and offside.
2679	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	Other offences would merit a free-kick or scrum award.

2685	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's White House drive picked up pace Friday with more superdelegates rallying to his side, including the head of a leading union, as former rival John Edwards all but endorsed his campaign.
2686	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Since Obama's convincing win in North Carolina on Tuesday over rival Hillary Clinton and their photo-finish finale in Indiana, nine more of the Democratic Party elite with free votes on the nomination contest have swung over to the Illinois senator.
2687	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	The trickle of support is predicted to turn into a flood, with only six primaries now left in their marathon battle to carry the party's flag into the November presidential elections against Republican John McCain.
2688	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Edwards, who dropped out of the close race in late January, stopped short of endorsing Obama on Friday, but said he has virtually wrapped up the contest, ahead of the last primaries on June 3.
2689	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"Let's just assume that Barack is the nominee because it's headed in that direction," he told NBC television.
2690	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He added he thought Obama, who is on a historic quest to be the country's first black president, also had a "better chance" to beat McCain.
2691	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	While the former first lady had fought a good campaign, "the problem is the numbers," Edwards said, referring to the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the party's nomination.
2692	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who is also seeking to make history by being the first woman elected to the Oval Office, trails behind Obama in the number of pledged delegates to the party's nominating convention in August.
2693	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And while she still holds the lead in the number of superdelegates, whose vote will be decisive in who wins the party nomination, Obama is hot on her heels.
2694	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Independent pollsters RealClearPolitics.com on Friday put Obama ahead with 1,854 delegates, including 265 superdelegates, compared to 1,696 for Clinton, who has pocketed some 272 superdelegates.
2695	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	That leaves more than 250 superdelegates still uncommitted, at least publicly.
2696	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In a further blow to Clinton's White House hopes, another one of the party grandees defected from her side Friday.
2697	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs," Congressman Donald Payne told the Newark Star-Ledger.
2698	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And three other superdelegates also came out for Obama.
2699	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	His campaign announced that Ed Espinoza, a Democratic National Committee member from California, was backing Obama, while The Oregonian reported that Representative Peter Defazio pledged his support to him.
2700	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama also picked up the support of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents some 600,000 government workers, and its president John Gage, who is also a superdelegate.
2701	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"Our people were impressed by the vitality, enthusiasm and broad- reaching campaign of Senator Obama," Gage told AFP, adding he had also been impressed by Obama's grass roots, high-tech organization.
2702	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"We think the country needs change and we think now is the time."
2703	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He admitted it been an "excruciatingly hard" decision, but hoped the union's backing would help sway others and bring the party's longest ever nominating race to a swift end.
2704	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, however, has vowed no surrender and plunged straight back into campaigning before the May 13 primary in West Virginia, where she is favored in polls.
2705	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	On Friday she was in Oregon, which will hold its primary along with Kentucky on May 20.
2706	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he could declare victory after the May 20 primaries which may put him over the top, in terms of elected delegates.
2707	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In that event, "we can make a pretty strong claim that we have got the most runs and it's the ninth inning and we have won," Obama said Thursday, using a baseball analogy.
2708	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In another sign of his growing stature, Obama was mobbed by Democratic lawmakers during an unannounced visit to Congress on Thursday.
2709	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	At least 10 superdelegates escorted him out of one meeting, jostling to get into the camera shot with him, despite not having publicly announced their support.

2714	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Some 150 people were injured.
2715	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The high winds ripped roofs off houses, and other homes were crushed to kindling as the storms downed power lines, utility poles and trees.

2718	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry declared a state of emergency in the disaster area, and planned to visit it later Sunday.
2719	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all of the other Oklahoma communities that have been impacted by the latest wave of severe weather," Henry told CNN.
2720	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	National Guard troops were called to shut off access to Picher.
2721	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The state said that about 6,300 homes and businesses were without electric power, including 3,000 near Tulsa.
2722	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The storms barrelled eastward and killed one person in the Southeastern state of Georgia in the early morning hours of Sunday, that state's emergency management agency said.
2723	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The small town of Kite, with some 1,000 residents, was apparently devastated.
2724	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"From what I understand it has been completely destroyed," said department spokeswoman Lisa Janak.
2725	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"It experienced significant damage."

2729	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"The National Weather Service will have to send out a survey team to determine that for sure," she said.
2730	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Some 18,000 residents were without power in the state, Georgia Power told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

2733	AFP_ENG_20080511.0342.LDC2009T13	Serbian President Boris Tadic, the flag-bearer of the pro- European camp in crucial general elections on Sunday, expressed confidence of victory over nationalist forces.
2734	AFP_ENG_20080511.0342.LDC2009T13	"I am totally sure that people of Serbia are going to vote for their European future, and also to contribute in terms of our capability to defend our legitimate interest in Kosovo, to defend our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Tadic told foreign reporters after voting in Belgrade.
2735	AFP_ENG_20080511.0342.LDC2009T13	"These elections are going to be vitally important for my country," said Tadic, who is also the leader of the Democratic Party (DS), which heads an alliance of pro-European forces.
2736	AFP_ENG_20080511.0342.LDC2009T13	"We have two main goals: to defend territorial integrity and sovereignty in Kosovo, to find a compromise solution in negotiating process with Albanians in Kosovo.

2740	AFP_ENG_20080511.0342.LDC2009T13	Like his nationalist rivals, Tadic also opposes the independence of Kosovo, but not at the expense of the Balkan country's integration into the 27-nation European Union.
2741	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Boxing: Bradley headed for the big time after Witter defeat
2742	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Timothy Bradley has set his sights on becoming the king of the world's light- welterweights after capturing the WBC belt in shock split point decision win over Junior Witter.
2743	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	In his first professional fight outside of his native California, Bradley knocked Witter over in the sixth round and did enough to claim the World Boxing Council title by judges' decisions of 115-113 and 114-113 for, and 115-112 against.
2744	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It was a controlled, clever and calculated display from Bradley, who not only conceded home advantage but ten years to the more experienced Witter.
2745	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Englishman Witter looked on the verge of suffering his first stoppage defeat when Bradley caught him with a looping right.
2746	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I always knew I would get to Junior in the second half of the fight," Bradley told AFP.
2747	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"He pulls back his chin in the air so I felt I could throw a counter right and it worked in the sixth.
2748	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"It’s a punch that I have worked on.
2749	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew the first four rounds would be hard but through the sixth and seventh rounds I came on.

2751	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter, 34, sank to the canvas in his own corner to take a mandatory eight count and sensibly avoided any danger by back- pedalling for the rest of the sixth round.
2752	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter's early control of the fight dissipated and Bradley landed more blows as the English boxer struggled with his timing.
2753	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	At the end of the fight, Witter looked concerned as to the outcome and Bradley is now left in line for bigger pay days against the other world champions in the division -- Andreas Kotelnik (WBA), Paulie Malignaggi (IBF) and Ricardo Torres (WBO).
2754	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Bradley, 24, also claimed he is willing to grant Witter a rematch or face his British rival Ricky Hatton, who is still regarded as the division's best boxer despite currently not owning one of the four world title belts.
2755	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I love Ricky Hatton and I would love to fight him.
2756	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	If the fight took place in the USA and the money was right, I would fight Junior again too," he said.
2757	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter admitted he was not in the sort of form that had seen him knock out former WBA champion Vivian Harris in September, and blamed over-training for his poor performance.
2758	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"My timing and speed just wasn't there.
2759	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I always thought if I just turned up I would win, but I didn't turn up.
2760	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"Getting put down in the sixth cost me the fight, but I still thought I did enough to win the fight.
2761	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I was sloppy though and just couldn’t get my timing right.
2762	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I was 70 per cent of what I should have been out there.
2763	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It had nothing to do with making the weight, but I never felt great in the fight and it could be that I overtrained which was why I wasn't myself.
2764	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I've been training for six months non-stop and didn’t take enough time off."
2765	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter's promoter, Mick Hennessy, will look into the chances of getting the English boxer a rematch with Bradley later in the year.
2766	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	Airbus announces new delays to A380 programme
2767	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	European aviation giant Airbus on Tuesday announced more delays to the delivery of its giant A380 superjumbos, saying the current schedule was not one it could meet.
2768	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be able to deliver 12 of the aircraft in 2008 instead of the 13 previously announced, and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had earlier said it could manage, a statement said.
2769	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A review that led to the revised schedule did not cover financial costs, said the statement from parent company and aerospace giant EADS.
2770	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"The extent of the additional costs will be influenced by the actual production and delivery scenario," it said.
2771	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be discussing the new schedule with its customers in the coming months, the statement added.
2772	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A380 launch customer Singapore Airlines (SIA), which already has four of the aircraft and is awaiting a fifth in July, said Tuesday fresh delays could have an impact on its operations.
2773	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"Beyond these aircraft, the changes in production schedules will potentially have some impact, the details of which we will need to understand from Airbus," an SIA spokesman said.
2774	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA has ordered 19 A380 aircraft in all and took delivery of the first in October, some 18 months late after earlier technical problems held up production and led to a dramatic restructuring and cost-cutting programme at Airbus.
2775	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"We have seen the announcement from Airbus and are now waiting to hear from them in detail about what the changes to their production schedule mean for deliveries of our aircraft down the line," SIA said.
2776	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA launched the first commercial A380 flight from Singapore to Sydney in October, followed by services to London.
2777	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A380 flights to Tokyo are to begin on May 20.
2778	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The double-decker plane can carry 853 people.
2779	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The Airbus announcement confirms last week's report in the German business magazine Wirtschafts-Woche which said Airbus faced more production delays on the A380 super jumbo, the world's largest passenger aircraft.
2780	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	EADS shares fell sharply in the wake of that story.
2781	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The report said quality problems on components, and airline interior design requirements -- which make production more complex -- were causing difficulties.

2783	AFP_ENG_20080514.0156.LDC2009T13	At least a dozen militants including foreign fighters were killed Wednesday in a suspected US missile strike on two houses in northwestern Pakistan, a senior security official said.
2784	AFP_ENG_20080514.0156.LDC2009T13	Two missiles apparently fired by a US drone aircraft demolished a house and a compound used by suspected Al-Qaeda militants in Bajaur tribal region near the border with Afghanistan, the official, who declined to be identified, told AFP.
2785	AFP_ENG_20080514.0156.LDC2009T13	"We have reports that the missile strike killed at least 12 militants including some foreigners," the official said.
2786	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Football: Smith tells Gers to forget Euro heartbreak and complete treble
2787	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Walter Smith has urged his Rangers players to forget the disappointment of their UEFA Cup final defeat here on Wednesday and concentrate on completing the domestic treble that remains in their grasp.
2788	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers can add the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup titles to the League Cup they have already secured this season and Smith said his squad had to retain their focus for the remaining four matches of the campaign.
2789	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"We are disappointed to lose a final at the end of what has been a very long campaign for us," Smith said after seeing his side beaten 2-0 by Zenit St Petersburg, whose technical superiority finally yielded two goals in the final 20 minutes of Wednesday's final at the City of Manchester stadium.
2790	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"Obviously it will be difficult to judge how much the disappointment takes out of the players.
2791	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But what is at stake for them is that we have an opportunity with four games to go to win two trophies so I would hope that we can overcome the disappointment we have suffered.
2792	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"If we win our next three games in the SPL and become champions we will be happy."
2793	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' cause was not helped by the refusal of SPL bosses to extend the season, which would have enabled Smith's men to avoid playing last weekend, as Zenit were able to do.
2794	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But Smith refused to blame the intense end-of-season schedule for his side's wilting at the end of what was their 64th match of a campaign that started in late July last year.
2795	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think that had any influence on the result," Smith said.
2796	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"The players tonight were ready to play and we were just coming into the match when they scored and that first goal changed the whole complexion of the game."
2797	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' hopes of securing a first European trophy in 36 years were crushed 18 minutes from time, when midfielder Igor Denisov combined smoothly with man-of- the-match Andrei Arshavin before slotting home for the Russian champions.
2798	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Konstantin Zyrianov added a close-range second in stoppage time to make sure Zenit emulated the achievement of 2005 winners CSKA Moscow and condemned the tens of thousands of Rangers supporters who had descended on Manchester to a miserable journey back to Scotland.
2799	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Arshavin, who is being tipped as a potential star of Euro 2008, was also involved in the build-up to the second goal and Smith acknowledged that a player of his guile was something Rangers lacked.
2800	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I think we have missed a little bit of that all through the year -- somebody who can do something a little bit different.
2801	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have a good work ethic in this team and it has taken them a long way but in a few games we have lacked someone to give us a little bit more creativity.
2802	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think anyone, myself or the players, thought this season would lead to a European final.
2803	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"So you have to give them credit for what they have achieved against a lot of good European sides."
2804	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith believes Zenit are good enough to go on to make an impact in the Champions League next season, although Advocaat admitted he could face a battle to keep his squad together.
2805	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I have no doubt that some players will go and then you have to start again.
2806	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	It is always the problem with success.
2807	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We already sold Martin Skrtl to Liverpool but you have to keep players like that if you want to become even better.
2808	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"It is not only Arshavin we have to keep.
2809	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	There are other players who are very important to us.
2810	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have to try to keep this team together and add three or four players so that we can rotate.
2811	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	At the moment it is always the same 12 to 14 players who play but to go to the next level you need more than that."
2812	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Zenit were denied a blatant penalty on the stroke of half-time, when Kirk Broadfoot handled in the area, but overall Rangers did a good job of containing Zenit until 18 minutes from the end.
2813	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith's men, who were showing signs of fatigue, were partly to blame for their own downfall having lost possession from their own throw on the left.
2814	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The ball was quickly worked forward by the Russians and Denisov played a deft one-two with Arshavin before sliding the ball past Neal Alexander and Zyrianov wrapped things up in stoppage time.

2822	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	"I no longer have a wife and I lost my house.
2823	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	All I've got are the clothes that I'm wearing," he says with a blank look behind his small oval glasses.
2824	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	He had tried in vain to call his wife by mobile telephone.

2835	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	Chinese officials have acknowledged that it is becoming increasingly unlikely to find any survivors from the country's worst disaster in a generation, which the government has killed at least 50,000 people.
2836	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	While in previous disasters survivors have been found after two weeks in the rubble, such experiences are considered miracles.
2837	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	But people are not giving up hope in Beichuan, where everywhere people head to the former apartments or offices of their loved ones in the chance of good news.

2857	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	A Swiss museum will return a 19th century painting by British landscape artist John Constable to relatives of French Jews 65 years after it was stolen and auctioned in wartime occupied France, a local official said Friday.
2858	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	The Musee des Beaux-Arts in Chaux-de-Fonds in the west of Switzerland was "reasonably convinced that this painting was looted," town councillor Jean- Pierre Veya said.
2859	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	The mayor had decided to return the painting on "moral" grounds, even if there are no Swiss laws requiring such a restitution, Veya told AFP.
2860	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	The 1820 oil-on-canvas view of "Dedham from Langham" was confiscated from a Jewish family in the French town of Nice on the Mediterranean and sold at auction there in 1943.
2861	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	Veya said the Chaux-de-Fonds city hall had decided to return the work to the family of southern French art collectors John and Anna Jaffe after a request by Anna Jaffe's great nephew, a Paris- based teacher.
2862	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	But the city authorities were seeking an agreement whereby the new owner would be prepared to let the painting remain in the art gallery on loan in view of the work of restoration the gallery had done on it, he said.
2863	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	The museum had been exhibiting the painting for some 20 years.
2864	AFP_ENG_20080519.0187.LDC2009T13	A private collector donated it to the museum in the late 1980s after buying it from a Geneva art gallery in 1946.

2908	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
2909	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"Iran, if there were any kind of activity of any sort, is not going to be quiet and would react fiercely," Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari said here when asked what Tehran would do in the event of an attack.
2910	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	He added that oil prices, which have been driven to record levels partly because of fear about the loss of Iran's 4.0-million- barrel-a-day output, would rise sharply if Israel or the United States launched a military strike.
2911	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	His comments on the sidelines of an oil conference here came as Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking to US media, said that a "new process" was underway in the dispute about the country's nuclear programme.
2912	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The encouragement was greeted with scepticism by Washington but more positively in Brussels where EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana described as "interesting."
2913	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
2914	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
2915	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"A process is underway and it started with the package delivered by Iran," Mottaki said in an interview with US media in New York, according to the state- run IRNA news agency.
2916	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
2917	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	There has been a surge in speculation recently that Israel might be planning a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites after it emerged that Israel had carried out practice runs.
2918	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
2919	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday it would be in Iran's interest to accept the package and warned against provocative remarks that could destabilise the situation.
2920	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The White House said Wednesday that it was sceptical about Mottaki's comments and President George W. Bush again stressed that military action was possible despite his preference for diplomacy.
2921	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"I have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the United States is to solve this problem diplomatically," Bush told reporters in the White House Rose Garden.
2922	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Top US military chiefs said Wednesday that opening up a third front against Iran in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan would be "extremely stressful."
2923	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	No Iranian official has suggested in the past months that Tehran is ready to give any ground on the key question of enrichment, which Iran must suspend in order to enter the talks offered by the world powers.
2924	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had repeatedly vowed that Iran will never suspend enrichment and Khamenei himself has said many times over the past years that Tehran will not back down in the standoff.
2925	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful and it needs nuclear energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out.
2926	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The United States and its regional ally Israel have never ruled out military strikes to end what they see as Tehran's defiance.
2927	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	After warning of Iran's response to any aggression, Oil Minister Nozari stressed that the country, the fourth-biggest oil producer in the world, was a "reliable source of supply to the market and Iran remains a supplier forever."
2928	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Analysts fear that Iran would cease crude exports and could block key Gulf oil shipping routes if attacked.
2929	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"When just a statement (about a possible attack) makes this much volatility in the market, can you imagine that if any action happens ... what would be the result in the oil market?"

2935	AFP_ENG_20080707.0114.LDC2009T13	The two sides each own 50 percent of TNK-BP, Russia's third largest oil producer, but are not equally represented on the management company's board.

2937	AFP_ENG_20080707.0114.LDC2009T13	"We had hoped and still hope that they would exercise their fiduciary obligation to all TNK-BP shareholders and vote in favour of the dismissal," he said.

2951	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush Thursday signed a law expanding legal authority for wiretaps by spy agencies which he hailed as vital for America's security, after a fierce Congress battle.
2952	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"This law will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on our soil," Bush said as he signed the bill, calling it "vital to the security of our people."
2953	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad while respecting the liberties of Americans here at home," he said.
2954	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White House demand.
2955	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill had sparked fierce debate between civil liberties advocates who argue it eroded checks on the power of government and intelligence officials who feared the row was compromising their power to thwart terror attacks.
2956	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure, after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for telecom firms.
2957	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our midst," Bush said.
2958	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The attack changed our country forever.
2959	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	We realized America was a nation at war.
2960	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Against a ruthless and persistent enemy."
2961	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The president added: "The most important lessons learned after 9/11 was that America's intelligence professionals lack some of the tools they needed to monitor the communications of terrorists abroad.
2962	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's essential that our intelligence committee know who our enemies are talking to, what they're saying, and what they're planning."
2963	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	After the September 11 attacks, Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on calls and emails between the United States and abroad in cases that federal agents deemed may have a terror link.
2964	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The wiretaps went ahead without the permission of a special court set up to watch over government wiretapping operations inside the United States, provided for under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.
2965	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The program, revealed in 2005, caused public outcry and opponents argued that US privacy guarantees meant the intelligence agencies should seek court warrants from the FISA court to conduct such spying inside the country.
2966	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law says the FISA court mechanism is the only way the government can order electronic surveillance of terror suspects.
2967	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The 1978 law allowed the ultra-secretive National Security Agency to wiretap for 72 hours while waiting for the FISA court to approve the action.
2968	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows them to use any information they got even if the FISA court eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.

2976	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The operators of a Utah mine at the center of a collapse that led to nine fatalities in August last year have been fined 1.6 million dollars, health and safety officials announced Thursday.
2977	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said the operators of the Crandall Canyon Mine had failed to report repeated collapses at the facility which meant inspectors were unable to assess practices at the facility.
2978	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Six miners were killed on August 6 when pillars propping up tunnels some 1,500 feet (450 meters) underground collapsed.
2979	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Three rescue workers were killed 10 days later after a tunnel they were working in collapsed.
2980	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Richard Stickler, assistant secretary of labor for the MSHA, said the tragedy had stemmed from mine operator Genwal Resource's "reckless failure" to report three previous coal "outbursts", including one just three days before the initial incident on August 6.
2981	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	"These reporting failures were critical, because they deprived MSHA of the information it needed to properly assess the operator's mining plans," Stickler said in a statement.
2982	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	"MSHA also found that the operator was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor.
2983	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	This dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support."
2984	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The MSHA said Genwal had been fined 1.34 million dollars for violations that directly contributed to the deaths six miners.
2985	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The mine operators were also hit with fines totaling 296,664 dollars for 11 non- contributory violations arising from the investigation.
2986	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	A mining consultant, Agapito Associates, was fined 220,000 dollars for faulty analysis of the mine's design, the MSHA statement said.

2991	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Rice, who met North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui-Chun for the first time, said the talks had focused "overwhelmingly" on a protocol that Washington hopes will be agreed by early August.
2992	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Begun in 2003 before lapsing for three years, the six-country disarmament negotiations resumed after North Korea staged its first nuclear test in 2006, finally producing a landmark denuclearisation agreement in February 2007.
2993	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The negotiations then hit a deadlock at the end of last year when North Korea failed to meet a deadline to fully disable its weapons-grade plutonium plants and deliver a full accounting of its nuclear activities, including a suspected uranium enrichment program.
2994	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The deadlock was broken last month when North Korea handed over a partial accounting or "declaration" of its plutonium-related programmes that must now be completely dismantled and the whole process verified.
2995	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush has begun the procedure to remove North Korea from a blacklist of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism as well as ease economic sanctions on North Korea, though most remain in place.
2996	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Rice said that required a minimum of 45 days notification, the same period Washington has given North Korea to agree on the verification protocol.
2997	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I think it should be very well understood that unless we're satisfied that we can verify the declaration, we have been very clear that we're taking that into our assessment of when to go forward," Rice said.
2998	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"Nobody is going to trust the North Korean number on how much plutonium they made," Rice said.
2999	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	But she said there are "internationally recognised methods to verify the number of kilograms of plutonium made."
3000	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The protocol will "have to have specific measures, it will have to have means for access, and it will also have to have means to continue this process as new information becomes available," Rice said.
3001	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"This will be a strong protocol.
3002	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	All the parties yesterday talked about a rigorous protocol, talked about one that is to international standards."
3003	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"Given the proliferation risk of plutonium in the hands of an opaque non- transparent regime, particularly in ever larger quantities, it is very important to shut down that capability," the top US diplomat added.

3005	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Radovan Karadzic was a "saint" who only ever performed good deeds, the former wartime Bosnian Serb leader's female assistant told an Italian newspaper Friday.
3006	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Karadzic, who faces trial by a UN tribunal for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, was arrested in Belgrade on Monday, having evaded capture for more than a decade whilst using a fake identity.
3007	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Mila Damianov, a Belgrade native who says she met Karadzic under his assumed name Dragan Dabic at an alternative health seminar in late 2007, denied that their relationship went beyond a professional interest.
3008	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I was not his fiancee, I was his assistant, but also his pupil," she told La Repubblica.
3009	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"When I heard the news, I thought it must have been a mistake, and I'm still having difficulty believing it now.
3010	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I'm not angry at him.
3011	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	For me, he remains an exceptional person.
3012	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Personally, I've only seen Doctor Dabic do good.
3013	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I don't like to judge other people."
3014	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	She added: "We met about seven or eight months ago during an alternative medicine seminar in Belgrade.
3015	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Dabic was very competent in his field, which fascinated me."
3016	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"He told me he was caring for an autistic child.
3017	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I asked him if I could become his assistant and he accepted.
3018	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Thanks to the energy he put into it, this child has made enormous progress."
3019	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I never doubted his identity," she told the newspaper.
3020	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I saw him like a saint, an apostle for those who are suffering."
3021	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"He never spoke of politics.
3022	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I asked him a few questions about his past, but all he told me was that he had been married, that he had children and grand- children."
3023	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Asked if she wanted to see Karadzic again, Damianov replied: "Yes, certainly.
3024	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Why not?"
3025	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	One of the world's most wanted men, the wartime Bosnian Serb leader vanished the year after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted him in 1995, when the war in Bosnia was halted.
3026	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Karadzic, 63, is accused of orchestrating two of Europe's worst atrocities since World War II --the 44-month siege of Sarajevo which killed more than 10,000 people and the Srebrenica massacre of around 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
3027	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	He has been indicted for genocide, complicity in genocide, extermination, murder, wilful killing, persecutions, deportation and inhumane acts against Muslims, Croats and other non-Serb civilians during Bosnia's war.
3028	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	African cotton producers see no progress in US subsidy talks
3029	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	African cotton producers seeking a cut in US subsidies for US cotton producers voiced frustration Sunday as they claimed Washington offered "nothing concrete" during global trade talks underway here.
3030	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	"We cannot say that we are satisfied.
3031	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	There is nothing concrete," an African negotiator told AFP.
3032	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The so-called C4 group of West African cotton producers -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali -- met US Trade Representative Susan Schwab to discuss domestic cotton subsidies within the overall framework of mammoth talks to secure a new global free trade pact.
3033	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The C4 group has since 2003 been fighting for the cotton issue to be included in the Doha Round of World Trade Organisation negotiations.
3034	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The group wants industrialised countries, particularly the United States, to lower domestic subsidies that the African nations say weigh down world cotton prices and penalise poorer countries.
3035	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	They were assured that the issue would be treated "ambitiously, expeditiously and specifically" by WTO trade partners in 2004.
3036	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	But the African negotiator said Sunday that there had been "no advances" in the talks with Schwab.
3037	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	"The US promised they would do more on cotton than on the rest of agriculture, but they don't want to announce anything right now," he said.
3038	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	"There weren't even any signals at this stage on what figures they might propose," he added.
3039	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The group wants to see subsidies cut by 82.2 percent in the US, a figure included in a negotiating text that is forming the basis of discussions on a new free-trade pact.
3040	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	Schwab's spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel told AFP that the two sides "discussed creating opportunities for African farmers to export through lowering tariffs and barriers imposed on cotton."
3041	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	But the African diplomat said market access was not the issue, stating: "What we want is for them to relieve us of the burden of (their) subsidies."
3042	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	ETA blamed as small bomb goes off on Spanish beach
3043	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	A small bomb exploded on a beach in the popular southern Spanish resort town of Torremolinos early Tuesday in an attack blamed on the Basque separatist group ETA.
3044	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	No-one was injured by the device which went off without warning.
3045	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"This was an ETA bomb," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told a news conference, adding he did not think this meant the outfit had a "stable structure" in the southern Andalucia region which is popular with sunseekers.
3046	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	The explosion happened just after midnight (2200 GMT Monday) on a crowded seafront close to the Aloha Puerto hotel, a police spokesman told AFP.
3047	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	Cadena Ser radio said the device contained one kilogram (about two pounds) of explosives.
3048	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"There was a lot of dust," the owner of a beachfront restaurant located near the site of the blast, Rafael Sanchez, told reporters.
3049	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"People started to scream.
3050	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	There were people who were left dizzy or crying and mothers who removed their children from the area," he added.
3051	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	ETA regularly targets Spain's key tourism industry with small explosions at resorts during the summer holiday season as part of its 40-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland which has so far killed 823 people.
3052	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	Spain is the second-most visited country in the world after France and the tourism sector is a major source of employment.
3053	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"It's a clear attempt at causing alarm and trying to disrupt the tourist interests of Andalucia," said Torremolinos mayor Pedro Fernandez Montes.
3054	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	The explosion follows the arrest last week of several members of ETA's most active cell which the government blames for most of the attacks carried out by the outfit since it called off its ceasefire in June 2007.
3055	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	Anti-terrorism judge Baltasar Garzon on Sunday ordered the preventative detention of seven people on charges of belonging to the cell, including its suspected leader Arkaitz Goikoetxea who was found to have maps of Andalucia.
3056	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	A scrap merchant found a bag in Torremolinos containing a handgun, ammunition, detonators and a false military identity document, public radio RNE reported.
3057	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	The pistol was of the same model as one found to be in Goikoetxea's possession at the time of his arrest, it added.
3058	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	Four small bombs went off on July 20 at two popular seaside resorts in northern Spain, Laredo and Noja, following a warning call from ETA.
3059	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	A woman was slightly injured after being struck by a rock that was sent flying by one of the blasts while another woman who is pregnant was treated for shock.
3060	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	A small bomb went off in the early hours of Monday at a highway building site near the Basque town of Orio in another attack blamed on ETA.
3061	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	The blast damaged four vehicles and six shacks, a Basque interior ministry spokeswoman said.
3062	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	ETA declared a "permanent" ceasefire in March 2006, raising hopes for an end to the violence.
3063	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	But an ETA bombing at Madrid's airport in December 2006 that killed two men put an end to tentative peace talks with the government and in June 2007 the outfit formally called off its ceasefire.
3064	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Iran says nuclear talks 'positive and progressive'
3065	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Iran's top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said on Tuesday that talks with world powers aimed at resolving the crisis over its atomic drive were "positive and progressive," local media reported.
3066	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	"The negotiations have been positive and progressive, and in Geneva the seven nations got a better understanding of one another views," Jalili was quoted as saying by the Mehr news agency.
3067	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	He was referring to his talks on July 19 with representatives of major powers including EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and, for the first time, an official from Tehran's arch-foe the United States, William Burns.
3068	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	In Geneva, Iran was set a two-week deadline which expires on to give a final answer to world powers who have offered a package of incentives to try to persuade Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear work.
3069	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	But Iran has rejected any deadline, saying it was agreed in Geneva that it would during a two week period examine the proposal put forward by permanent UN Security Council members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany.
3070	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	The six nations, concerned that Tehran is pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons project, have offered to start pre-negotiations during which time Tehran would face no further sanctions if it did not add any more uranium-enriching centrifuges.
3071	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	The package, offered to Iran in June, includes trade incentives and help with a civilian nuclear programme in return for suspending enrichment.
3072	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Iran is under three sets of UN Security Council sanctions over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment, a process which makes nuclear fuel but can also create the fissile core of an atomic bomb.
3073	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in an interview with US television on Monday that if the United States adopted a genuinely new approach to his country Tehran would respond in a positive way.
3074	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	He also denied that Iran was working to manufacture a nuclear bomb.
3075	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	The interview followed Ahmadinejad's announcement on Saturday that Iran had boosted the number of uranium-enriching centrifuges to 6,000, in an expansion of its nuclear drive that defies the international calls for a freeze.
3076	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak, whose country considers Iran its greatest threat, urged the United States during a visit to Washington to keep all options open in dealing with Iran's nuclear programme.
3077	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	"A policy that consists of keeping all options on the table must be maintained," Barak told US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, his ministry said on Tuesday.
3078	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	"Iran's plans pose a threat to regional and global stability.
3079	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	We insist that it is vital to continue tightening the economic and financial sanctions imposed on the Iranians."
3080	AFP_ENG_20080729.0292.LDC2009T13	Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear armed state in the Middle East although it has a policy of neither confirming or denying it has a nuclear arsenal and does not allow international inspections.

3086	AFP_ENG_20080729.0517.LDC2009T13	Iran on Sunday hanged 29 men convicted of offences including drug trafficking, murder and rape in the largest mass execution in years, as the country says it is fighting increasing crime.
3087	AFP_ENG_20080729.0517.LDC2009T13	Amnesty International reported that in 2007 Iran applied the death penalty more often than any other country apart from China, executing 317 people during the year.
3088	AFP_ENG_20080729.0517.LDC2009T13	Capital offences in the Islamic republic include murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery.
3089	AFP_ENG_20080729.0517.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups have accused Iran of making excessive use of the death penalty but Tehran insists it is an effective deterrent that is carried out only after an exhaustive judicial process.

3091	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	Recent comments by the Senegal's President Abduolaye Wade and other senior politicians suggest they want to increase censorship, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Wednesday.
3092	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	"The repeated scathing comments about the independent media can only aggravate the climate of hostility between the press and government," RSF Africa said in a statement from Dakar.
3093	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	"We urge the Senegalese authorities to respect the work of the media and allow the media regulatory body to do its job," it added.
3094	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	The group cited comments by Wade during a recent visit to the United States, when asked about the police beating of two journalists in Senegal following a football match in June.
3095	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	Asked if he was prepared to condemn the attack, he blamed the journalists for the incident and went on to suggest that most journalists were corrupt, said RSF.
3096	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	The group also mentioned a call by Air Transport Minister Farba Senghor for members of the ruling PDS party members to boycott pro-opposition media.
3097	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	Senghor, a close ally of president Abduolaye Wade and a leading PDS member, made the comments during on a news broadcast on Senegal's RTS state television.

3100	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Friday that his country will use force against its "enemies" to defend its nuclear drive, state television reported.
3101	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"For them, subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts.
3102	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against Iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in," Ahmadinejad said.
3103	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"But the Iranian people will resist with force against the enemies," state television quoted him as saying.
3104	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The comments came as the United States on Friday set a weekend deadline for Iran to respond to an international offer to freeze its nuclear drive.
3105	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We want and we expect a response this weekend," US State Department acting spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said.
3106	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	But an EU diplomat said in Brussels that the European Union is in no rush for a response from Iran.
3107	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of anonymity after Washington set the deadline.
3108	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We're in no rush" to have a response "in the next 24 hours."
3109	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Thursday that there was no deadline and that his country had already replied.
3110	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iran on July 4 handed major powers what it said was its "constructive and creative" response to their offer presented by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in June aimed at persuading Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear work.

3123	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	"We are working with the ministry of the interior in dealing with uncontrolled immigration of Zimbabwean women who are engaged in sexual activities in central Mozambique."
3124	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	She did not give details of the organisation's work with the government.
3125	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	Large numbers of women are believed to have fled poverty-stricken Zimbabwe, labouring under the world's highest inflation rate and major food shortages, to work as prostitutes in neighbouring Mozambique.
3126	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	According to government figures, Mozambique's HIV prevalence rate among the 16-to-49 age group is estimated at more than 16 percent.
3127	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	However some aid groups say the figure is higher.
3128	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	At least 15 civilians killed in Mogadishu blast
3129	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	A roadside bomb ripped through a group of female street cleaners in Mogadishu early Sunday, killing at least 15 of them, witnesses told AFP.
3130	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The explosion went off in the southern K4 neighbourhood as dozens of women supported by local NGOs gathered to sweep the area, leaving scenes of carnage in the street.
3131	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	"They were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood.
3132	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	I counted 15 bodies, most of them are women who were torn to pieces," eyewitness Hasan Abdi Mohamed said.
3133	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Mohamed said the explosion wounded around 40 people.
3134	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The blast was one of the deadliest incidents to hit civilians in the restive Somali capital in weeks and local residents rushed to help the wounded.
3135	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	"The number of casualties is increasing," said Ali Hasan Adan, another witness.
3136	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	"There are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that I cannot estimate," he said.
3137	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	"There is blood everywhere, dead and wounded people strewn across the street."
3138	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	"This is a tragedy, I have never seen such carnage.
3139	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	From what I can see, they are all women who were cleaning the area."
3140	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion but hardline Islamist groups have routinely targeted military convoys in the area with roadside bombs.
3141	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Ethiopian troops came to the rescue of Somalia's embattled and internationally- backed transitional government in late 2006, ousting an Islamist militia that had briefly controlled large parts of the country.
3142	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Islamist insurgents have since waged a deadly guerrilla war against government targets, Ethiopian forces and African Union peacekeepers.
3143	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Civilians have borne the brunt of the fighting, with international rights groups and aid agencies saying that at least 6,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced over the past year alone.
3144	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The Horn of Africa nation has been plagued by civil fighting and defied more than a dozen peace initiatives since the 1991 ouster of former president Mohamed Siad Barre led to chaos.
3145	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The United Nations sponsored a new peace initiative which led to the signing on June 9 in Djibouti of a truce agreement between the government and the main Islamist-dominated opposition movement.
3146	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	But the deal led to a split in the opposition, with hardliners insisting Ethiopian troops should leave before negotiations start.
3147	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Violence has continued to rock the capital almost daily and peace efforts suffered another blow Saturday when two thirds of the cabinet threatened to resign over alleged misuse of state resources by Prime Minister Nur Hasan Husein.
3148	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The premier said in a press conference that he had not yet received any minister's resignation but the move reflected differences between himself and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed.

3151	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	SEC unveils multibillion-dlr settlement with Citigroup
3152	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it had reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with US banking giant Citigroup regarding its marketing of complex debt securities.
3153	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The regulator said that under the settlement's terms, Citigroup has agreed to effectively buy back 7.4 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it marketed to tens of thousands of customers.
3154	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The deal also requires Citigroup to "liquidate" by the end of 2009 some 12 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it sold to other investors.
3155	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"Today’s agreement in principle provides real relief to investors," said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the head of the SEC's enforcement division.
3156	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"This settlement in principle is an outstanding example of federal and state regulatory cooperation for the benefit of investors and markets," Thomsen said at a news conference at SEC headquarters in Washington.
3157	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The settlement was announced by federal and state regulators as a widespread credit crunch continues to weigh on major Wall Street banks.
3158	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Officials said the buyback will benefit around 38,000 investors, small businesses and charities who had purchased the securities through Citigroup.
3159	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Auction-rate securities, essentially debt instruments issued by financial firms, municipalities and student-loan companies, typically have a fairly lengthy maturity, but the interest rates on such securities can be volatile and change at weekly and monthly auctions overseen by banks.
3160	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The SEC said Citigroup had marketed the securities as "liquid" investments, meaning they were almost as safe and accessible as cash, but the regulators said the securities were illiquid, making it hard for investors to reclaim their holdings.
3161	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Such instruments formed a vital and lucrative business for many banks in recent years, but the market for auction-rate securities collapsed in February as the credit squeeze -- which began in the housing and mortgage markets -- worsened.
3162	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The settlement comes on the heels of a separate investigation by New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo into how Citigroup marketed auction-rate securities.
3163	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"It will help to restore confidence in this marketplace," Cuomo said, referring to the Citigroup settlement.
3164	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Cuomo's office is also probing how other big banks marketed auction-rate securities.

3166	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates on Friday hit out at the heavy smog shrouding Beijing, saying it could permanently damage the environment.
3167	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Coates, an International Olympic Committee member, said he hoped a legacy of the Beijing Olympics would be that China takes more care in future.
3168	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	When asked if organisers had done enough to clean up the pollution, he said: "No.
3169	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	But I don't know what more thay can do.
3170	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"It may well be permanent damage.
3171	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Significant pollution is a problem, but we're getting on with it.
3172	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"Let's hope one legacy of the Games will be the realisation of the damage that has been done to the environment and will continue to be done unless they are more careful."
3173	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Coates' comments appear to fly in the face of the official line taken by the IOC, with the organisation's chief Jacques Rogge on Thursday hailing Beijing's "extraordinary" effort to cut pollution.
3174	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Air quality has been one of the top concerns for the 10,500 athletes coming to Beijing for the Olympics, with Rogge fanning those worries last year when he said endurance events could be postponed if the pollution was heavy.
3175	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"The Chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible and humanly possible to address this situation.
3176	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	What they have done is extraordinary," Rogge told reporters.
3177	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	On the same day, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in China told AFP that the pollution could hinder athletes during the Olympics, and that the long-term dangers to the population of the city were serious.
3178	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"There is an air pollution problem in Beijing," Hans Troedsson said.
3179	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"However, we are missing the point by having so much attention on the short-term exposure while the long-term exposure is really ignored -- that is where we have a problem," the Swede said.
3180	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Du Shaozhong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, insisted that air quality in Beijing was in line with WHO standards and said measures in place were designed to tackle the issue long-term.
3181	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"Most measures we have taken are long-term measures.
3182	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	These long- term measures won't be terminated just because the Olympic Games have come to an end," he said Friday.
3183	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Beijing has shut down many polluting industries and taken millions of cars off the road in an effort to improve air quality for the Games.
3184	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Despite concerns, Coates added that no one on the Australian team had so far suffered any respiratory problems as a result of the smog.

3186	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	Fabio Capello has guaranteed England will qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
3187	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	Capello is in confident mood ahead of the World Cup qualifying campaign, which begins against Andorra on September 6, and the Italian believes England have more than enough quality to reach the finals.
3188	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	The main obstacle to England's progress will be Croatia, who stopped Steve McClaren's team reaching Euro 2008 when they won 3-2 at Wembley last year.
3189	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	But Capello isn't concerned about any opponent and made the kind of bullish prediction that could come back to haunt him in two years time.
3190	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	"We will qualify for the World Cup.
3191	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	We will be in South Africa.
3192	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	I am sure of it," he said.

3196	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	The important thing is what we do."
3197	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008 led to claims that Capello has taken over a squad lagging behind the rest of Europe in technical and tactical ability.
3198	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	But the Italian watched most of the tournament, which finished with Spain's final triumph over Germany, and saw nothing that made him think England were inferior.
3199	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	"I watched some games live and saw the rest on TV," he said.
3200	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	"Only Spain played in a different style.
3201	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	Only the characteristics of their play was different.
3202	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	"But I have a lot of confidence in my team and I think we will be okay."
3203	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	Capello, who was speaking at the National Football Festival at Wembley which was organised by McDonalds, will name his squad for next Wednesday's friendly against the Czech Republic after Saturday's Premier League matches.
3204	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	The former AC Milan and Real Madrid coach will then reveal his new captain on Tuesday.
3205	AFP_ENG_20080811.0245.LDC2009T13	Rio Ferdinand has been tipped as Capello's favoured choice ahead of John Terry, Steven Gerrard and David Beckham and the England coach will give his chosen one the good news when the squad meet up next week.

3209	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	Washington has made no formal request from Ankara to allow two US hospital ships to sail through the Turkish Straits to Georgia, a US diplomat said Saturday, following reports that Turkey was dragging its feet on making a decision.
3210	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	"The United States is considering a lot of actions" to help Georgia amid its conflict with Russia over South Ossetia, the spokeswoman of the US embassy in Ankara, Kathy Schallow, told AFP.
3211	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	"But as far as I know, we have not made a formal decision about sending those two ships," she said, adding that "a formal request" for their passage through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits was not made either.
3212	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	Turkish foreign ministry officials were not available for comment.
3213	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that Washington's plans called for sending two US Navy hospital ships to Georgia, among other assistance.
3214	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	Unnamed US officials told McClatchy Newspapers that the two hospital ships likely to go -- the Comfort and the Mercy -- would take weeks to arrive and complained that Turkey was "sluggish and unresponsive" in granting them a permission to sail through the straits to the Black Sea.
3215	AFP_ENG_20080816.0188.LDC2009T13	Turkey's NTV news channel reported Saturday that the two ships' tonnage exceeded the limits set by the 1936 Montreux Convention, which governs international traffic through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits.

3221	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday labeled a recent visit by a UN envoy "a waste of time" as the ruling junta continued to trumpet its own vision of democracy.Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations' most senior negotiator with Myanmar, left the country Saturday after failing to secure a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, who is kept under house arrest by the ruling generals.
3222	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The junta said that the Nobel peace prize winner had refused to see Gambari, and on Sunday printed pictures in its New Light of Myanmar newspaper of his entourage waiting in vain outside her lakeside home in Yangon.
3223	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Nyan Win, a spokesman for the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party, said he did not know why their leader was unable to meet Gambari, but said no key demands of the democracy movement had been resolved.
3224	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"I have read reports in the newspaper that the authorities did not reply to the two aims of Mr. Gambari's mission," Nyan Win told AFP.
3225	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"One is to release political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the other is the dialogue between the government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, using an honorific to describe the pro-democracy leader.
3226	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"In conclusion, Mr. Gambari's visit resulted in no improvement and was a waste of time."
3227	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to a landslide election victory in 1990, but was never allowed to govern.
3228	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The military regime instead unveiled its own "road map" to democracy and after more than a decade of delays drafted a new constitution, which was approved in a referendum in May.
3229	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The junta says the charter will set the stage for elections in 2010, but the pro-democracy movement says the process simply enthrones the army's position in the nation it has ruled since 1962.
3230	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"We firmly believe that the way to bring about democracy peacefully is the seven-step road map," Information Minister Kyaw Hsan said in comments to Gambari published in the New Light of Myanmar on Sunday.
3231	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	He also told Gambari: "We have made all necessary arrangements for Your Excellency to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
3232	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Your Excellency also wished to meet with her and tried your best."
3233	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Gambari flew to Yangon last Monday hoping to revive talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime, but he was shunned by her and the junta's senior leadership, meeting only the prime minister, who holds little power.
3234	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	In a statement released late Saturday, the United Nations said only that Gambari held "open and extensive meetings" with Prime Minister Thein Sein.

3238	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Hull City striker Craig Fagan could be out for three months after a dreadful challenge by Newcastle's Danny Guthrie left the forward with a broken leg.
3239	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Fagan was shielding the ball in the corner, looking to play out time in Premier League new boys Hull's 2-1 win away to Newcastle on Saturday when Guthrie ploughed straight into the back of Fagan and then received a straight red card.
3240	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	His sending off compounded a miserable match for Newcastle, which came just a day before owner Mike Ashley put the club up for sale in response to protests by fans who blamed him for the exit of popular manager Kevin Keegan.
3241	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Fagan left the ground on crutches and Hull confirmed Monday that an X-ray had revealed the 25-year-old former Derby forward had suffered a fractured right tibia, which could keep him out of action for between six weeks and three months.
3242	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Angry Tigers manager Phil Brown said there was no excuse for Guthrie's tackle, telling the Hull Daily Mail: "It cannot be tolerated, it needs to be kicked out of the game.

3280	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	It took a real-world crisis to wrench the White House race away from lipstick and pigs, with the Wall Street meltdown offering a sudden chance of a breakout moment for Barack Obama or John McCain.
3281	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	After feuding all year over who could best handle a "3 am" call in the White House, the candidates faced a real judgment call when iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, sparking global stocks contagion.
3282	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Multiple polls show the staggering US economy is the number one issue 49 days before election day, but also reveal Democrat Obama and Republican McCain have yet to convince a majority of voters they know how to fix it.
3283	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Neither one of them has been able to craft a message that has been able to reach the American people," said Andrew Dowdle, assistant professor of political science at the University of Arkansas.
3284	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Both McCain and Obama went in search of that message Monday, courting voters who fear seeing their pension funds evaporate in the stocks freefall amid warnings other revered US financial instutitions were on the rocks.
3285	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Their focus on issues issue contrasted with last week's gutter politics which included the McCain camp accusing Obama of insulting Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin, in a distortion of his use of the phrase "lipstick on a pig."
3286	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama Monday immediately blamed eight years of Republican rule for the crisis, and predicted McCain would bring four more years of the same.
3287	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	His Republican rival promised a regulatory reform drive in Wall Street, and said Obama would hike taxes and thwart economic growth.
3288	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	But the Arizona Senator, who now leads his rival by a few points in national polls, opened himself up by declaring in Florida that the fundamentals of the economy were "strong."
3289	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Senator McCain, what economy are you talking about?"
3290	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama asked at a campaign event in Colorado, as his supporters immediately branded McCain as out of touch and the inheritor to the Bush administration's economic legacy.
3291	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the campaign Obama tried to capitalize on a comment by McCain that he did not know as much about the economy as he should.
3292	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Republicans have controlled the US purse strings for eight years, the unemployment rate is at a five-year high of 6.1 percent, gasoline and food prices are soaring and house prices are tumbling.
3293	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama and the Democrats seem yet to have reached the levels of empathy with hard-pressed voters achieved by his primary rival Hillary Clinton, or famously by her husband Bill Clinton in the 1992 campaign.
3294	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"It is amazing that they have not been able to do that to this point," said Dowdle.
3295	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	An ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month found 47 percent of voters trusted Obama to run the economy and 42 percent trusted McCain.
3296	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	The Democrat had enjoyed a much wider lead on the issue for much of this year.
3297	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain has struggled to navigate away from Bush economic legacy, and Democrats argue that his economic policies barely differ from those of the current president.
3298	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	But Carly Fiorina, a top economic advisor to McCain, blamed Wall Street, lax regulation by the Bush administration and two years of Democrats in control of Congress for the economic blight.
3299	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	On MSNBC, Fiorina accused the Bush administration of presiding over a "Wild, Wild, West," with little regulation -- positioning McCain as a agent of reform and change -- not a prisoner of the president's legacy.
3300	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain's spokesman Tucker Bounds issued an acidic response to Obama's complaints about the Arizona senator's "fundamentals" comment.
3301	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama's short career as a public servant has been defined by pessimism, defeatism and weakness in the face of the great challenges of our time," he said.
3302	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"His lack of faith in American workers may explain his willingness to raise taxes during a struggling economy, but it is not way to lead our country."
3303	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	That comment appeared to be a direct attempt to draw attention to Obama's short time as a national figure, and to raise doubts that he was fit to take on the daunting challenge of pulling the US economy out of its hole.
3304	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain is expected to press home that argument against Obama in three potentially decisive presidential debates beginning on September 26.
3305	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama supporters will see the forums as his best chance to finally thrust home a winning message on the economy.

3307	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	The head of the International Energy Agency appealed Wednesday for oil producers to maintain output at current levels and said supply and demand tensions on the market should ease by year's end.
3308	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	"To make the situation better, we want to see OPEC and producing countries continue their current level of production," IEA director general Nobuo Tanaka told reporters during a conference here of the World Energy Council.
3309	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	"Then, thanks to the (economic) slowdown in the United States and (developed) countries, the market fundamentals will improve," Tanaka said, describing current conditions as still tight.
3310	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which produces 40 percent of the world's oil, earlier this month cut output by some 500,000 million barrels per day in an effort to shore up prices which have fallen sharply from record highs above 147 dollars in July.
3311	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	Oil prices were around 90 dollars Wednesday.
3312	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, OPEC cut its world oil demand growth forecast for 2008 to 1.02 percent from 1.17 percent previously, in the face of falling demand in the United States, the world's biggest energy consumer.
3313	AFP_ENG_20080917.0126.LDC2009T13	It also trimmed its 2009 forecast to 1.00 percent from 1.03 percent.

3320	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"The responsibility of the government... is first to avert chain reactions and to protect customers," and "to lead talks between European partners... so that action is concerted," he said.

3322	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"When some banking establishments or some credit establishments have committed mistakes, when they have been imprudent, it is not abnormal that one day they pay for the consequences," he said.
3323	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	Earlier, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on French 24 television: "We are seeing a transformation of financial markets, of the role of people in finance and of bodies overseeing finance."

3327	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	At least 30 miners were feared trapped after an accident Saturday at a coal mine in northeast China, state media reported.
3328	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	Some 44 miners were working underground at the mine in Hegang, Heilongjiang province, when the accident occurred at around 4:00 am, Xinhua news agency said, quoting local authorities.
3329	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	Around a dozen miners escaped but more than 30 could be trapped in the mine, it said.
3330	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately known what caused the accident.
3331	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	China's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, with safety standards often ignored in the quest for profits and the drive to meet surging demand for coal -- the source of about 70 percent of the country's energy.

3342	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	South African lawmakers rubberstamped President Thabo Mbeki's resignation Tuesday, as he attempts to mend his bruised reputation from charges he interfered in the prosecution of rival Jacob Zuma.
3343	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ANC-dominated parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of effecting Mbeki's resignation from Thursday, September 25, with only 10 votes against the motion.
3344	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	African National Congress deputy chief Kgalema Motlanthe was named as the party's candidate to take over as head of state.
3345	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Parliament will on Thursday vote on his election, and he will be sworn in later in the day.
3346	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he says cost him his job as president.
3347	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	In a September 12 ruling, judge Chris Nicholson dismissed a corruption case against Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma, hinting that Mbeki had interfered in the decision to prosecute his foe.
3348	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, 66, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in June 1999, becomes the country's first democratically elected president to be forced out of office before the end of his term.
3349	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter," said Mbeki in his application.
3350	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified," he added.
3351	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC -- a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years," Mbeki said.
3352	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice," he added.
3353	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The court ruling that was to prove Mbeki's final downfall found that the executive might have interfered in the decision to prosecute the ANC chief.
3354	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I am not convinced that the applicant (Zuma) was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution," said Nicholson.
3355	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	He was ruling on an application by the state to strike out sections of an affidavit filed by Zuma's legal team that insinuated political interference in the decision to charge him.
3356	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki had been increasingly at loggerheads with his party, which split into two camps behind him and Zuma, after deciding to run for a third term as party president at a crunch ANC conference in December last year.
3357	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Zuma toppled him as chief at the conference, and is the frontronner to be president after elections in April 2009.
3358	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ruling throwing out corruption charges against Zuma led to a week of heavy political debate, and a lengthy meeting by the ANC executive who decided on Saturday to "recall" Mbeki in the interests of party unity.
3359	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	When announcing his resignation in a live address on Sunday, Mbeki denied he had " compromised the right of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide whom it should prosecute and not prosecute."
3360	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Following Mbeki's resignation, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka, Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad, and Science Minister Mosibudi Mangena have also tendered their resignations.
3361	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	According to Fitch Ratings, Mbeki's resignation adds a level of political uncertainty to South Africa's economy already challenged on both international and domestic fronts.
3362	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interim president and his or her team will have to carefully manage the transition so as to not worsen already weak investor sentiment and add to macroeconomic risks," it said.

3370	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Deputy spokesman Robert Wood said Hill's trip -- which includes stops in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo -- was part of effort "to get the process back on track."
3371	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	He will leave later Monday for Seoul, where he is to due to hold talks Tuesday with South Korean counterpart Kim Sook, Wood said.
3372	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	He will then travel to Pyongyang, though the exact date was not yet available.
3373	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	"We're very concerned about some of the reversal of disablement activities that the North has been engaged in," Wood told reporters during the daily briefing in Washington.
3374	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	"And he (Hill) obviously wants to consult with his counterparts in the region out there to see what our next steps are going to be with regard to a response to what the North is doing," Wood said.
3375	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, will be "in the region looking for ways to work with our allies to bring North Korea into compliance with its obligations."
3376	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Under the six-country pact, North Korea agreed to disable and dismantle key nuclear facilities and allow UN atomic inspectors to return, in return for one million tonnes of fuel aid and its removal from a US list of terrorist states.
3377	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	But North Korea announced last month it had halted the process in protest at Washington's refusal to drop it from the US blacklist of countries supporting terrorism, as had been promised.
3378	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Washington says the North must first accept strict outside verification of the nuclear inventory that Pyongyang handed over in June.

3380	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	The Bank of England on Wednesday offered a total of 40 billion dollars (21 billion euros) in short-term loans to banking institutions hit by the global credit crunch.
3381	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	The British central bank said in a statement that banks had snapped up 13.44 billion dollars of an available 30-billion- dollar loan.
3382	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	Borrowers will have to repay the cash on October 7.
3383	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	The BoE also offered a separate loan of 10 billion dollars that must be repaid on Thursday.
3384	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	A total of 7.47 billion dollars was taken up, it added.
3385	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	The Bank of England began last month injecting dollar funds into money markets as part of a coordinated central bank action.
3386	AFP_ENG_20081001.0356.LDC2009T13	Major central banks agreed to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets that have been hammered by the ongoing financial crisis.

3388	AFP_ENG_20081002.0549.LDC2009T13	The German group Linde, world leader in industrial gases, said Thursday it had taken full control of the Australian company Elgas for 126 million euros (175 million dollars).
3389	AFP_ENG_20081002.0549.LDC2009T13	Linde bought the outstanding stake in Elgas from AGL Energy, which co-owned the Australian specialist in liquified gases with Linde.
3390	AFP_ENG_20081002.0549.LDC2009T13	Elgas was created in 1984 and posted sales of 225 million euros in 2007.
3391	AFP_ENG_20081002.0549.LDC2009T13	It employs 460 people, Linde said.
3392	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Planning to protect new NATO members divides allies: official
3393	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	NATO's top commander wants to begin military planning to protect newer members of the alliance but allies are divided amid concerns over Russia's reaction, US defense officials said Monday.
3394	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	NATO lacks contingency plans to defend all its newer members from attack, a fact that suddenly became an burning issue for the Baltics and eastern European members after Russia's military intervention in Georgia in August.
3395	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	"This has sort of become politicized -- should you do con plans (contingency plans) or should you not do con plans, because of the message that it sends?"
3396	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	a senior defense official said.
3397	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The issue is expected to come up this week at a meeting in Budapest of NATO defense ministers, including US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the officials said in a briefing on Gates's trip.
3398	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	General John Craddock, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR), feels "that it's a very natural thing to do, contingency planning, because that's something that a military alliance should be in the regular business of doing," the official said.
3399	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Article Five of NATO's charter guarantees that the alliance will come to the defense of any member who is attacked.
3400	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Craddock has been in discussion with UN Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer over whether he can proceed on his own or needs the backing of NATO's political decision making body, the North Atlantic Council.
3401	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The general is considering conducting a risk assessment first, followed by contingency planning, the official said.
3402	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The official said Craddock did not need permission to do contingency planning but had gone to Scheffer "just to get a sort of signal pulse on that."
3403	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	"I think there's a general consensus that it's a very natural thing to do.
3404	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	But (with) all of the political pieces -- this becomes politicized very quickly."
3405	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Gates urged allies last month after an informal meeting in London to avoid provoking Russia but to pursue planning and exercises to reassure Baltic and East European allies worried about Moscow's intentions.
3406	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Scheffer said after the meeting that the alliance may step up planning and training for collective defense "here and there."
3407	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	But he said no one should be "surprised or alarmed" by it.

3409	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Fernando Gonzalez fought off five match points before defeating Latvia's Ernests Gulbis 4-6, 7-6 (13/11), 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the Austrian Open on Wednesday.
3410	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	The number two seed from Chile, who the day before had needed 138 minutes to dispose of Simone Bolelli, was on court for a further 130 minutes before securing his victory.
3411	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Gulbis, a French Open quarter-finalist, stretched the more experienced Gonzalez all the way in the opening two sets with his more varied game keeping his opponent guessing.
3412	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Mixing penetrating groundstrokes, frequent use of the dropshot and often playing serve and volley, he immediately recovered a break to level the first set at 3-3 and then broke against for the set with a perfectly executed drop volley.
3413	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Both players had break point opportunities in the second set, before Gulbis netted a weak backhand to give Gonzalez a break for 5-4.
3414	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	But the Chilean failed to serve out the set, and then was also unable to convert any of three break points at 5-5 as the set moved to a dramatic conclusion.
3415	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Gulbis held five match points in the 24-point tiebreak, before a double-fault allowed Gonzalez to level the match on his third set point.
3416	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez quickly established a lead in the deciding set, giving up just four points in the first three games before a final break, to love, left him serving for victory.
3417	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	"There were many match points and he was in control of the match," said Gonzalez.
3418	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	"Most of the time I was the guy who was running and trying to reach some balls, and he was the one who was going for it every time.
3419	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	"But I'm happy the way that I turned back the match and in the end I won 6-1 and that's really good for my confidence.
3420	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Maybe I'm not playing my best tennis and not feeling my forehand like I used to, but anyway I'm fighting and I'm still winning."
3421	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Third seed Juan Martin Del Potro from Argentina, playing his first match as a member of the world's top 10, withstood a spirited challenge from 219th-ranked wild card Martin Fischer, beating the Austrian 7-6 (9/7), 7-6 (7/5) to reach the second round.
3422	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Del Potro saved a set point in the first set tiebreak before claiming it on his own third set point.
3423	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Fischer also had an opportunity to claim the second set, breaking to lead 5-4 but then dropping his serve to love.
3424	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Fischer continued to challenge and served at 5-4 in tiebreak before Del Potro sealed victory on his third match point.

3427	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush was to sign legislation on Wednesday to enact a landmark US-India nuclear deal, in a lavish ceremony to highlight how the pact helps usher in a new era in relations.
3428	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee will make a surprise visit Friday to Washington so that he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice can formally sign the accord itself, a senior US official said.
3429	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the deal in July 2005, touching off a difficult battle with wary lawmakers on either side and critics who warn it undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear know-how.
3430	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The agreement offers India access to sophisticated US technology and cheap atomic energy in return for allowing UN inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities -- but not military nuclear sites.
3431	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Washington imposed a ban on US-Indian civilian nuclear trade after India's first nuclear test in 1974, but US officials have said a new approach is needed to help the world's largest democracy meet its booming energy needs at a time of skyrocketing oil prices and global warming fears.
3432	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of India’s emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an independent course from Washington.
3433	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The ceremony on Wednesday will draw Vice President Dick Cheney, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, and India's ambassador to Washington, Ronen Sen, to the White House's ornate East Room.
3434	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US lawmakers, and roughly 200 guests including Indian-American community leaders, will also attend the signing ceremony, according to Bush spokesman Carlton Carroll.
3435	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Neither Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama nor Republican rival John McCain were expected to break from campaigning to attend the signing.
3436	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership," Carroll said in a statement.
3437	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner," he said.
3438	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls global atomic trade.
3439	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
3440	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a foreign policy success.
3441	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
3442	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Singh also had a rough ride over the deal at home: The main opposition Hindu nationalists and the Communists have both slammed it as curbing India's military options and bringing the country's foreign policy too much under US influence.
3443	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	New Delhi was reluctant to sign the deal before Bush inked the pact but pledged during Rice's visit to India late last week to do so soon after.

3458	AFP_ENG_20081013.0538.LDC2009T13	The last time England played Spain in Madrid, in 2004, sections of the crowd at the Bernabeu stadium rained racist chants down on some of England's players.

3462	AFP_ENG_20081013.0538.LDC2009T13	Although an official agreement is yet to be reached between the FA and their Spanish counterparts, the fixture is expected to be played on Wednesday, February 11, the only remaining FIFA international date still to be filled.

3473	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that a recovery from the financial crisis "will not happen right away" but that the US economy will eventually emerge "with renewed vigor."
3474	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman said that the problems in the economy and markets "are large and complex, but in my judgment, our government now has the tools it needs to confront and solve them."
3475	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke said the crisis "has many novel aspects" stemming from the globalization of markets and quick movements of money and information but that "the current situation also has much in common with past experiences."
3476	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The Fed chairman did not use the term recession, as mentioned by San Francisco Fed president Janet Yellen on Tuesday, but he suggested the economy would remain weak for some time.
3477	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in markets and financial institutions.
3478	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The massive 700-billion-dollar rescue approved by US lawmakers and similar measures in other countries will go a long way toward steadying markets, he said.
3479	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away," Bernanke said.
3480	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Economic activity had been decelerating even before the recent intensification of the crisis.
3481	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to be a primary source of weakness in the real economy as well as in the financial markets, and we have seen marked slowdown in consumer spending, business investment and the labor market.
3482	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Credit markets will take some time to unfreeze."
3483	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke added that the overall recovery "will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning."
3484	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Yellen said Tuesday that the US economy was likely to see "essentially no growth" in the third quarter and that that the fourth quarter "appears to be weaker yet, with an outright contraction quite likely."
3485	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Indeed, the US economy appears to be in a recession," Yellen said.
3486	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke meanwhile expressed confidence in the longer-term outlook once the credit and banking problems are fixed.
3487	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"I strongly believe that we now have the tools we need to respond with the necessary force to these challenges," he said.

3490	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	Sri Lanka's largest biscuit maker said Thursday it was withdrawing one of its products from sale after Swiss authorities identified it as having traces of melamine.
3491	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	Ceylon Biscuits Limited said their Munchee Lemon Puff biscuits will be withdrawn from the market because of the reports, but maintained it was not using milk products from China.
3492	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	The "milk ingredients were sourced only from Australia, Holland and Canada," the company said in a statement.
3493	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	On Monday, authorities in the Swiss canton of Geneva identified Munchee Lemon Puff biscuits as containing traces of melamine.
3494	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	Melamine, a poisonous substance generally used in the manufacture of plastic, has been found to be added to Chinese milk, forcing dairy products and some confectioneries off the shelves in many countries.
3495	AFP_ENG_20081016.0698.LDC2009T13	Four Chinese children are known to have died and at least 53,000 made ill after consuming melamine-laced milk.

3497	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Columbus Blue Jackets center Michael Peca was handed a five-game suspension by National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman on Friday for grabbing a referee by the arm during an October 10 game.
3498	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	The 34-year-old Canadian pleaded his case to Bettman on Thursday in an appeal over the incident, which came in a 5-4 over-time triumph at Dallas.
3499	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Peca has already served two games of what had been an indefinite suspension but will be unable to return to the Columbus lineup until next Friday's game against the New York Rangers.
3500	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	The 14-year veteran will also forfeit 35,349 dollars in salary for violating Rule 41 regarding physical abuse of an official at 5:21 of the second period following a goal by the Stars.
3501	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Peca grabbed the arm of referee Greg Kimmerly, solely to obtain the official's attention according to Peca, while complaining about the play.
3502	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Peca received a 10-minute misconduct for verbal abuse of Kimmerly and a game misconduct for the arm grab under physical abuse rules that mandate automatic bans of three, 10 or 20 games.
3503	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	The violation was first regarded as a 10-game ban but Bettman reviewed Peca's testimony and a video replay of the incident with the four officials who worked the game, who agreed a three-game ban was more fitting.
3504	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Bettman used his power to add two games to the ban for what was called "physically demeaning" conduct.
3505	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	"Michael Peca crossed the line by making physical contact with referee Kimmerly," Bettman said.
3506	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	"His conduct, regardless of the type or nature of precipitating events, was inexcusable and showed a lack of respect for our officials and for the game itself."

3508	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern Munich ignored their poor league form to secure a convincing 3-0 win over Fiorentina in Tuesday's Champions League match in Munich to take control of Group F.
3509	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	First-half goals by Germany striker Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger, as well as a strike by Brazilian Ze Roberto on 90 minutes made the win safe.
3510	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Despite a dramatic slump in recent weeks which has seen them crash to 11th in the Bundesliga, Bayern forgot their domestic league form to take another three points in the quest to add to their 2001 Champions League crown.
3511	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	The victory will take some of the pressure off Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann who picked up his first win of October last weekend -- his first in four league games -- as Munich's fortunes look to be improving.
3512	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	With two wins and a draw under their belt in Group F, Bayern are now on the verge of making the first knock-out phase with seven points from Lyon second on five.
3513	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But the result leaves Fiorentina in a precarious position -- especially after Lyon's 5-3 win at Steaua Bucharest -- at third in the table.
3514	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern had a dream start when Luca Toni brushed off a rib injury to face his former club and flicked the ball into the path of Miroslav Klose who out-paced the defence to drill the ball into the corner after just four minutes.
3515	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Then Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger capitalised on a mistake in the defence on the edge of the area and smashed his shot past Fiorentina's French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey on 25 minutes to make it 2-0 at the break.
3516	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Having scored 31 league goals for La Viola in the 2005/06 season, Toni is still a firm favourite amongst Fiorentina fans despite playing for Bayern and received a warm response when he was replaced on 57 minutes.
3517	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	His replacement, Germany striker Lukas Podolski, was soon into the action and had a chance to score on 61 minutes when French midfielder Franck Ribery put him into space.
3518	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But Cesare Prandelli's team will leave Munich disappointed they did not finish their chances having had some 23 shots on goal, compared to Bayern's 15, but were constantly frustrated by Bayern's defence.
3519	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	And on the stroke of 90 minutes Bayern's Ze Roberto unleashed an unstoppable shot which gave Frey little chance and made sure the Italians return home empty handed.
3520	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But with three games left for both teams there is still all to play for in the return leg on November 5 when the two sides meet at Fiorentina's Artemio Franchi stadium.

3524	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	The domestic assets in what used to be Iceland's biggest bank Kaupthing have been transferred to a new bank controlled by the Icelandic state, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) said Wednesday.
3525	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	"The FME has now decided to transfer a part of Kaupthing's operations to a new bank that has been formed and is fully owned by the Icelandic government," it said in a statement.
3526	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	"The decision ensures continued banking operations for Icelandic families and businesses," it said.
3527	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	With its announcement, the FME made clear the new bank, called New Kaupthing, would take over all the old bank's domestic assets, while its international operations had been separated to be sold off.
3528	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	The government announced that it was taking control of Kaupthing on October 9 -- after also taking over the second and third biggest banks Landsbanki and Glitnir -- following the collapse of Iceland's financial sector due to a liquidity shortage.
3529	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	According to the FME, the new bank's equity will be 75 billion kronur (500 million euros, 641 million dollars) and the size of its balance sheet 700 billion kronur.
3530	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	The authority had announced a similar procedure for Glitnir last week.

3532	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Around 40 African migrants took advantage of flood damage at the border to cross into Spain's North African enclave of Melilla from Morocco on Monday, police and local government officials said.
3533	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Seventeen people were detained shortly after entering Spanish territory while the rest managed to enter the city of roughly 70,000 people which was lashed by heavy rain and strong winds on Sunday, a local police spokeswoman told AFP.
3534	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	A total of 65 migrants tried to enter through a lock in a flood channel near the border post of Beni-Enzarhich which was damaged by the rough weather and could not be closed properly, she said.
3535	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Earlier on Monday the Spanish government's office in Melilla said about 30 African migrants tried to cross into Melilla from Morocco at the border checkpoint and an unknown number had succeeded.
3536	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Melilla has boosted police presence along its border with Morocco after Sunday's heavy rains destroyed a 30-metre (yard) stretch of wire fencing set up to keep illegal immigrants out of the city.
3537	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	The rain also flooded streets, knocked down trees and disrupted maritime and air traffic for several hours on Sunday.
3538	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	The border barriers between Melilla and Morocco have been regularly assaulted in the past by migrants trying to enter Spanish territory, although tighter border security has reduced the frequency of such attempts.
3539	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	In 2005, 14 migrants were killed while they tried to cross the border.
3540	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	They included several shot by Moroccan or Spanish security forces during assaults on the borders of Melilla and Ceuta, another Spanish enclave in North Africa.

3544	AFP_ENG_20081028.0065.LDC2009T13	The game was heading for a 0-0 draw until Bayer's Brazilian midfielder Renato Augusto put in a cross and a mix-up in the Bremen defence allowed midfielder Arturo Vidal a simple tap in.
3545	AFP_ENG_20081028.0065.LDC2009T13	And after the Chilean's goal on 71 minutes, another mistake in the Bremen defence allowed Germany defender Manuel Friedrich to lob Bremen goalkeeper Christian Vander just nine minutes later to leave Bremen red faced.
3546	AFP_ENG_20081028.0065.LDC2009T13	"It was great the way the game worked out for us," said Leverkusen coach Bruno Labbadia.
3547	AFP_ENG_20081028.0065.LDC2009T13	"We were very good in defence and barely allowed them any chances.

3569	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	A former speaker of parliament has denounced reports that Iranian MPs are being offered government cash to vote against impeaching the interior minister, who lied about his education, the Mehr news agency said Friday.
3570	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	"God save us from money being given to a deputy asking him to vote for or against someone or for or against a bill," said Gholam-Ali Hadad Adel, who headed parliament from 2004 until he stepped down earlier this year.
3571	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Hadad Adel's remarks come two days after a stormy incident in parliament, in which media reported that a conservative deputy slapped the government's parliamentary representative, accusing him of vote buying.
3572	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	According to the reports, MPs were being offered cheques for 50 million rials (5,215 dollars, 4,085 euros), ostensibly to benefit mosques in their districts.
3573	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	However, they were asked to sign an undertaking not to vote to censure Interior Minister Ali Kordan.
3574	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham announced on Friday that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered the opening of an investigation, semi-official Fars newsagency reported.

3576	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Parliament will vote on Tuesday whether to impeach Kordan for "dishonesty" after he confessed to holding a fake Oxford University degree.
3577	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Kordan, who only took office in August, has been under pressure to resign after the prestigious British university denied awarding him any qualification through a representative, as he had claimed.
3578	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	"The minister has claimed to have been deceived by the Oxford University's representative ... Whether he has been deceived or dishonest, such a person does not deserve to be interior minister," reads the censure motion.

3612	AFP_ENG_20081108.0147.LDC2009T13	Sfaxien managed to create several clearcut scoring chances during the second half, but an Etoile team playing only their second match under caretaker French coach Herve Gauthier survived.
3613	AFP_ENG_20081108.0147.LDC2009T13	The club meet again on November 22 in the Mediterranean resort of Sousse with the winners becoming the first club to win twice the African equivalent of the European UEFA Cup.
3614	AFP_ENG_20081108.0147.LDC2009T13	Etoile, the only side to win every African club competition, lifted the Confederation Cup in 2006 and other former winners include Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Moroccan military oufit FAR Rabat.

3618	AFP_ENG_20081111.0719.LDC2009T13	Suspected drug-related violence left 19 dead in the northern Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez, including a charred, armless body dumped at a police station, local officials said Monday.
3619	AFP_ENG_20081111.0719.LDC2009T13	Officials at first said the body had been decapitated, but a spokesperson for the local district attorney's office said late Monday that the unidentified body, which had been thrown from a car in front of the police station, had no arms.
3620	AFP_ENG_20081111.0719.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere, an armed commando shot and killed two men and two women outside Ciudad Juarez hospital, a police official said.
3621	AFP_ENG_20081111.0719.LDC2009T13	Another 13 died in separate attacks in the violent city across the border from the US city of El Paso, Texas, which has Mexico's highest murder rate this year, with more than 1,300 killed.

3624	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	Philippine exports rose 1.2 percent year on year to 4.4 billion dollars in September, although the key electronics sector softened, the government said Wednesday.
3625	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	The easing in electronics shipments, the country's top export, was offset by gains in sales of petroleum and copper, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
3626	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	The September figure is slightly higher than the 4.3 billion dollars in exports during the same period last year.
3627	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	In the nine months to September, shipments rose 4.0 percent to 38.87 billion dollars from 37.36 billion dollars for the same period last year, the NSO said.
3628	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	Government had earlier cut its export growth forecast to six percent this year due to the global financial crisis.
3629	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	Electronics fell 2.7 percent 2.59 billion dollars in September, although the sector still accounted for 58 percent of total shipments.
3630	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	However, between January and September, electronics exports fell 1.8 percent to 22.82 billion dollars.
3631	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	Apparel and clothing accessories were the second biggest export, accounting for 4.1 percent share of shipments but sales were down 5.9 percent to 181.22 million dollars.
3632	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	Sales of cathodes and sections of cathodes of refined copper rose 40.4 percent to 178.05 million dollars, while petroleum products rose more than 50 percent to 155.39 million dollars.
3633	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	The United States remained the country's top export destination, with receipts of 806.99 million dollars, accounting for 18.2 percent of the total.

3636	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she created that uses computer play to teach reading.
3637	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for children.
3638	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" launched by Sabi Inc. immerses children in an animated world that they control and shape by using software developed by Microsoft Labs.
3639	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	On-screen boys and girls coax players into helping with missions that involve drawing houses, trees or other objects brought to animated life and into understanding increasingly sophisticated sentences along the way.
3640	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for kids gaming," Johnson said.
3641	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"We wanted to have a fun game fine-tuned to the way children learn," she said.
3642	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity stakes in firms.
3643	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Game-based education is a very exciting concept, and one that we have been interested in for many years," said Microsoft chief research and strategy officer Craig Mundie.
3644	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Sabi consulted learning specialists and brought in engineers that worked on videogames for Microsoft's XBox 360 consoles and computers running the Windows operating system.
3645	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	They set out to create a computer game for children that bolsters reading skills along with creative expression.
3646	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Out of that came Living Ink, which we hope delights children in that what they draw comes to life and they interact with it," Johnson said.
3647	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"What has happened in the edutainment field is games feel like work.
3648	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	It is our goal and passion to establish this category of games that children actually think are fun and, you know what, you happen to start reading."
3649	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Some believe that the education entertainment computer game industry has languished because titles tend to take on the appearance of interactive school assignments based on academic curricula.
3650	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
3651	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market," said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures Program.
3652	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"There aren't that many games today that offer the rich, engaging experience of other games with the educational component.
3653	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	I do think this will resonate with parents, big time."
3654	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Popular cerebrum exercising titles such as Nintendo's "Brain Age" are "Brain candy" aimed at getting adults to keep their minds in shape with daily workouts, according to Johnson.
3655	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Mia Todd, a mother of four whose family tested the game, said her children "experience something new and exciting" each time they play the game.
3656	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's great to see them learning and being creative, and having so much fun at the same time," Todd said.
3657	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Sabi, based near Microsoft's headquarters in the US state of Washington, sees the potential to expand into fun games for teaching children match, science, history and other subjects.

3659	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	As the global financial crisis squeezes once-thriving Chinese manufacturing regions, the fate of people like Xue Fengqiao looks to figure ever higher on the Chinese leadership's agenda.
3660	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue, 24, and his fiancee migrated from poor Shanxi province to coastal Fujian 14 months ago, dreaming of amassing a nest egg by working factory jobs.
3661	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But both were laid off last month, joining the swelling ranks of Chinese workers cut adrift by the crisis, and who now pose a looming stability problem for China's leaders.
3662	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We really don't know what to do.
3663	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We can't go home but there are fewer jobs here and they don't pay enough," said Xue, sitting dejectedly in a government jobs centre crowded with anxious unemployed workers.
3664	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue was let go by a machinery factory in this industrial town as foreign orders dried up.
3665	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"It's even worse in other places.
3666	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Everyone we know is desperate," he said.
3667	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	China's ruling Communist Party already grapples with thousands of violent public outbursts each year by marginalised people in society.
3668	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	And experts warn the problem could spike as more of China's estimated 200 million rural migrant workers lose their jobs.
3669	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Layoffs had already been growing as Chinese manufacturers retooled in recent years for higher-value products, said Constance Thomas, the International Labour Organisation's China director.
3670	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the ILO expects "at least several million" new jobless due to the global crisis.
3671	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"That has to be any leader's greatest fear -- to have a large percentage of their population unemployed, without income, without security.
3672	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Clearly, measures have to be taken to ensure that doesn't happen," Thomas said.
3673	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	An estimated 30 million workers lost jobs from 1996-2004 as the government restructured state-owned companies, causing widespread protests and contributing to the masses of migrant workers today.
3674	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	This time, authorities have even less control over the process, said Willy Lam, a veteran China-watcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
3675	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"Last time, the government could slow down layoffs if needed.
3676	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But now global forces are at work.
3677	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The leadership is very worried," he said.
3678	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The government this month announced a 586-billion-dollar package to counter the export pain with infrastructure and other projects that will create jobs.
3679	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The trouble has been most acute in southern Guangdong province, China's manufacturing heartland, where one-fifth of factories in major cities are expected to close by January alone, according to industry estimates.
3680	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Thousands of workers have gathered outside shuttered factories there, demanding unpaid wages, forcing local authorities to intervene.
3681	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the pain is now spreading up the coast to places such as Tongan.
3682	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Gao Fengxiang, 42, came from central China's Hunan province in February to a factory job here.
3683	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Three weeks ago he was laid off and his employer and government officials have denied him required unemployment and medical insurance, he said.
3684	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We have been cheated.
3685	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	They lied to us," Gao said, his voice rising in the Tongan labour office as fellow migrants murmured in agreement.
3686	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The shabby office is packed with jobless workers checking job advertisements offering 1,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan (about 175 to 370 dollars) -- about 50 percent less than earlier this year, Gao said.
3687	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"None of the jobs pay enough.
3688	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We're abandoned," he said.
3689	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The ILO's Thomas said China was ramping up re-training programmes and addressing holes in the social safety net.
3690	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	She expects big infrastructure projects to absorb many workers soon.
3691	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But far more is needed, given the problem's scale, she said.
3692	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, many workers are giving up and heading home, according to statistics showing increased rail traffic from manufacturing regions.
3693	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Lam called that "disturbing".
3694	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"This hasn't happened before.
3695	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	After they return to Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei or wherever, they are unlikely to find work there.
3696	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	So we may see more rural disturbances," he said.

3700	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Malaysia's Penang island, world-renowned for its architecture and culture, could lose its UNESCO world heritage listing if four new high-rise hotels are built in its capital, reports said Thursday.
3701	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng told the New Straits Times his government was in a bind as the buildings exceed the 15-metre (49-foot) maximum UNESCO height guidelines but were approved by a previous government before heritage status was granted.
3702	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	"We cannot afford to call off the projects as the developers will take legal action against the local authorities so we must face the reality of losing the UNESCO status," Lim was quoted by the paper as saying.
3703	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	The chief minister said the state government would discuss the matter with the Culture, Arts and Heritage ministry to find a solution.
3704	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	UNESCO's regional adviser Richard Engelhardt told the Star Daily the state government had no choice but to adhere to the World Heritage Committee (WHC) guidelines.
3705	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	"When the status is approved, the guidelines trump all previous existing regulations," he told the paper, adding: "Why would you apply for the status if there was no intention of following the guidelines?"
3706	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Georgetown along with the port city of Malacca were awarded heritage status in July after years of waiting for recognition.
3707	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Penang's capital was honoured for its colonial-era pre-World War II buildings.

3743	AFP_ENG_20081210.0089.LDC2009T13	Baseball was voted out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), in part because the US league would not shut down for the Games and instead established the Classic as its sport's global showcase.

3758	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	Russian-British oil joint venture TNK-BP said Thursday its capital expenditure in 2009 would be 3.3 billion dollars, compared with a figure of 4.4 billion dollars the year earlier.

3760	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"In 2009 the company plans to produce 600 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year," it added.
3761	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	A company spokesperson confirmed that capital expenditure in 2008 had been 4.4 billion dollars.
3762	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	The meeting of the board of directors of TNK-BP Limited -- the holding company for the TNK-BP group -- came after an accord that ended months of wrangling between its shareholders over control of the firm.
3763	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	It said that for the full year 2008 it remained on track to deliver its best financial performance since the company's creation despite poor market conditions in the fourth quarter.

3771	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	A South African court Friday rejected the ruling party's legal challenge to the name of a breakaway faction, clearing a hurdle for defectors from the African National Congress to form a new party.
3772	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	The new party will name itself the Congress of the People, which was also the name of a meeting in 1955 when anti-apartheid activists laid out the defining principles of their movement in a document known as the Freedom Charter.

3775	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	He described the court ruling as a major victory ahead of the party's official launch on Tuesday at a conference in Bloemfontein.
3776	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	The ANC, which has dominated South African politics since apartheid ended, vowed to appeal.
3777	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	"The Congress of the People of 1955 was a watershed moment in the history of our struggle, and should stand as a monument to the determination of the South African people to be free," ANC spokeswoman Jessie Duarte said in a statement.

3783	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince's future hung on a thread on Saturday after his side side suffered a sixth successive Premiership defeat 3-0 to Wigan Athletic managed by former Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce.
3784	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Defeat means that Blackburn - champions in 1996 - are second from bottom of the table and in danger of being relegated for the second time in their Premiership history, haivng been relegated under former Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd.
3785	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Goals from England international Emile Heskey, the outstanding Antonio Valencia and Lee Cattermole wrapped up the three points for Wigan.
3786	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Wigan took the lead in the 12th minute through Heskey, seizing on an excellent cross from Antonio Valencia and flicking it past England goalkeeper Paul Robinson.
3787	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Wigan doubled their lead two minutes later and this time it was Valencia who netted as Robinson failed to clear convincingly and Dutch defender Mario Melchiot headed on to Valencia, who took full advantage without a Rovers player even trying to tackle him.
3788	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Ince sent on fit again David Dunn at the start of the second-half for Morten Gamst Pedersen as he desperately searched for some inspiration and within six minutes Rovers went close to reducing the deficit as Christopher Samba's header went wide of the goal from Australian winger Brett Emerton's cross.
3789	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	However, Wigan went desperately close to making it 3-0 in the 57th minute as leading scorer Amr Zaki unleashed a shot from close on the goal but it went wide.
3790	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Dunn took time to get going after a long lay-off with an Achilles tendon injury but finally produced a shot worthy of Chris Kirkland making a save in the 66th minute.
3791	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	It was Wigan, though, who deservedly extended their lead in the 77th minute as Cattermole drove home from just inside the area following anothe rgood piece of work by the seemingly tireless Valencia.
3792	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Rovers did at the least have the final shot on target with Roque Santa Cruz forcing the excellent Kirkland into a fine save.

3794	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	A reporter who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush during a visit to Baghdad was an isolated attention-seeker who ignored Washington's good work in Iraq, a State Department official said Monday.
3795	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	"There is no way of knowing what the motivation of the individual was -- he was obviously trying to get attention for himself," State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters.
3796	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	"This was one incident and one individual's views, but if you look at the direction we are heading in Iraq now, it's a very, very positive direction and we hope to see that continue," he said.
3797	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	Journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi jumped up as Bush was holding a press conference on Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki and shouted: "It is the farewell kiss, you dog" before throwing two shoes at the US leader, who ducked and missed being hit.
3798	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	The Iraqi government branded Zaidi's actions as "shameful" and demanded an apology from his Cairo-based employer.
3799	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	But elsewhere in the Arab world, Zaidi was praised for showing how Iraqis and other Arabs hate Bush, who ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
3800	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	Wood said the shoe-throwing incident overlooked the good work the United States has carried out in Iraq and did not represent all Iraqis' feelings towards the United States.
3801	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	"If you look at what we have done over the last several years with regard to improving the security situation in Iraq and in terms of helping Iraq along the path of democracy
3802	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	if you look at how President Bush was welcomed by Prime Minister Maliki and others in the Iraqi government, I think it says a lot," he said.
3803	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of Iraqis joined anti-US demonstrations to protest Bush's visit to Iraq, where a deadly insurgency and near civil war in the aftermath of the 2003 US-led invasion have left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead and forced several million from their homes.

3805	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola took the helm on Wednesday of the oil cartel OPEC at a time when plunging crude prices are casting a shadow over the previously glowing prospects of Africa's fastest growing economy.
3806	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	The resurgence of the southern African nation, which was devastated by a 27-year civil war, has been almost entirely dependent on its oil output which accounts for a staggering 90 percent of revenue.
3807	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola is OPEC's newest member, only joining in 2007, and sees its year-long presidency as a chance to forge a new image for a country more usually associated with conflict.
3808	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"For us it's very important to associate with this prestigious institution and for Angola to play a very important role on the price of oil in the context of the financial crisis," said Ambassador Nelson Cosme, director for Africa and the Middle East, at Angola's foreign ministry.
3809	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola has overtaken Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, pumping around two million barrels per day, and is now the biggest supplier to China.
3810	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Months of high oil prices, which hit a peak of 147 dollars a barrel in July, led the ruling party to announce ambitious spending plans ahead of parliamentary elections in September such as building one million new homes.
3811	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	But with price having now slumped to around 45 dollars a barrel, the government has had to revise its 2008 growth forecast from 20 percent to 16 percent and begin to eat into its reserves.
3812	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Economy Minister Manuel Junior said last week that the government may have to rethink its 42 billion dollar spending plans for 2009 if oil prices continue to stagnate.
3813	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Should there be the need for a revision of the state budget due to the drop of the oil price in the world market that will be done next year," Junior said in parliament.
3814	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	This spending plan is essential for the reconstruction of a nation decimated by the civil war which ended in 2002, with 70 percent of the population still living on less than two dollars a day, according to the World Bank.
3815	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	There are also fears that lower oil prices will lead to a slowdown in investment in Angola's oil industry which could have a knock-on effect on training and jobs.
3816	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Salim Abdul, a Luanda-based analyst, said that Angola found itself in the same boat as many countries that were so heavily reliant on oil revenue.
3817	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Many members of OPEC need oil to go up because they have calculated their budgets based on high oil prices," he told AFP.
3818	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"For instance Angola has promised to build one million houses and they have to find the revenues from somewhere to do that.
3819	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	And you see the same things happening in Nigeria and Venezuela for example."
3820	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Speaking before he left Angola for Wednesday's meeting in Oran, Algeria, Angola's oil minister José Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said he expected OPEC to make cuts of around 1.5 to 2 million barrels of oil per day.
3821	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	A formal announcement was expected later after Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Nuaimi said the cartel had agreed to a record cut of two million barrels a day, representing nearly 10 percent of daily output.
3822	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Justino Pinto de Andrade, director of economics at Luanda's Catholic University, said Angola still had every reason to count its blessings as its oil wealth had transformed the country's image from that of a perpetual vicim.
3823	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Angola is a player -- and it's a player because of oil.
3824	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Today if you talk about Angola, you talk about oil," he said.
3825	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Now with the presidency of OPEC, they are going to have more visibility and I hope that this mandate goes well to guarantee a positive image for the governance of Angola."

3827	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's key exports tumbled 17.5 percent in November from a year ago as shipments to the recession-hit United States and Europe fell, the government said Wednesday.
3828	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Last month's drop in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) was worse than the 15.4 percent fall posted in October, and marked the seventh month they have fallen in the city-state's trade-oriented economy, which is already in recession.
3829	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	It was also worse than the average 15 percent slide tipped by analysts in a Dow Jones Newswires poll.
3830	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	NODX was worth 12.06 billion Singapore dollars (7.83 billion US) last month.
3831	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	On a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, key exports declined 2.8 percent in November, said International Enterprise Singapore, the trade promotion agency.
3832	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Total trade fell 10.6 percent last month to 66.6 billion dollars, it said.
3833	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Shipments to Europe plunged 25.6 percent to 1.75 billion dollars while those to the United States dropped 27.4 percent to 1.56 billion dollars, the trade agency said.
3834	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Both destinations are major markets for Singapore.
3835	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Overall NODX shipments to Singapore's 10 biggest markets, including the United States and Europe, declined in November, it said.
3836	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Electronic exports sank 17.3 percent to 4.9 billion dollars last month while non-electronics, which include drugs and petrochemicals, dropped 17.6 percent to 7.1 billion dollars.
3837	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's official growth forecast for 2008 has been slashed to about 2.5 percent, but Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang said the target looks unattainable.
3838	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"Singapore is a very small, open economy and therefore the economy is very volatile and very vulnerable to global conditions," Lim told reporters Tuesday on the sidelines of a regional economic meeting.
3839	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We are looking at a very difficult trade environment... So I am afraid the economy will come in lower than what we expected," he said.
3840	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's economy, valued at 243 billion dollars in 2007, is heavily dependent on external demand which makes it vulnerable to any slip-ups in the global economy.
3841	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	For 2009, the government forecasts the economy could contract by 1.0 percent or grow as much as 2.0 percent.
3842	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Joseph Tan, chief regional economist with Credit Suisse, said Singapore will struggle to meet the high end of the government's 2009 forecast because the external environment will deteriorate further.
3843	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We know for a fact the orders from the US and other developed countries have been bad so it's a matter of time before it starts to affect the trade figures for Asia," said Tan.
3844	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We haven't been able to turn the corner on this financial crisis... I would expect the NODX figures to continue to deteriorate," he said.
3845	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore was the first Asian economy to sink into a recession after two straight quarters of economic contraction, government figures released in October showed.

3857	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	But it was not until megastar Shah Rukh Khan got a "six pack" for his 2007 blockbuster "Om Shanti Om" that muscle tone became a must for aspiring Bollywood actors.

3859	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"I went on high protein and vigorous training to get that kind of look," he said.

3861	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	His new look has won him a legion of new fans, including in the gay community, he added.

3896	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel threatened on Sunday to launch a major offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip as violence simmered around the impoverished territory days after the end of a truce with the Islamists.
3897	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The two frontrunners in the race to become prime minister after a snap election in February both vowed to topple Hamas, which has run Gaza since violently seizing power there in June 2007.
3898	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Militant rocket and mortar fire continued on Sunday, the Israeli army said, reporting that one person was slightly wounded.
3899	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	A Palestinian medic said a woman had been injured in northern Gaza by shrapnel from a tank shell but the military denied firing in the area.

3901	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"Israel must react when it is fired upon, must re-establish its force of dissuasion and stop the rockets."
3902	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the right-wing Likud party which is leading in opinion polls, echoed the sentiment.
3903	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"In the long run, we have no choice but to topple Hamas rule," he was quoted as saying by the Ynet news website as he toured the southern Israeli town of Sderot, which has borne the brunt of militant rocket attacks from Gaza.
3904	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"Right now we have to go from passive response to active assault."
3905	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Senior defence officials said after the weekly cabinet meeting that Israel was preparing to take action to halt the rocket strikes.
3906	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"We are preparing our response to the Hamas threat, with the decision yet to be taken on the timing and the scale," Amos Gilad, a senior adviser to Defence Minister Ehud Barak, told public radio.
3907	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	A senior Israeli defence official told AFP that a major military confrontation in the besieged territory was unavoidable.

3912	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some damage.
3913	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The armed wing of the radical Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is loosely linked to the Fatah movement of president Mahmud Abbas, claimed it was behind the rockets.
3914	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Tensions around Gaza have risen steadily since Friday, when Hamas said it would not renew a six-month truce with Israel that came into effect in June after months of Egyptian mediation.
3915	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Since then, Gaza militants have launched several dozen rockets, causing some damage and slightly wounding a handful of civilians, and Israel has retaliated with air strikes, killing one militant and several other Palestinians.
3916	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Although several Israeli ministers have for weeks been calling for the army to oust the Islamist masters of Gaza, observers say the government is wary of launching a major offensive less than two months before the election for fear it would not be able to score a decisive victory.
3917	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"The politicians aren't in any rush to reach election day with an incomplete military operation and only partial results hanging around their necks," wrote military analyst Alex Fishman in top- selling daily Yediot Aharonot.
3918	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"And worse than that, to be accused of having ordered a military operation just to improve their chances at the ballot box," he said.
3919	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel responded to violence that erupted around Gaza in early November by tightening its blockade of the territory and halting deliveries of humanitarian aid and other basic supplies.
3920	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The over-crowded and aid-dependent land of some 1.5 million people has been subject to an Israeli blockade and repeated raids since 2006, when Hamas won Palestinian elections and later joined in a deadly cross-border raid which saw militants capture an Israeli soldier who remains hostage to this day.

3955	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Bhutto, 54, was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in a gun and suicide attack at a campaign rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, just two months after returning to Pakistan from exile to vie for a third term in power.
3956	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Her shocking death threw the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic nation into chaos, sparking violence and leading to months of political turmoil that ended in September when her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, claimed the presidency.
3957	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"In the tradition of a true Bhutto, she faced certain death rather than abandon her principles or the people," Zardari said in a message to the nation to mark the anniversary.
3958	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"The tyrants and the killers have killed her but they shall never be able to kill her ideas, which drove and inspired a generation to lofty aims," he said, adding that democracy was the only way to fight militancy.

3985	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Two more suspects in China's tainted milk scandal were set to go on trial Tuesday, bringing the number to 17 who are facing court over the nation's worst food safety case in years.
3986	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Brothers Geng Jinping and Geng Jinzhu were scheduled to be tried for making and selling food additives laced with the chemical melamine, the China News Service said.
3987	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	At least six babies in China died this year and 294,000 fell ill after drinking milk laced with melamine, which is normally used to make plastic.
3988	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The chemical was mixed into watered-down milk to make it appear richer in protein, but it caused severe kidney and urinary tract problems in babies who drank contaminated milk powder.
3989	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The Gengs are accused of being "middlemen" who added melamine into milk, which was then sold to Sanlu, the largest Chinese dairy producer to have become embroiled in the scandal.
3990	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Officials at the court in northern Shijiazhuang city refused to comment on the proceedings, but the China News Service said notices of Tuesday's trials were posted at the courthouse.
3991	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	On Monday, nine people suspected of trading or producing the tainted additives went on trial in Shijiazhuang and surrounding districts, while five others were tried on Friday last week.
3992	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	In China, trials often last just one day and verdicts are announced soon after.
3993	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The verdicts in the milk trials will be "announced at an appropriate time," state press reports said, giving no other details.
3994	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The scandal, which emerged in September after initially being covered up, shook the foundations of a Chinese food industry that was already beset by repeated safety problems.
3995	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	It quickly became a major global concern after contaminated Chinese milk products were found abroad, leading to recalls around the world.
3996	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The former head of the Sanlu Group, Tian Wenhua, is set to go on trial in Shijiazhuang on Wednesday with three other top company officials.
3997	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The group was once one of China's leading dairy producers but last week filed for bankruptcy due to the losses it incurred over the scandal.
3998	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Lawyers seeking to file lawsuits against the company have said Tian could be facing a long jail term or even the death penalty.

4000	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Oil prices ended the year on a calm note Wednesday, slightly lower after a tumultuous 2008 which saw prices hit record peaks before plunging to multi-year lows.
4001	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for February delivery, eased 13 cents to 38.90 dollars a barrel after falling 99 cents to 39.03 dollars on Tuesday at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
4002	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Brent North Sea crude for February delivery fell six cents to 40.09 dollars a barrel after shedding 40 cents to 40.15 on Tuesday in London.
4003	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Prices soared in the first half of the year, reaching record highs above 147 dollars a barrel in July, before a sharp global economic downturn slashed world demand for energy and pulled prices sharply lower.
4004	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	New York crude plunged earlier this month to below 33 dollars, its lowest point for almost five years.
4005	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	"The market had a pretty torrid few months, a hell of a lot of uncertainty," said Mark Pervan, senior commodities analyst for ANZ bank in Melbourne.
4006	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Current prices, though, do not reflect actual market conditions, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading.
4007	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	"It is probably not productive to search too deeply for the rationale behind market movements at this time of year because they are generally more expressive of accounting necessities than market sentiment," he said.
4008	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	But some analysts saw an influence from Israel's assault on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
4009	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Israel began a massive bombardment of Hamas targets in Gaza on Saturday in response to ongoing rocket fire from the territory, fuelling fears of wider tensions in the oil- rich Middle East,
4010	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Pervan said traders were using the fighting as an excuse to buy on weakness in oil prices in an oversold market.
4011	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	With recession curbing the world's appetite for energy, analysts say, prices risk slumping further in 2009.
4012	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Pervan said he expected prices to fall a little lower in January before bottoming out in February and improving in March or April.
4013	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	"There is no quick fix, quick recovery in the near term," Pervan said, referring to the global economic slump.

4016	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In an unprecedented move, the Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas under house arrest.
4017	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
4018	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In response to the attack, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would crack down on the militants.
4019	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed Yassin's home.
4020	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Motorists were stopped and questioned.
4021	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Policemen opened trunks and aimed flashlights at passengers.
4022	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
4023	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced.
4024	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	It marked Arafat's first open confrontation with the quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
4025	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In the past, the Palestinian leader has detained lower-level Hamas officials from time to time.
4026	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	However, he never touched Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly bloody showdown with the militants.
4027	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from leaving his home.
4028	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	The man said Yassin's first appointment outside his home was Friday morning and that he had not planned to go out before then.
4029	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Arafat also ordered the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists.
4030	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Two senior members, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ismail Hanieh, were among those detained.

4032	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	JERUSALEM (AP)
4033	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Israel's Labor Party members chose a relative newcomer to national politics, former general Amram Mitzna, as their leader Tuesday to challenge Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Likud in January elections, an exit poll showed.
4034	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The poll gave Mitzna, the dovish mayor of the coastal city of Haifa, 57 percent of the vote, compared to 35 for the current Labor Party leader, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.
4035	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Legislator Haim Ramon was a distant third with 8 percent, the poll of 1,000 Labor Party members showed.
4036	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	While surveys had indicated Mitzna would win the primary, polls also point to Sharon's hawkish Likud party winning the largest number of seats in Jan. 28 general elections, benefitting from the Israeli public's shift to the right after two years of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
4037	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said Tuesday that if elected prime minister, he would reverse Sharon's course by withdrawing unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and negotiating with any Palestinian leadership. ''
4038	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The Labor Party is embarking on a new path to present the Israeli public a real alternative,'' he said at his headquarters after initial results were announced.
4039	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Addressing supporters at Labor Party headquarters in Tel Aviv early Wednesday, Ben-Eliezer conceded defeat but said he would keep his supporters together, hinting that he would continue to challenge Mitzna's supremacy from inside the party.
4040	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	He said Mitzna called him, and Ben-Eliezer pledged the Mitzna his support in the election campaign.
4041	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ben-Eliezer's reputation among many Labor supporters was tarnished by his stint as defense minister in Sharon's ``national unity'' government.
4042	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	During his 20-month tenure, Ben-Eliezer oversaw military strikes against Palestinian militants, and when he resigned last month, soldiers were reoccupying many Palestinian towns.
4043	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``The voters are saying we want a different leadership and (Ben- Eliezer) lost because he has been a party of the leadership for the past 20 months,'' said political commentator Akiva Eldar.
4044	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said the election was an internal Israeli matter. ''
4045	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	We are concerned to find leaders who are committed to work with us for peace,'' he said, ''therefore we welcome any Israeli leader who is going to be committed to make peace with us and work according to the signed agreements.''
4046	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ronnie Milo, a former Likud Cabinet minister, said the outcome would only help Likud in January since the dovish Mitzna would alienate centrist voters.
4047	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``I think the outcome is excellent for the Likud,'' he said.
4048	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Weizman Shiri, a Ben-Eliezer backer, confronted leading party dove Yossi Beilin on television, accusing Beilin, a key Mitzna backer, of destroying the party by moving it to the left.
4049	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	About 120,000 registered Labor members were eligible to vote and Israeli media said turnout was about 55 percent just before polls closed.
4050	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The actual vote was expected to be trickle into party headquarters in Tel Aviv in the course of the evening.
4051	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Sharon called an early election at the beginning of the month after Labor left the government in a fight over funding for Jewish settlements.
4052	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Sharon is currently battling Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Likud leadership, which will be decided in a primary next week.
4053	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	In 1996, 1999 and 2001 Israel held direct elections for prime minister _ but that system has now reverted to the past parliamentary one in which the prime minister is the party leader able to muster a majority in the 120-member Knesset.
4054	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Likud leads the hawkish bloc of parties, and Labor the dovish one.
4055	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna, 57, was already looking ahead to January's election Tuesday and his top priorities in office, saying he would reverse Sharon's policy and unilaterally withdraw soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip, the crowded coastal strip where about 5,000 Jewish settlers live among more than 1 million Palestinians.
4056	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``There's no reason in the world for us to be in the Gaza Strip,'' he said in an interview Tuesday morning as he toured party branches in the Tel Aviv area.
4057	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``We will put our forces around Gaza, around the fence, protecting Israel.''
4058	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said a Gaza withdrawal wouldn't depend on negotiations with the Palestinians, but that he also intended to resume talks without conditions.
4059	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Peace talks collapsed nearly two years ago, and Sharon has refused to resume negotiations without a cessation of violence and has sought to marginalize Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
4060	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The bearded Mitzna said that if he became convinced that no agreement with the Palestinians was possible, he would pull out unilaterally from parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
4061	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Jewish settlements in areas evacuated by Israel would be uprooted.
4062	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians were looking for a Labor leader, and an Israeli government, that followed in the footsteps of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist Israeli Jew who opposed Rabin's peace efforts and the negotiations with Arafat.
4063	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``We would like to see a government that offers the Israeli people an alternative to war and to aggression,'' Shaath said.
4064	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The Israeli public has veered to the right following the collapse of peace talks championed by Labor and more than two years of Israeli- Palestinian fighting, and polls indicate Sharon's Likud would reap the benefits in general elections.
4065	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna acknowledged he might lose in January, but said his election as party leader would give Labor a stronger showing in parliament that would allow it to be a ``fighting opposition'' if it didn't win office.
4066	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ben-Eliezer had said his appeal among more hawkish voters made him the better challenger to Likud since Mitzna would ``take us further to the left and keep us as the opposition for a long time.''
4067	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ramon told voters to cast their ballot for the person who will ``present a real alternative of hope to Sharon's government of failure.''
4068	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said he wouldn't join a new unity government under the same formula that Labor joined Likud in the past, but said he would consider a coalition if Likud accepts his positions on disengaging from the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling settlements.
4069	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``If we can make unity around separation from the Palestinians, OK.
4070	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	But to go back to the Likud government of 2001-2002, no way in the world,'' he said.

4074	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Rescuers kept up their search Wednesday for more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in bad weather, holding out hope that people could still be found alive four days after the disaster.
4075	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	At least 212 people have been rescued so far, most of them plucked from life-rafts or clinging on to debris, but some 400 remain missing, said Navy Col. Jan Simamora, the head of the search and rescue mission.
4076	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	The survivors over the last 24 hours had drifted several hundred kilometers (miles) from where the Senopati Nusantara sank just before midnight Friday after being pounded by waves for 10 hours during a violent storm, Simamora said.
4077	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	"We are trying our utmost to find more," Simamora told The Associated Press.
4078	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	"We still hope that those in lifeboats are still alive."
4079	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	People in life-rafts or holding on to some form of buoyancy aid can survive for days in Indonesia's warm tropical waters.
4080	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Simamora said that 12 bodies have recovered.
4081	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Officials have reported seeing some bodies in the ocean, while at least two survivors said that many of the victims were trapped in the ship when it sank.
4082	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Relatives of the missing have flocked to hospitals and ports along Java's coast, hoping their loved ones may turn up alive.

4084	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people.

4087	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-01-05 12:38:04 UTC
4088	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists in the Netherlands have uncovered what they believe is part of the military road that marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire from the middle of the first century A.D.
4089	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Train company Prorail made the initial discovery during preparations to add extra rail lines in the city of Houten, 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Utrecht.
4090	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	"It's in very good condition," said Houten city spokeswoman Marloes van Kessel.
4091	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and Prorail will complete an excavation of a short stretch in the coming weeks, and carry out exploratory digs to determine the further route of the road, the city said in a statement.
4092	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Excavations of parts of the road, known as the "limes," are ongoing in other European countries and the U.N. is considering declaring it a world heritage site.
4093	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Only traces of the Dutch road, which generally followed branches of the Rhine river east to Germany, have been preserved.
4094	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Although the limes' course is known from ancient maps, archaeologists have been unable to locate it south of Utrecht and the stretch found in Houten is believed to have connected two forts: Fectio, modern Vechten, and Traiectum, modern Utrecht.
4095	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Romans first entered this part of the Netherlands under Julius Caesar in the year 53 B.C.
4096	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Fectio was established around 9 A.D., but Utrecht was not built until 47 A.D., as Romans fought German tribes for control of the area, including trade on the river -- and built full-fledged roads, good for rapid movement of troops.
4097	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists have yet to determine a date for the road, which the city said is built on a sloping mound of sand and clay, interspersed with layers of gravel.
4098	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	It was flanked by drainage channels and has wooden poles for reinforcement.

4113	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-01-06 05:54:25 UTC
4114	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Eleonore Schoenfeld, a renowned cellist and music professor best known as half of the Schoenfeld Duo with her violinist sister Alice, has died, the University of Southern California said.
4115	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	She was 81.
4116	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Eleonore and Alice Schoenfeld lived, worked and played music together from childhood until Eleonore's death Jan. 1 of a heart attack in the home they shared in La Canada Flintridge, California.
4117	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Neither married nor had children.
4118	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Alice remains on the faculty at USC's Thornton School of Music, where the sisters had been professors for nearly 50 years.
4119	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Eleonore Schoenfeld was teaching and serving as head of the school's strings department at the time of her death.
4120	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Born in Slovenia to a Russian mother and Polish father, Eleonore Schoenfeld studied ballet before switching to the cello at age 11.
4121	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	The older Alice had already begun studying violin.
4122	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	The two performed around Europe as child prodigies and already had a flourishing adult career before moving to Los Angeles in 1952.
4123	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	Eleonore Schoenfeld later had her own performing career in addition to her better-known work with her sister, playing as a soloist with orchestras on four continents.
4124	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	"To follow Eleonore's career is like a portrait of music making and teaching in the 20th century," Robert Cutietta, dean of the Thornton School of Music, said Friday in a statement.
4125	APW_ENG_20070106.0172.LDC2009T13	"She was not only a legendary figure in the Thornton School and Los Angeles, where she helped the classical music scene mature and prosper in the years following World War II, but her reputation spread throughout the world."

4128	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-01-11 00:18:54 UTC
4129	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	Keith Richards, who inspired Johnny Depp's natty-haired pirate in "Pirates of the Caribbean," will both have a role in the film's third installment.
4130	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	"Pirates" producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas that Richards will appear in the upcoming sequel "Pirates of the Caribbean: At the World's End," reports the trade paper Daily Variety.
4131	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	The announcement ends years of rumors about the Rolling Stones guitarist's potential involvement in the popular swashbuckling franchise.
4132	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	Depp once told The Associated Press his portrayal of loopy pirate Jack Sparrow in 2003's mega hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" and last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is based on a "part rock-star, Keith Richards-kind-of-guy."
4133	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	Richards has long been known for his hard partying ways and wild, beaded hair.
4134	APW_ENG_20070111.0059.LDC2009T13	No other details about his film character were announced.

4137	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	WATERTON LAKES NATIONAL PARK, Alberta 2007-01-11 01:08:52 UTC
4138	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	My dilemma: Should I trudge through shin-deep snow to the side door at the Kilmorey Lodge library?
4139	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Or should I use the front door, shooing away the doe and her fawn that have taken shelter there from the falling snow?
4140	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	I opt for the library door.
4141	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The deer, after all, are one reason we chose this isolated lodge in the almost-deserted village of Waterton Lakes in the Canadian Rockies.
4142	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This is their home
4143	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	we are merely visitors.
4144	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	In summer, Waterton Lakes National Park is a popular mountain destination for Canadian vacationers, smaller and less crowded than the better known Banff and Jasper national parks to the north.
4145	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It also receives thousands of visitors who come north across the U.S. border as part of their visit to Glacier National Park, which abuts it.
4146	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Together, they form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
4147	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But in winter, Glacier is essentially shut down.
4148	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Its hotels and restaurants are closed and boarded up, its high mountain roads buried by deep, drifting snow.
4149	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The border crossing that is the summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until summer.
4150	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton Lakes, at the core of the Canadian park, comes close to doing the same.
4151	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The grocery store and the gas station are boarded up
4152	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	so is the fudge shop, the espresso bar and the ice cream parlor.
4153	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The summer population of more than 2,000 shrinks to perhaps 100, many of them park staff.
4154	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And even many residents in nearby Montana assume Waterton has joined Glacier in winter slumber.
4155	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make the offseason trek.
4156	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We are here this weekend because the Kilmorey Lodge tops our list of places where we most want to be snowed in.
4157	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Our cross-country skis are strapped on the car, and our snowshoes are in the trunk.
4158	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We seek a blend of adventure and solitude, but also a comfortable bed, a warm fire, and gourmet meals served by cheerful and attentive staff.
4159	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Kilmorey offers it all.
4160	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Adventure isn't far away.
4161	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton plows a road eight miles (13 kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the Rockies.
4162	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	From there the remaining two miles (three kilometers) of unplowed road lead cross-country skiers or snowshoers to Cameron Lake, nestled in a cirque at 5,450 feet (1,660 meters) hard against the Continental Divide.
4163	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is one of the easiest and safest ways for winter visitors to view the high backcountry of the Canadian Rockies in winter.
4164	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers.
4165	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And all around are forest and mountains, inviting explorers on snowshoes.
4166	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Back down in the townsite is Cameron Falls, a spectacular waterfall on the edge of town that in winter is an easy destination for skiers who want an adventure a bit short of true wilderness.
4167	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of trees near the Kilmorey.
4168	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	A small herd of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep also frequents the townsite.
4169	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Lucky visitors may even catch a glimpse of a mountain lion, searching for winter prey.
4170	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating this time of year and pose no threat.
4171	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895.
4172	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	In 1910, it became forever linked to its giant neighbor to the south -- Glacier Park is eight times bigger in area -- when James Hill, president of the Great Northern Railway in the U.S., decided to make Glacier and Waterton "the playground of the Northwest" with a network of hotels, camps, and chalets targeting wealthy tourists who would travel on his railroad.
4173	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others in Glacier park.
4174	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The Prince of Wales Inn, resembling a giant alpine chalet, opened in 1927.
4175	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It still overlooks the village of Waterton, and staying there is a highlight for many summer visitors.
4176	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is closed in winter, and few even venture there because of the fierce and frigid winds that can howl down Upper Waterton Lake.
4177	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Those that do visit the Prince of Wales can see the thick steel cables that literally keep the huge hotel from blowing away.
4178	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
4179	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It makes for a pleasant evening stroll through the snow around the shore of the partially iced-over Emerald Bay, listening to the honking of hundreds of Canada geese.
4180	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Evening comes early in winter, and the glow from the lodge windows is an invitation.
4181	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Just off the lobby is a small, cheery pub where we can sit by the fireplace and look out over the snowy wilderness.
4182	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	As in many old inns, the rooms are each unique and range from cozy to spacious.
4183	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But all have antique furniture, plump mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and sleep late.
4184	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The rooms have no televisions, telephones or dataports, and there is no cell phone service
4185	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	this is not the place for such intrusions.
4186	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Dining at Kilmorey is a treat
4187	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	a list of Canadian restaurant awards over the last few years fills a half page of the guest directory, and plaques fill a wall in the Lamp Post dining room.
4188	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
4189	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This night we opt for an appetizer of black tiger prawns sauteed with maple-infused Canadian whisky and a hint of crushed garlic.
4190	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	For a main course we choose pescatorie -- scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab, calamari, cod and prawns sauteed with garlic, Italian herbs and onion and finished with sauvignon blanc and cream, then tossed with linguine.
4191	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood- burning fireplace.
4192	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	You can choose to take your coffee and dessert here after dinner.
4193	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But it's always a quiet refuge, the perfect place to curl up with a good book, listen to the crackle of the fire and watch the softly falling snow deepen outside the door.
4194	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Perhaps we'll be snowed in.
4195	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We can always hope.

4217	APW_ENG_20070111.0221.LDC2009T13	Benjamin said the late morning event on the Cuban side of the American base would include a kilometer-long march to the main gate, and the reading of the names of the nearly 400 men held inside.
4218	APW_ENG_20070111.0221.LDC2009T13	"We should be able to shut down the U.S. prison," Benjamin said before the screening of the movie "The Road to Guantanamo," prompting a standing ovation by several hundred Cubans at the event.
4219	APW_ENG_20070111.0221.LDC2009T13	"Let's dream about closing down the base completely."
4220	APW_ENG_20070111.0221.LDC2009T13	Residents of Guantanamo largely resent the presence of the U.S. base, which their government considers a violation of the communist-run nation's sovereignty.

4237	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and several other major companies issued warnings this past week that fourth-quarter results will miss expectations.
4238	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Wall Street barely noticed.
4239	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	For weeks, analysts have said the long period of stellar earnings growth might be over for U.S. companies, that the 18 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth for Standard &amp
4240	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Poor's 500 companies will be replaced by more modest results.
4241	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	But investors remain upbeat as hundreds of companies are set to report results in the next few weeks.
4242	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Shareholders did not go screaming for the exits Friday after AMD, business software maker SAP AG and Murphy's Oil Corp. warned results will miss expectations.
4243	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	In fact, the Dow Jones industrials hit a record close.
4244	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	And analysts say there are signs that companies might have been able to eke out double-digit gains during the last three months of 2006.
4245	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"There is an indication that the overall quarter might turn out to be better than expected," said David Dropsey, a research analyst with Thomson Financial that tracks equities.
4246	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Earnings are still strong coming out of a lot of sectors."
4247	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	For instance, there's an old adage on Wall Street that "as goes Alcoa, goes the market."
4248	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	The world's biggest aluminum maker, which reported its results Wednesday said profits soared 60 percent from a year earlier, and it had a 20 percent jump in revenue that pushed past analysts' expectations.
4249	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	As of Thursday, 31 S&amp
4250	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	P 500 components reported earnings.
4251	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	There were 17 companies that beat expectations, six that met them and eight that reported results below projections.
4252	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That matches the historical averages, Dropsey said.
4253	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Of the 31 companies, those that have beaten expectations have done so by an average of 8 percent.
4254	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	This is still well above the norm of a 3 percent rise, according to Thomson Financial.
4255	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Measuring the pace of profit warnings has also been a good way to judge how the quarter will turn out.
4256	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	As of Thursday, 156 companies pre-announced results -- 37 said they'd be above projections, 26 said they were in line with estimates, and 93 announced they would miss.
4257	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Even adding AMD and other recent warnings, Wall Street is still faring slightly better than it did in the third quarter.
4258	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	During that period, 177 pre-announced -- 53 said they would beat expectations, 23 said they'd be in line, and 101 said they'd miss.
4259	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Although these are extremely early indicators, it suggests the fourth quarter remains on par with the previous quarter.
4260	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Although many on Wall Street don't expect profit growth to hit the 22 percent level seen in the S&amp
4261	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	P 500 during the third quarter, it is still expected to blow past the historical average of 7.6 percent.
4262	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Portfolio managers say what has come out so far hasn't been significantly negative or positive, and that double-digit growth is still achievable.
4263	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"I'd be more concerned if you saw multiple warnings from the same industry," said Matt Kelmon, portfolio manager of the Kelmoore Strategy Funds.
4264	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Every quarter for the past 18 quarters we've been waiting for this earnings slowdown, and it's just never come.
4265	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	It might be a headline if it's not double digit, but we're still seeing really strong profits anyway."
4266	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments, said investors aren't shaken by the recent warnings.
4267	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	He still sees resilient corporate earnings on the way.
4268	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"The expectations for profit growth already were ratcheted down, but we're now seeing some leeway in that," he said.
4269	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Even if you have a few of these disappointments like with AMD, that's still not enough to change expectations that profit will decelerate below expectations."

4271	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	P 500, considered to be one of the broadest indicators of how the market as a whole is performing, is an index weighted by how many shares are traded in each company.
4272	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That means the potential for sharp growth in the index as a whole could come from a few key sectors, like financial services stocks, Dropsey said.
4273	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Already, major U.S. investment banks and mutual fund companies that reported in December have shown record-breaking results.
4274	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Property and casualty insurers might also surprise Wall Street because of the quiet hurricane period this year.
4275	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	There's even the possibility of decent earnings coming from the nation's biggest automakers.
4276	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. -- both big members of the index -- could post stronger-than- expected results considering recent restructurings.

4279	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-01-13 12:19:22 UTC
4280	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japanese agricultural officials on Saturday identified the strain of the bird flu virus that caused the deaths of thousands of chickens at a poultry farm in southern Japan as belonging to the broad H5 family.
4281	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	It was not yet clear, however, whether the virus was the H5N1 strain, according to Miyazaki prefectural (state) agricultural official Masao Tanaka.
4282	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	H5N1 has killed 157 people worldwide.
4283	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	At least 2,400 chickens have died since Wednesday at a farm in the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki prefecture (state), and prefectural officials were conducting bird flu tests.
4284	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	By Saturday, the death toll has risen to 3,800, public broadcaster NHK said.
4285	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The National Institute of Animal Health near Tokyo has identified the virus as the type-A influenza of the H5 family and is running DNA tests to determine further details, Tanaka said.
4286	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Further epidemic prevention procedures, including sterilization of the farm, are also under way, he added.
4287	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The confirmation of the virulent H5 virus means all remaining 10,000 breeding and egg-laying chickens raised at the farm must be culled, beginning as early as Sunday, Tanaka said.
4288	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, the virulent H5N1 of bird flu has claimed at least 157 lives worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
4289	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	There has been one confirmed human case involving the H5N1 virus in Japan, but no reported human deaths.
4290	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japan's most recent H5N1 outbreak occurred in Kyoto in 2004.
4291	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japan has had several other outbreaks of less virulent bird flu viruses not harmful to humans in 2005.
4292	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The government has set up a taskforce and ordered nearly 20 poultry farms within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius of the affected operator to halt shipments of eggs and chickens for the time being.
4293	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The Agriculture Ministry also ordered a nationwide inspection of poultry farms to detect any signs of sick birds, and environment officials began a national survey to look into the possibility that a bird flu virus might have been brought by migratory birds from other parts of Asia.
4294	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Miyazaki, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is the nation's largest poultry producing region.

4312	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that President George W. Bush asked the United Nations to increase its presence and role in Iraq but he told the U.S. leader the U.N.'s operations in the country are limited by security concerns.
4313	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban, who took over as U.N. chief on Jan. 1, said the United Nations would, nonetheless, try to increase its role in furthering the International Compact for Iraq, a five-year plan to ensure that Iraq's government has funds to survive and enact key political and economic reforms.
4314	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban spoke to reporters on his return from Washington where he held talks with Bush at the White House on Tuesday and met Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, later in the day and on Wednesday morning.
4315	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	During the meetings, Ban said, he emphasized the importance of "a strong partnership" between the United States and the United Nations in addressing U.N. reform and global challenges.
4316	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	He said he was "very much encouraged" that Bush pledged continued U.S. support and participation "in all areas of U.N. activities," and welcomed the "very strong support and warm reception by Congressional leaders."
4317	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked to explain why he called Bush a "great leader" when talking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday.
4318	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"I'm wondering why you are asking that question," he replied.
4319	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"In diplomacy, it is appropriate to address any head of state or government with due respect and courtesy.
4320	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	I hope you understand these diplomatic practices."
4321	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his response.
4322	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"President Bush wanted to see an increased presence and role of the United Nations in Iraq," Ban said.
4323	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"I told President Bush that ... the U.N. presence and operations in Iraq is actually constrained by the situation on the ground -- I mean the security concerns -- but we will try to continue to participate and increase our role in Iraq, including the International Compact with Iraq," he said.
4324	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan withdrew the U.N.'s international staff from Iraq in 2003 following two attacks on U.N. offices in Baghdad and a spate of attacks on humanitarian workers.
4325	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	The first attack killed the top U.N. envoy in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others.
4326	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	U.N. international staffers started returning in August 2004 and U.N. experts played key roles in helping Iraqis draft a new constitution and prepare for elections, but the numbers on the ground are limited because of increasing insecurity, especially in Baghdad.
4327	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"The United Nations has been and will continue wherever and whenever we can to increase our presence there, but that will be largely constrained by the security concerns," Ban told reporters Wednesday.
4328	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	In Washington on Tuesday, Ban called the situation in the Middle East a "source of grave concern" and said "Iraq and elsewhere needs an urgent attention of the international community."
4329	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"Particularly when it comes to Iraq, the international community should have all possible assistance to help Iraqi government and people to restore peace and stability and recover from economic devastation," he said.
4330	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Relations between the United States and the United Nations reached a low point in early 2003 when the U.N. Security Council refused to authorize a war over Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction.

4344	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday passionately called on the world to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions in its tracks by imposing sanctions on the Tehran regime.
4345	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	"I want to call on the world that didn't stop the Holocaust last time to stop any attempt this time and what needs to be done is divest genocide," he said in an address to the Herzliya conference, a yearly get-together of Israel's political and security elite.
4346	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	Iran says its nuclear program is aimed only at producing energy, but it is widely believed by the West to be developing nuclear weapons.
4347	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	Netanyahu, Israel's current opposition leader, said "voluntary sanctions" could be initiated separately from the U.N. measures against Iran and prove more effective, citing the example of how apartheid South Africa was isolated.
4348	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	"The moment the snowball of voluntary sanctions begins, the pressure on Iran will be immense," he added.
4349	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	Netanyahu has been the leading voice in Israel for taking an aggressive stance against Iran, often comparing the current era of world silence toward Iran to that toward pre-World War II Nazi Germany.

4359	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	The treaty, ratified by most countries, went into effect in 1970.
4360	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	It was largely successful in putting the brakes on the nuclear race, he said, "but nevertheless there was some creeping forward, as a result of which three threshold states appeared, those who were outside the nuclear agreement, India, Pakistan and Israel."
4361	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Levite, who prefaced his remarks by saying they were his own opinion and not an official commission statement, did not specifically refer to any Israeli weapons, although India and Pakistan went on to become declared nuclear powers.
4362	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Contacted by The Associated Press on Monday, Levite said his remarks should not be interpreted as a policy statement nor as an indicator of Israel's past or present nuclear status.
4363	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	"I meant that, in terms of world perception, during that period, some were seen as closer (to a nuclear capacity) and some were further away, I'm not going into it any further than that," he said.
4364	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	"In the context of a 10-minute presentation I was making an analytical observation, not an official statement."
4365	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Israel officially has a policy of "nuclear ambiguity," saying only that it will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East, while refusing to confirm or deny reports that it has hundreds of nuclear bombs and may be the world's six- largest nuclear power.
4366	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert caused a stir last month with a remark he made to a German TV station, which was widely interpreted as confirming Israel has nuclear weapons.
4367	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Olmert said he had been misunderstood.

4369	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	KABUL, Afghanistan 2007-01-26 15:24:04 UTC
4370	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Afghan President Hamid Karzai's wife gave birth to their first child -- a son they named Mirwais, Karzai's spokesman said Friday.
4371	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Mirwais was born Thursday evening in the capital, Kabul, and mother Zeenat Quraishi, and son were doing fine, spokesman Karim Rahimi said.
4372	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	"God gave him a son," Rahimi said.
4373	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	"Karzai prayed for his son to serve the Afghan people."
4374	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Mirwais is 49-year-old Karzai's first child, Rahimi said.
4375	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	News of the birth topped the news bulletin on Afghan state TV Friday.
4376	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	The newscaster congratulated the couple on their newborn son, and thanked the doctors who delivered the baby.
4377	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Karzai and Quraishi, a medical doctor by profession, have rarely been seen together in public in this deeply traditional and male- dominated society, where women's and men's public domains are kept largely separate.
4378	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	The couple got engaged in late 1998 and were married in 1999, according to Karzai's family.
4379	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Quraishi used to work as a doctor in hospitals treating Afghans and also in Afghan refugee camps in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, where she first met Karzai.
4380	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	The son's name echoes that of Mirwais Khan, an 18th century Pashtun ruler of Kandahar, from where Karzai also hails.
4381	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.
4382	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	Mirwais was at the forefront of an 18th century Sunni Pashtun revolt against the Shiite Safavid court, which appointed rulers of Kandahar until then.
4383	APW_ENG_20070126.1104.LDC2009T13	He died peacefully in 1715 and lies in mausoleum outside the city of Kandahar.

4385	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-01-29 11:33:11 UTC
4386	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The European Commission on Monday called for a temporary cut in EU sugar production to avoid surplus sugar stocks.
4387	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The 27 EU nations should cut their sugar production by 2 million tons, or 12 percent, for the 2007-08 production year, EU Farm Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said.
4388	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Part of the quota for that period will either have to counted toward the quota for the following year, or be sold for industrial use, such as bioethanol.
4389	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU governments will study the proposal and decide on a new production ceiling in October, the Commission said in a statement.
4390	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU reformed its sugar subsidy program in 2005, ending the dumping of cheap sugar on the world market.
4391	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The reform has caused job cuts at refineries and forced many farmers out of growing sugar beet and sugar cane.
4392	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Under the old system, production was supported by generous EU subsidies and import tariffs that guaranteed and inflated price for sugar.
4393	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	That will now be phased out.
4394	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU sugar prices are more than three times higher than the global market rate.
4395	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU also pays out export subsidies to get millions of tons of sugar off its market every year.

4398	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	A young Muslim slaps the chief of a Paris maternity ward because the doctor manually examined his wife.
4399	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The case is unusual because it went to court, but the violence is not.
4400	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	A report issued Monday by a government-appointed panel recommended that France adopt a charter to keep religious traditions and beliefs out of its hospitals and other institutions, to avoid cases like that of the 23-year-old Muslim convicted last week.
4401	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Far softer than a 2004 law that banned Muslim head scarves and other "ostentatious" religious signs from public classrooms, the proposed charter is, like the head scarf law, an effort to ensure the secular nature of France.
4402	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Tensions over religious beliefs in French hospitals, prisons and elsewhere have mounted in recent years, particularly as Muslim fundamentalists find a voice.
4403	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	With an estimated 5 million Muslims, Islam is the second religion in France.
4404	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Plans to draw the line on what is considered unacceptable behavior in hospitals, carrying risks for patients, were first raised three years ago during the debate over Muslim head scarves.
4405	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Then-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that hospitals were the next target.
4406	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	In May, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin asked the High Council on Integration to prepare recommendations to ensure secularism in public institutions.
4407	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	It submitted its proposal for a charter on Monday.
4408	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Male doctors, particularly in maternity wards, say they are increasingly subject to insults, even blows, most often by men opposed to nudity or physical contact with their wives and daughters.
4409	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The conviction last week of Fouhad Ben Moussa highlighted the issue.
4410	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	He pulled Jean-Francois Oury, the head of the maternity ward of Robert Debre Hospital in Paris, from a hospital room in September and slapped him after the doctor manually examined his wife, who had hemorrhaged after giving birth, according to court testimony.
4411	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	"In my religion, a man doesn't touch a woman," Ben Moussa screamed, according to the testimony.
4412	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	In court, Ben Moussa, expressing regret, said his real motivation was modesty, not religion.
4413	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Still, he was sentenced to a six-month jail term which can be served in part at home.
4414	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	"I think the Oury case was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Emile Darai, secretary general of the National Congress of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians.
4415	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The group, unusually, issued a statement in October asking, "Do gynecologists and obstetricians now need police protection to practice?"
4416	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The statement affirmed that male and female doctors would treat patients "whatever their sex," and said it was the woman who has freedom "to determine contraception, abortion, sterilization without the opinion of her husband."
4417	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The experts recommending a charter for public institutions measured their words, affirming the rights of patients, but stressing the need for a "balanced approach."
4418	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The report said there was no need to legislate on the issue, but stressed that respect for the functioning of the hospital was vital.
4419	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	It suggested a charter laying out the constitutionally guaranteed principle of secularism be adopted and that pertinent sections be posted at the relevant institutions.
4420	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	In addition, the charter would be distributed at key events, such as the conferring of citizenship on immigrants.

4422	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-01-30 18:29:42 UTC
4423	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Eiffel Tower's 20,000 flashing light bulbs will go dark for five minutes on Thursday evening, hours before scientists and officials publish a long-awaited report about global warming.
4424	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
4425	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a report laying out policy proposals for governments based on the latest research on global warming.
4426	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The top U.N. official for the environment asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday to convene an emergency summit of world leaders aimed at breaking a deadlock over cutting greenhouse gases.
4427	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The impetus for such a world summit is U.S. President George W. Bush's acknowledgment in his Jan. 24 State of the Union speech that climate change needs to be dealt with, and the EU's Jan. 10 proposals for a new European energy policy that stresses the need to slash carbon emissions blamed for global warming, U.N. environment program spokesman Nick Nuttall said.
4428	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"There's a lot of momentum that has being building," Nuttall said.
4429	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"We have a window of opportunity."
4430	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Nuttall said the summit could be held between July and December.
4431	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the conference's host.
4432	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries that marked previous reports.
4433	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report must be unanimously approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can challenge the scientists' wording.
4434	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"The government people determine how things are said, but we (the scientists) determine what is said," said Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the report and director of climate analysis at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.
4435	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
4436	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	One Russian participant said Tuesday that the discussions he observed were more procedural than political.
4437	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Another observer who has taken part in several such conferences, Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace, said, "So far we're running on timetable.
4438	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	But who knows, we've got two more days.
4439	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	If there's any panic, it will be Wednesday night when they realize they've only got a few hours left."
4440	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and sea levels this century.
4441	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report "won't change our scientific basis, but it will make our jobs easier," Steve Sawyer, of Greenpeace, said Tuesday.
4442	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"It is an important and powerful new tool in public debate and policy debate."
4443	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups have long urged governments and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power instead of greenhouse gas-emitting ones like coal and oil.

4448	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-01-31 19:31:01 UTC
4449	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy, left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating concerns about inflation.
4450	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
4451	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
4452	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep easing.
4453	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
4454	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	At the previous four meetings, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed regional bank, had dissented in favor of a further boost in rates.
4455	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, he is not a voting member of the FOMC this year.
4456	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.
4457	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
4458	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday before the Fed announcement, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 2006 as strong consumer spending and an improving trade picture offset severe slowdowns in housing and auto production.
4459	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said, "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."
4460	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
4461	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues followed up that comment by repeating its belief that the panel "judges that some inflation risks remain."
4462	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
4463	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough waters of a severe housing slump.
4464	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a considerable period.
4465	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	And some are worried that there could be rate hikes in the second half of the year if inflation does not slow further.
4466	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed last changed rates back in June when it pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, up to 5.25 percent.
4467	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had nudged rates up by a quarter-point.
4468	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Before the Fed started raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more than four decades.
4469	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

4472	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	President Hugo Chavez dismissed Washington's concerns that Venezuela's democracy is under threat, saying a "dictatorship" led by U.S. President George W. Bush poses a true threat to democracy around the world.
4473	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Condemning the war in Iraq, the Venezuelan leader said that Bush and John Negroponte, a former director of national intelligence who is designated for the No. 2 position in the U.S. State Department, should be tried for "war crimes" committed by the U.S. military across the globe.
4474	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"The two of them are criminals.
4475	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	They should be tried and thrown in prison for the rest of their days," Chavez told a news conference.
4476	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"If he had any dignity, the president of the United States would quit.
4477	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	The U.S. president doesn't have the political or moral capacity to govern," he added.
4478	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Chavez was responding to comments made on Wednesday by Bush, who said he was concerned about Venezuela's democracy.
4479	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"I am concerned about the undermining of democratic institutions.
4480	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	And we're working to help prevent that from happening," Bush said in an interview with Fox News.
4481	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Relations between Caracas and Washington have been tense recently, with U.S. officials accusing Chavez -- a close ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- of becoming increasingly authoritarian and Chavez accusing U.S. officials of scheming against his left-leaning government.
4482	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Last week, Chavez threatened to expel U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield for "meddling" in Venezuela's domestic affairs.
4483	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Brownfield has called for improved relations between the two countries, but said he's ready to leave if the Chavez administration decides to expel him.
4484	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Chavez fiercely denied that his initiative to accelerate changes in broad areas of Venezuelan society through presidential decree, which was approved by the pro-Chavez Congress on Wednesday, would endanger his country's democracy.
4485	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"The people gave me the power I have, and it's within the framework of a constitution," Chavez said.
4486	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Critics have called the measure giving Chavez sweeping powers to legislate as a move toward dictatorship.
4487	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	The law gives Chavez, who is beginning a fresh six-year term, more power than he has ever had in eight years as president, and he plans to use it during the next 18 months to transform this oil-rich South American nation.
4488	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Chavez, a former army lieutenant colonel who was re-elected with 63 percent of the vote in December, also announced that his government would nationalize oil projects in Venezuela's Orinoco River basin by May 1.
4489	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Any foreign oil company that resists the nationalization, under which Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA would take a stake of "no less 60 percent," can leave, Chavez said.
4490	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	The Venezuelan president said the private companies affected -- British Petroleum PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., Total SA and Statoil ASA -- would be given the option to stay on as minority partners in petroleum-rich region.
4491	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure that they're going to accept this because we are going to continue being partners.
4492	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Now, if they aren't in agreement, they are totally free to leave," he said.
4493	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	The government will also use special decree powers to nationalize the electricity industry, he said, including Electricidad de Caracas, an affiliate of the Virginia-based power company AES Corporation.
4494	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"One of the first laws will be the one to nationalize the electricity sector," Chavez said.
4495	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"It was a mistake to leave that sector in the hands of local and foreign owned private sector companies."

4498	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	High levels of cancer-causing gases, apparently released by an oil refinery, on Wednesday triggered a public alarm system in an industrial city near Belgrade.
4499	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Sirens sounded in the morning and overnight in Pancevo, 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the Serbian capital, prompting thousands of residents to remain indoors as air levels of benzene and chlorine soared to 10 times normal levels, officials said.
4500	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Serbia's environment minister Miroslav Nikcevic accused HIP Petrohemija -- Serbia's largest petrochemical plant with annual production of 800,000 tons of gasoline a year -- of releasing the harmful substances into the air.
4501	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	"They were siphoning the benzene in an open area, and the wind was blowing toward Pancevo's downtown," Nikcevic said.
4502	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	"The problem is that the plant's management informed no one about the operation."
4503	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's toxin levels were recorded at 118 micrograms per cubic meter of air, or about 10 times the "normal levels" in Pancevo, Nikcevic said.
4504	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	That has triggered concerns in Pancevo, a city of some 50,000 people, as well as among Belgrade's population of nearly 2 million.
4505	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	The plant was heavily bombarded during the 1999 NATO air attacks on Serbia over the Kosovo conflict, causing leakage and contamination of both the air and land.

4509	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Croatia's former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party, Ivica Racan, was having surgery Monday to remove a cancerous kidney, his spokeswoman said.
4510	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	The surgery is being performed at a clinic in Munich, Germany, said Gordana Grbic.
4511	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Racan, who heads the Social Democrats, the strongest opposition party, announced two weeks ago that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his right shoulder.
4512	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Further checkups showed the primary cancer was on his left kidney and had spread to his shoulder.
4513	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Racan, 62, temporarily withdrew from politics, saying he would think of a possible return after the surgery.
4514	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	His illness and absence could harm the party's prospects in parliamentary elections set for November.
4515	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	The Social Democrats are trailing the ruling Croatian Democratic Party in polls.
4516	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Racan was premier from 2000 to 2003, leading Croatia's first pro- Western governing coalition after the authoritarian and nationalist rule of late President Franjo Tudjman.
4517	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Racan was born in 1944 in a Nazi labor camp in Ebersbach, Germany.
4518	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	In the communist-run former Yugoslavia, he was a Communist, but later transformed his party into a pro-Western, center-left group.

4544	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Relatives back home say Utah gunman Sulejman Talovic's early life in the Balkans was marked by war, poverty and upheaval: the family fled by foot from Serb forces when Talovic was just 4 years old, and his grandfather was killed by a Serb bomb.
4545	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Talovic was just a toddler when the war broke out in Bosnia in 1992.
4546	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Serb troops laid siege to the tiny hamlet of Talovici in northeastern Bosnia, bombing it for a year before finally overrunning the village in March 1993, relatives said Thursday.
4547	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"We were besieged and bombed day and night.
4548	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We couldn't stick our noses out of the house," recalled cousin Redzo Talovic, 59.
4549	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"At first we all hid from the shells, but later we gave up on life, didn't care and started coming out.
4550	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	That's how later the shelling killed 20 people in the village," Rezdo Talovic said.
4551	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sabira Talovic fled on foot with Sulejman, his three sisters and his grandfather, while her husband, Suljo, hid in the mountains with other men from the village, relatives said.
4552	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Many left the village, only a few made it," said Murat Avdic, 54, a friend of the family.
4553	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The mother and children, exhausted, desperate and hungry, made their way the to nearby enclave of Srebrenica -- also besieged, bombed and crowded with starving families like the Talovics.
4554	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	One of the bombs killed Sulejman's grandfather but relatives say despite the conditions, they were a quiet, gentle and caring family.
4555	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Those were really nice people, never argued with anybody about anything.
4556	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	During the war, they shared the little food they had with others," said Sefko Talovic, 59, a distant relative.
4557	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"His father helped other injured people flee when the village fell although he himself was injured too," he said.
4558	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Later that year, Sabira Talovic and the four children were among the displaced rescued by the U.N.
4559	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They made their way to the government-controlled town of Tuzla, impoverished but safe.
4560	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I remember they arrived in 1993 on an overloaded U.N. truck and settled here in an empty house the owner had left," said former neighbor Zijad Cerkic in the Tuzla suburb of Bare.
4561	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"They were very poor, they had lost everything, but they were very nice and quiet people," Cerkic said, recalling the young Sulejman as "a good child, always with a smile on his face."
4562	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sulejman's father, meanwhile, narrowly survived the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Serb forces loyal to then-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
4563	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The massacre of civilians was Europe's worst since World War II.
4564	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The family finally reunited in Tuzla later that year when a peace agreement brought an end to the war.
4565	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	But the accord divided up the country, putting their native Talovici in the Serb-controlled half of the country -- and they did not dare return, relatives said.
4566	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They made their way to Zagreb, Croatia, where they obtained Croatian citizenship.
4567	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	In 1998, they joined family members already living in Utah.
4568	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They created new lives for themselves in Salt Lake City, relatives said.
4569	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I spoke to his father on the phone almost every month since they left to the United States, and he said for the first time they have a decent life, they have a home, jobs and they were happy," said Redzo Talovic.
4570	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Sulejman Talovic -- described by his Utah neighbors as a "loner" who always dressed in black -- opened fire at a Salt Lake City shopping mall, killing five people and wounding four before being shot dead by police.
4571	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The news came as a shock to his extended family back in Talovici.

4580	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Avdic speculated that the teen had been traumatized by what he saw and experienced as a child of war.
4581	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Up to 200,000 people were killed in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, and 1.8 million others lost their homes.

4607	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Attacks in other parts of Iraq pushed the overall death toll to near 30.
4608	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	U.S. forces also reportedly came under attack.
4609	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	They clashed with insurgents north of Baghdad after a suicide bomber apparently tried to break through barriers around a joint U.S.-Iraqi base, area residents told The Associated Press.
4610	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	U.S. military officials said they were looking into the incident.
4611	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The compound was cordoned off by U.S. soldiers.
4612	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Residents said the blast from the failed attack may have ignited fuel storage tanks, but there was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.

4617	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In Mahmoudiya, 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the capital, a car bomb went off among auto repair shops, killing two and wounding two, police said.
4618	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Mahmoudiya is mostly Shiite with Sunnis living in villages around the community and has long been a flashpoint for sectarian violence.
4619	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere in Iraq, a car bomb in Ramadi, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) west of Baghdad, killed at least nine bystanders congregated at a police checkpoint in the aftermath of a failed suicide attack.
4620	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In Duluiyah, a Sunni area about 75 kilometers (45 miles) north of Baghdad, at least four were killed when a bomb-rigged car exploded.
4621	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Police said at least 62 people died Sunday in the attack in the mostly Shiite area of New Baghdad.
4622	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Scores were injured as extremists sent a bloody calling card to officials boasting that militant factions were on the run.
4623	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military announced Monday that a U.S. Marine was killed two days earlier during combat operations in Anbar province, a Sunni insurgent hotspot west of the capital.
4624	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The latest attacks were a sobering reminder of the huge challenges confronting any effort to rattle the well-armed and well-hidden insurgents.
4625	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Just a few hours before the weekend blasts, Lt. Gen. Abboud Qanbar led reporters on a tour of the neighborhood near the marketplace and promised to "chase the terrorists out of Baghdad."
4626	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, the Iraqi spokesman for the plan, Brig. Gen. Qassim Moussawi, said violence had plummeted 80 percent in the capital.
4627	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Nearly 130 people were injured.
4628	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Another person was killed in a car bombing Sunday in the Shiite militia stronghold of Sadr City.
4629	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki condemned the bombing as a desperate act by "terrorists" and "criminals" who sense they are being squeezed.
4630	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	"These crimes confirm the defeat of these perpetrators and their failure in confronting our armed forces, which are determined to cleanse the dens of terrorism," al-Maliki said in a statement.
4631	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the bombings underscore the "increasing desperation felt by criminals" and would only serve to "galvanize Iraqi forces and their coalition partners."
4632	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Sunday was by far the deadliest day since the security sweeps began last week.
4633	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a string of car bombs killed seven civilians on the first full day of the house-to-house searches for weapons and suspected militants.
4634	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-led teams have faced limited direct defiance as they set up checkpoints and comb neighborhoods.
4635	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	But that could change as they move into more volatile sections.
4636	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The next could be Sadr City, a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
4637	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	U.S. soldiers pressed closer to Sadr City and the reception changed noticeably.
4638	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In previous days, Shiite families opened their doors to welcome the troops -- feeling that the American presence would be a buffer against feared attacks from Sunni militia.
4639	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, in areas closer to Sadr City, parents slapped away the candy and lollipops given by American soldiers.
4640	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	"The Baghdad security plan is very important to push Iraq ahead," said Haider al-Obeidi, a parliament member from the Dawa party of the prime minister al-Maliki.
4641	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, borders with Iran and Syria -- shut for three days as the plan got under way -- reopened Sunday.
4642	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	But new and strict rules will apply.
4643	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Moussawi was quoted in the Azzaman newspaper as saying the crossing points to the two nations would be open for only several hours a day and under "intense observation."
4644	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The United States and allies claim Iraqi militants receive aid and supplies from Iran, including parts for lethal roadside bombs targeting U.S. forces.

4646	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In Buhriz, a Sunni-dominated town about 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi soldiers kicked in doors and scoured homes, but most dwellings were eerily empty.
4647	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Soldiers confiscated new Iraqi army uniforms in a building not known to house troops, along with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and AK-47 magazines.
4648	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	There has been growing suspicion that militants have posed as Iraqi soldiers in some attacks and ambushes.
4649	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In another house, medical supplies were scattered about -- saline bottles, IV bags, syringes -- in what soldiers believe was a makeshift aid station for insurgents.

4652	APW_ENG_20070220.0555.LDC2009T13	Spanish construction company ACS' 2006 net profit more than doubled, boosted by the sale of its stake in Inmobiliaria Urbis and strong contributions from other industrial holdings, ACS said Tuesday.

4659	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-02-21 22:04:27 UTC
4660	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	When it comes to supplying the United States with oil, Africa is quietly trumping the Middle East.
4661	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude oil imports from Africa topped supplies from the Middle East in 2006 for the first time in 21 years, recent government data show.
4662	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent, or 1.3 million barrels a day.
4663	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Now, the fractional edge given to African crude oil suppliers underscores a number of market changes and may grow wider in coming years.
4664	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Surging growth from Asia -- led by China, where oil demand is expected to grow 6.2 percent this year -- is drawing huge volumes of Middle East crude.
4665	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. market, output constraints from aging oil fields in Mexico and Venezuela are weighing on imports from those countries.
4666	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude supplies from Africa and the Middle East each accounted for a 22 percent share of U.S. crude imports, but in actual physical supplies, Africa's flow topped the Middle East by 8,000 barrels a day.
4667	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude from Africa, at 2.23 million barrels a day, was the highest since 1979 and a 4.8 percent jump from 2005.
4668	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The 22 percent share -- the biggest in 25 years -- compares with 21 percent last year and a share of less than 13 percent in 2002.
4669	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The volume of U.S. crude imports from the Middle East, at 2.22 million barrels a day, dipped just 20,000 barrels a day on the year, but marks the third straight annual decline.
4670	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The flow of Middle East crude into the United States was at the lowest level since 1998 and the 22 percent share is the slimmest since 1997.
4671	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	"Strong demand growth in Asia is pulling Persian Gulf crude eastward and the new supply from Africa is staying in the Atlantic Basin," said Greg Priddy, global energy analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington, D.C.
4672	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Major producers such as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil exporter -- and other Middle East producers have targeted more volumes to China and India, where they've also built joint ventures to sell petroleum products.
4673	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia saw its third straight decline in crude supply to the U.S. market, with a 1.7 percent dip to 1.42 million barrels a day, the lowest volume since 1999.
4674	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Supplies from other traditional top suppliers Mexico and Venezuela are raising concern, due to declines in output.
4675	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from output-constrained Caracas slumped 8.2 percent.
4676	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	While Venezuela held its fourth-place ranking among U.S. crude suppliers, the volume of 1.139 million barrels a day was the lowest in any year since 1994.
4677	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Oil producers in Africa have picked up the slack.
4678	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from Angola surged 41 percent in December from a year earlier, capping a 12.5 percent full-year gain to a record average of 513,000 barrels a day.
4679	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from Algeria jumped 57 percent to 357,000 barrels a day in 2006, the highest volume since 1980.
4680	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	For the second straight year, crude imports from Chad rose by nearly 30 percent, reaching a high of 95,000 barrels a day in 2006.
4681	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	However, U.S. imports from Nigeria -- Africa's biggest oil producer -- dropped 3.2 percent on the year to 1.043 million barrels a day, the lowest level since 2003 as civil unrest in the oil-producing Delta region disrupted supplies throughout the year.
4682	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Canada remains the top U.S. crude supplier, a title it has held each year since 2004, when it eclipsed Saudi Arabia.
4683	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	In 2006, Canada supplied 1.782 million barrels a day to the United States, the most ever from a single source and a 9.1 percent jump from a year ago.

4688	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Real Madrid midfielder Emerson has denied refusing to appear as a substitute during the Champions League match with Bayern Munich.
4689	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	TV channel Cuatro showed pictures which it said showed Emerson declining to play after being called by Madrid coach Fabio Capello with six minutes remaining of the game at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
4690	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Madrid led the second-round first leg by 3-1 at the time but Bayern midfielder Mark Van Bommel then scored his team's second goal.
4691	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Emerson, who reportedly didn't want to play as he hadn't warmed up on touchline with the rest of his teammates, said he couldn't "understand why this has been said."
4692	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	"It's not true.
4693	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	I'm a professional and I have never refused to play a match and particularly not with Capello, whom I have known for many years and who has known me," Emerson was quoted as saying by sports daily Marca on Thursday.
4694	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	In a similar incident on Feb. 11, FC Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o faced suggestions he had refused to play as a substitute in a league game with Racing Santander.
4695	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	An angry Eto'o responded two days later by railing against coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.
4696	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Emerson, together with defender Fabio Cannavaro, followed Capello in a euro20 million (US$26.2 million) transfer from Juventus to Madrid last July.
4697	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	However, the midfielder has failed to secure a first-team place and has been whistled during matches by some Madrid fans who are unconvinced by his displays

4701	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	A scuffle broke out at a war monument Friday after several Estonian nationalists tried to lay a wreath to victims of Soviet oppression but were confronted by another group.
4702	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	The fight came one day after President Toomas Hendrik Ilves vetoed a law calling for the monument's removal.
4703	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	The monument, dubbed the Bronze Soldier, symbolizes 50 years of Soviet oppression for Estonians -- but for ethnic Russians it represents the defeat of fascist Germany.
4704	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	"Nobody was hurt.
4705	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	Everybody backed off and left their own way," Tallinn police spokesman Harrys Puusepp.
4706	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	He said no arrests were made but a inquiry was launched to determine whether the nationalist group -- the Estonian National Movement -- had violated regulations since they had not registered their protest.
4707	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the Estonian National Movement held a legal demonstration outside the Russian Embassy on Friday to protest at Russia's alleged interference in Estonia's internal affairs.
4708	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	Puusepp said some 10 people took part in the protest.
4709	APW_ENG_20070223.0894.LDC2009T13	Relations between Estonia and Russia have deteriorated over Estonia's intention to remove the Bronze Soldier and a war grave nearby.

4721	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	Officials blamed recent rains and an underground sewage flow from a ruptured main for opening up the sinkhole on Friday, and warned that it could widen.
4722	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	The two bodies were found near the enormous fissure, floating in a river of sewage.
4723	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	The pit emitted foul odors, loud noises and tremors, shaking the surrounding ground.
4724	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	A rush of water could be heard from its depths, and authorities feared it could widen or others could open up.

4734	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	Authorities evacuated nearby homes and cordoned off a 500-meter (500-yard) perimeter around the crater.
4735	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	Police helped residents move out, with some officers carrying refrigerators and televisions on their shoulders while other pushed sofas on makeshift carts.
4736	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	Security officials were on guard for possible looters and to clear the area of onlookers.
4737	APW_ENG_20070224.0104.LDC2009T13	Authorities had apparently suspected something was wrong with the site before the sinkhole appeared.

4746	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-02-25 01:19:04 UTC
4747	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	When a pack of rats invaded a fast food restaurant here, many people were shocked as they watched widely distributed video footage of the dozen twitchy rodents scampering across the eatery's floor.
4748	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	But in a city like New York, businesses that handle food wage a seemingly endless battle against vermin.
4749	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference with the rats caught on tape this week at a joint KFC and Taco Bell restaurant?
4750	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Patrons usually do not see the creatures and certainly not in such large numbers.
4751	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing knowing it.
4752	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	It's another seeing it," said Nicole West, 23, who lives near the restaurant, which was shut down Friday and remained closed.
4753	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Trouble with mice, rats, cockroaches and other pests are not limited to restaurants.
4754	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	State sanitary reports show scores of small markets and prominent area grocery stores have at one point or another dealt with similar problems.
4755	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The city is a tough place," Jeffrey Eisenberg, president of Pest Away Exterminating in Manhattan, said in a recent interview.
4756	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a battle.
4757	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If you look, you're gonna find them."
4758	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	According to the reports, rodents gnaw their way into sacks of cat and dog food, pasta and beef packages and loaves of bread.
4759	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Mice and rat droppings are unearthed in storage and other areas that customers do not see.
4760	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Rat and mice carcasses are not uncommon.
4761	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors once discovered two rodent burrows in one supermarket's dairy cooler.
4762	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors over the years have uncovered rodent-defiled macaroni products, a live rat and a meandering mouse in a fresh corn display.
4763	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Of course, it is the sniveling rat that makes people most squeamish.
4764	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It is disgusting," said Brian O'Keefe, who has frequented the city's KFC fried chicken and Taco Bell Mexican-American restaurants.
4765	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I mean, rats are supposed to be on the outside.
4766	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	And mice are on the inside.
4767	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If there's rats inside you got a real serious problem."
4768	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	It's impossible to estimate how many rats there are in New York, experts say, but one popular belief is that there's one for each of the more than 8 million people in the city.
4769	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Whatever the number, the rats have continued to thrive despite the city spending millions to eradicate them.
4770	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The typical New York rat weighs about 1 pound (45 kilograms) and has a very flexible body, making it easy to squeeze though openings as small as a half inch (little more than a centimeter).
4771	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Each year, a female rat can easily bear dozens of offspring that survive, said Frank Gasperini, a pest-control expert.
4772	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	They sometimes bite people, but mostly, they just eat -- at least one ounce of food every 24 hours, according to Bobby Corrigan, a rat expert.
4773	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	That means few food establishments are immune.
4774	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"Even the most famous restaurants can get rats," Gasperini said.
4775	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The city's health department finds evidence of vermin, especially mice, at various eateries, from Caribbean restaurants to kosher food shops.
4776	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Health inspection scores at chain restaurants depend on the location.
4777	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Jessica Leighton, the city's deputy commissioner of environmental health, said sloppy sanitation can attract rodents.
4778	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The basic message is, you need to remove food sources," she said.
4779	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"In restaurants, rodents are a symptom of poor sanitation."
4780	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Eisenberg, the exterminator, said wiping out vermin is impossible.
4781	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	His company kills about 50,000 rats and 250,000 a mice a year in the city, but it's a war that can't be won -- only managed.
4782	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC-Taco Bell, said the incident was unacceptable and a violation of its high standards.
4783	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The company said construction in the building's basement apparently stirred up the rats.
4784	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, passers-by were still stopping to gawk at the now- notorious fast food joint.
4785	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	West was one of them.
4786	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	She said she'd never eat there again.

4809	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into vaccine trials by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline in Russia that were allegedly conducted on children without parents' permission.
4810	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	The Prosecutor General's office said in a statement dated Monday and posted on its Web site Friday that investigators began the probe at a hospital in Volgograd, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Moscow, after several children who received the vaccines fell ill and parents raised questions.
4811	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	More than 100 children between the ages of one and two were given the vaccines during the trails, which have since been halted, the statement said.

4813	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	They also said parents had been told the vaccines were humanitarian aid.

4837	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2007-03-07 02:18:42 UTC
4838	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	Workers at a northern Malaysian airport cargo complex found 2,400 snakes of a protected species in crates bound for Hong Kong sent by smugglers in Thailand, news reports said Wednesday.
4839	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The banded rat snake -- rarely found in Malaysia and protected under local laws and international wildlife treaties -- is an expensive delicacy in some Asian countries, the New Straits Times and The Star reported.
4840	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	Workers handling cargo at the complex near the Bayan Lepas International Airport in Penang grew suspicious when they heard hissing and "slithering sounds", the Times reported, and alerted wildlife officials.
4841	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The officials found the snakes, worth an estimated 240,000 ringgit (US$68,400

4846	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-03-11 18:42:23 UTC
4847	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Little progress was reported Sunday from the second summit meeting in a month between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
4848	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	A Palestinian participant called it "difficult."
4849	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders met for more than two hours at Olmert's Jerusalem residence and pledged to continue their contacts, prodded by U.S. officials to nurture their fledgling dialogue.
4850	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the only concrete result, an Israeli official said Olmert pledged to keep the vital Karni cargo crossing between Israel and Gaza open for longer hours to allow more goods to enter and exit the seaside territory.
4851	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Karni closed often, citing security threats.
4852	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Larger issues standing in the way of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians -- borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem -- were apparently not even seriously discussed at the summit.
4853	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert said in advance that the talks would be limited to humanitarian issues, reflecting his rejection of the current government headed by the violently anti- Israel Hamas.
4854	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert and Abbas walked into the residence together.
4855	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders, flanked by their aides, sat on opposite sides of a conference table as the talks began.
4856	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert smiled to TV cameras in the room as he exchanged pleasantries with Abbas.
4857	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Negotiator Mohammed Dahlan, who attended the meeting, called the summit "difficult."
4858	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	He said the Palestinians called on Olmert to fulfill his pledge to ease travel restrictions in the West Bank by removing roadblocks, and to release sick and elderly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, but Olmert made no promises.
4859	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed, said Olmert pressed Abbas to halt Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza and arms smuggling from Egypt, and win the release of an Israeli soldier captured in June by Hamas-linked gunmen.
4860	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The official said Abbas hoped the soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, would be freed before the formation of a new Palestinian unity government consisting of Hamas and Abbas' more moderate Fatah movement.
4861	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The power-sharing deal between the two Palestinian rivals, reached last month in the Saudi holy city of Mecca, has cast a shadow on Mideast diplomacy because it does not meet international demands that any Palestinian government renounce violence, recognize Israel and commit to previous peace agreements.
4862	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	While willing to maintain ties with Abbas, Olmert says he will not conduct peace talks with a government that includes Hamas unless the group agrees to meet those demands.
4863	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Under the unity deal, the new government only agrees to "respect" past agreements, falling short of the international conditions.
4864	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Dahlan said the Palestinians told Olmert the unity government is an internal Palestinian matter, according to Dahlan's spokesman.
4865	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Sunday's meeting followed a Feb. 19 summit in Jerusalem that also ended with little progress.
4866	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who attended last month's meeting, had urged the sides to continue talking.
4867	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Abbas has argued the unity deal with Hamas is essential to end months of infighting.
4868	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in internal violence since last May, after Hamas defeated Fatah in legislative elections.
4869	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The unity deal has brought a lull to the Gaza Strip, where the infighting has been concentrated, but tensions remain.
4870	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the most serious flare-up of fighting since the agreement, gunmen from Hamas and Fatah exchanged fire early Sunday in northern Gaza.
4871	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Mohammed Kafarneh, a local Hamas militia leader, was killed and seven people were wounded.
4872	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Hamas vowed revenge.
4873	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Ahead of Sunday's summit, Olmert announced he was ready to "treat seriously" a dormant Saudi initiative calling for a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Arab world in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
4874	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the past, Israel has rejected the plan's call for a full withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
4875	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	It also opposes the plan's implicit endorsement of a large-scale return of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to areas inside Israel.
4876	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The 2002 Saudi initiative is expected to be high on the agenda of a pan-Arab summit in Riyadh later this month.
4877	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The Saudi push comes at a time when many moderate Arab governments view progress on the Palestinian-Israeli issue as a way to lower tensions and to blunt the growing influence of Iran.

4879	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	BONN, Germany 2007-03-13 00:25:20 UTC
4880	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Under pressure from global trade rivals, EU nations were expected to push former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions on Tuesday to complete negotiations on new regional free trade pacts by the end of 2007, deals which aid groups fear could lead to more harm than good.
4881	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over 55 trade development ministers from the European Union and its former colonies are to debate how they will meet an end-of- year World Trade Organization deadline to conclude the controversial market-opening trade talks.
4882	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Regional "economic partnership" trade pacts with the 27-nation EU are supposed to be concluded this year, but the talks have been stalled for months due to market access, good governance and aid levels.
4883	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Many of the 78-poor nation grouping known as the ACP group of former European colonies are also loathe to give up over three decades of dependency on privileged access to EU markets.
4884	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"The timeframe for the conclusion ... by the end of 2007 is tight, but we should make use of it," said Germany's Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who is hosting the talks here at an exclusive resort overlooking the Rhine River valley.
4885	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz and Asha-rose Migiro, the U.N.'s deputy secretary-general were also attending the talks, which were also focusing on how aid donors like the EU and U.N. bodies can help reconstruction efforts in Congo.
4886	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ministers and officials were to debate how to provide energy to the poorest nations in Africa, while making sure the electricity they use come from renewable sources.
4887	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz appealed to the EU ministers at informal dinner talks Monday night that the trade pacts go hand in hand with substantial aid to build up key infrastructure like roads and electrical grids, which are critical for an economy to function.
4888	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"What they need right now is more financial assistance, there are many other things as well but you can't build a private sector without electricity and roads," Wolfowitz said.
4889	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The trade accords foresee gradual market openings in parallel with EU funding for good governance and reforms in developing nations so as to spur trade among them.
4890	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Aid groups however, have derided the negotiations saying the deals threaten to undermine poverty reduction.
4891	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Klaus Schilder from aid group World Economy, Ecology and Development, WEED, said the trade pacts on the table "go beyond what is being negotiated" at world trade talks, and include such areas like investment, services and other business sectors which developing countries do not want to include in the talks.
4892	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over the past month EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel held talks with the six regional groupings negotiating trade pacts with the EU.
4893	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The EU is conducting negotiations with the Caribbean

4895	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	East and Southern Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the Pacific regional grouping.
4896	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The European Commission said all the talks concluded so far that they need to create "the widest possible market access" to the EU's vast market for ACP regions.
4897	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ACP nations are mostly ex-European colonies.
4898	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The EU has promised them a doubling of aid to euro2 billion (US$2.6 billion) by 2010.
4899	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Half is to come from the EU budget, the other half from the 25 EU governments.

4946	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	CAMP PENDLETON, California 2007-03-16 00:00:07 UTC
4947	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	A Marine staff sergeant charged with unpremeditated murder in the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha admitted firing at five unarmed Iraqi men but said in an interview that their killing was justified.
4948	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, 26, spoke publicly for the first time about the events of Nov. 19, 2005, in an interview with the CBS' "60 Minutes," scheduled for broadcast Sunday night.
4949	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's squad.
4950	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	He said they tried to run from the car, instead of obeying an order not to.
4951	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Normally the Iraqis know the drill.
4952	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	If something happens, get down, hands up," Wuterich told CBS.
4953	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"They started to take off, so I shot at them."
4954	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The Washington Post.
4955	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	In January, the newspaper ran a story that said witnesses told investigators that the men did not run away and Wuterich shot them as they stood, unarmed, by the taxi about 10 feet (3 meters) in front of him.
4956	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the interview was filmed in late October somewhere near Camp Pendleton, Wuterich's home base.
4957	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich was charged in December with 13 counts of unpremeditated murder.
4958	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Three other squad members also were charged with unpremeditated murder and four officers were charged with failing to properly investigate or report the killings.
4959	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Tedesco said it is not unusual for a "60 Minutes" story to take months to report before it is broadcast.
4960	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's attorney Neal Puckett did not comment on the CBS interview and declined an Associated Press request to speak to Wuterich.
4961	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Following the taxi shooting, Wuterich said, he was given permission from a superior officer to raid a house suspected to have a sniper inside.
4962	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marines did this using grenades and gunfire, according the CBS News release.
4963	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he knew women and children were killed in that house, but he didn't stop the assault because he saw an open doorway leading toward a second house and believed the sniper had escaped through it.
4964	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"My responsibility as a squad leader is to make sure that none of the rest of my guys died," Wuterich told CBS.
4965	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was sorry women and children died, but he believes he was acting according to how he had been trained.
4966	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Did we know that civilians were in there?
4967	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	No," Wuterich told CBS.
4968	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"We cleared these houses the way they were supposed to be cleared."
4969	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marine sergeant said he regretted the deaths.
4970	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"There is nothing that I can possibly say to make up or make well the deaths of those women and children, and I am absolutely sorry it happened that day," Wuterich told CBS.
4971	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"What I did that day, the decision that I made, I would make those decisions again today.
4972	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Those are decisions that I made in a combat situation and I believe I had to make those decisions."

4974	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-03-19 00:16:04 UTC
4975	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Senior European Union representatives were to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday to prepare the ground for an EU-U.S. summit on April 30 in Washington.
4976	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, along with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner were also expected to discuss issues including the Middle East, Iran's nuclear program and the future status of Kosovo with Rice.
4977	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	The April summit is expected to consider a proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a trade deal that would help eliminate some regulatory barriers hindering companies in the U.S. and EU from doing business with each other.
4978	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Following the meeting with Rice, the three European representatives were to participate in a corporate forum on energy technology research to be chaired by Rice and Steinmeier.
4979	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Ahead of Steinmeier's departure from Germany on Sunday, the German foreign minister suggested that the U.S. plan to build a missile defense system in Europe-- an issue that has been a point of contention -- has merits.
4980	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	But in an opinion piece for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung printed Sunday, Steinmeier said an open dialogue was needed to address concerns from all sides.
4981	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	"Given the strategic nature of such a project, I would advocate proceeding carefully with intensive dialogue with all partners involved, whether directly or indirectly," Steinmeier said.
4982	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Russia has vigorously opposed the idea for the missile program, saying that placing systems in Poland and the Czech Republic which are close to its border could diminish its nuclear deterrent.
4983	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	While the U.S. has tried to allay those concerns with assurances that the deterrent was intended to counteract Iran's developing missile program and the small number of installations would have little effect on Russia's thousands of missiles, Moscow has remained unconvinced and has suggested the deployment could lead to a new arms race or rekindling of the Cold War.
4984	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Steinmeier had previously roiled U.S. officials by suggesting that the United States should have included Russia in discussions on the program.
4985	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have responded that Russia had been consulted repeatedly about the program.

4987	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	YOKOSUKA, Japan 2007-03-20 03:09:44 UTC
4988	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ayano Sasao is defying the conventional wisdom that cars targeted to a niche consumer category like young women are doomed to fail.
4989	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The 18-year-old Japanese hospital worker just bought the Nissan Pino, a toylike minicar just 3.4 meters (11 feet) long with star- stamped upholstery, a hook for a handbag and a chic "milk tea beige" exterior -- although she says she almost went with the pink.
4990	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's so cute.
4991	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	I just love it," she said.
4992	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	To make sure women like Sasao get the message, Nissan Motor Co. launched a merchandise line for Pino, including pink bear-shaped cushions, seat covers with hearts, a CD case that looks like fat red lips, and a colorful cover for a tissue box.
4993	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ironically, Pino isn't even made by Nissan, Japan's third biggest automaker.
4994	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	It's made by Suzuki Motor Inc.
4995	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But under a manufacturing agreement, Nissan packages Suzuki's Alto model differently, with fancier seat fabric, a distinct front design and a hubcap inspired by a snowflake so the wheels appear to sparkle on the road -- all touches to give the car that cute look.
4996	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan had 5,500 orders for the Pino in the first month since it went on sale in January, more than double the company target of 2,500 a month.
4997	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Sasao knew the Alto looked a lot like her Pino and was quite a bit cheaper.
4998	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The Pino starts at about 1 million yen (US$8,600
4999	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro6,500), while the Alto starts at 650,000 yen (US$5,600
5000	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro4,200).
5001	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But she still was willing to spend more -- and take out a six-year auto loan -- for the Pino because she thought it was so much cuter.
5002	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	While models such as sportscars or family minivans target segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they usually don't sell in numbers.
5003	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Toyota Motor Corp. officials often say they don't believe in overly specific marketing tactics, which are apt to backfire for an automaker known for best-sellers like the Camry and Corolla.
5004	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	And in most countries, experts tend to advise against making autos pink or adding other "cute" features to appeal to female drivers partly because that may smack of sexism and turn off women -- except in Japan.
5005	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Here, young women are extremely powerful in setting trends, and the culture of cute is so prevalent grown men aren't embarrassed about dangling little mascots from cell phones.
5006	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Also, Japanese consumers frequently use personal products to show off who they are, often buying designer-brand products to make a statement, said Kazuo Ikegami, marketing expert and professor at Rissho University.
5007	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"Product image is far more important for Japanese consumers than American consumers," Ikegami said.
5008	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"There's a much bigger element of personal identity in Japanese marketing."
5009	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Even the advertising for Pino is tailored to women who are about 20 years old.
5010	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The pamphlet is manga-style, like a Japanese comic book, depicting the story of three young well-dressed women going shopping together, manicuring their nails to match the star- patterns on Pino seats, using aromatherapy oils in the car.
5011	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The TV ads also tell a similar story.
5012	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan marketing manager Miwa Ishii says one goal for Pino is to court young drivers to the Nissan brand with hopes they'll move on to buy more expensive models in the future.
5013	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities -- exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.
5014	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"Rather than talk about the features of a minicar, we thought it's better to talk about how cute it is," she said.
5015	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model.
5016	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	We're starting from zero to build public awareness about it."

5029	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Graeme Smith's 91 and Andrew Hall's three wickets were the highlights of South Africa's seven-wicket win over Scotland in a World Cup Group A match on Tuesday.
5030	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith hit 13 boundaries from 65 balls as South Africa, helped by A.B. de Villiers' 62, overtook Scotland's total of 186-8 with more than 26 overs still to be bowled at Warner Park.
5031	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall had earlier taken 3-50 and Charl Langeveldt 2-48, their figures inflated by a late flurry of shots as Dougie Brown (45), John Blain (23) and Paul Hoffman (18) took Scotland to its best World Cup score.
5032	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith and de Villiers, who hit nine fours and two sixes in 45 balls, shared a 134-run opening stand to set up South Africa's comfortable victory, four days before the group's defining clash with Australia.
5033	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith won the toss and opted to field, with Makhaya Ntini's return for fast bowler Andre Nel the only change to the team that beat the Netherlands by 221 runs on Friday.
5034	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Both teams and match officials, who all wore black arm-bands, lined up on either side of the pitch to observe a minutes' silence as a mark of respect for Bob Woolmer.

5036	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Watts and Haq were watchful early on to take Scotland to 16-0 by the eighth over, but Haq hit Pollock for two fours and Haq cracked a six off Ntini as 15 was added in the next two overs.
5037	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall replaced Ntini in the 12th over and struck on his second ball with Scotland on 35, having Haq caught behind for 13.
5038	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith brought on Langeveldt to replace Pollock and his second change also proved a master-stroke -- Watts (24) nicking his first ball to Smith at slip to leave Scotland on 43-2.
5039	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall collected his second wicket 20 runs later when Gavin Hamilton (4) was caught driving to cover by de Villiers.
5040	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Langeveldt did likewise by bowling McCallum (1) with a yorker and Scotland was 71-4 in the 25th over.
5041	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Five overs later, Colin Smith, who scored 51 against Australia to become the second Scotsman to score a World Cup half-century, played a shot to point and de Villiers' direct hit beat Ryan Watson (31) home.
5042	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith was bowled by a Pollock off-cutter for 15 with Scotland on 113-6 in the 39th over.
5043	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	But Brown put on 50 with Blain inside nine overs after Ryan Watson (31) had earlier set a platform.
5044	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Blain was finally out in the 48th, caught by Justin Kemp at extra-cover off Hall's bowling.
5045	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	South Africa's pursuit started briskly and didn't let up.
5046	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The two openers were never troubled, until de Villiers was caught on the long-off fence by Brown off Glenn Rogers in the 16th over with victory in sight.
5047	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Ashwell Prince was promoted up the order to gain some batting practice, before a heavy rainstorm stopped play at 147-1 for 25 minutes.
5048	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The break didn't help Prince, who was caught by McCallum at short-cover for 21 from Haq's offspin with South Africa on 162.

5053	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-03-20 21:20:14 UTC
5054	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	More than $300 million (euro225.6 million) in previously unpaid insurance claims were awarded to 48,000 Holocaust survivors for harm they suffered during World War II, an international commission said Tuesday.
5055	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims concluded its claims and appeals process after a worldwide outreach campaign began in 1998 to ensure that insurance companies fulfilled their obligations.
5056	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Its review was able to match those survivors submitting claims with more than 70 European insurance companies and businesses.
5057	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	"I fully recognize that no amount of compensation can redress the suffering inflicted during the Holocaust," said Lawrence Eagleburger, who chaired the commission.
5058	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, the panel "has achieved its goal of bringing a small measure of justice to those who have been denied it for so long."

5078	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	DNA tests to identify the father of Anna Nicole Smith's infant daughter may not resolve legal struggles over custody of the girl, a lawyer for Smith's former partner said Wednesday.
5079	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Howard K. Stern, who has been caring for 6-month-old Dannielynn in the Bahamas, was complying with the court ordered tests, but may not relinquish custody even they prove the father is Smith's ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead, attorney James Neavitt said.

5081	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	If Mr. Birkhead's DNA matches, then he can come and say he's the biological father, and then you'll have that court battle," Neavitt told The Associated Press.
5082	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Neavitt did open the possibility of a negotiated settlement if the test proves his client is not the biological father.
5083	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	He said Stern respects Birkhead and that the two men will likely reach an agreement if the Los Angeles-based photographer is proven to be the father.

5123	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	GAINESVILLE, Florida 2007-03-24 14:20:45 UTC
5124	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	University of Florida President Bernie Machen says he was "tremendously disappointed" with the school's Faculty Senate vote to deny former Gov. Jeb Bush an honorary degree.
5125	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	The Senate voted 38-28 Thursday against giving the honorary degree to Bush, who left office in January.
5126	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	"Jeb Bush has been a great friend of the University of Florida," Machen said Friday, adding that the Senate's action is "unheard of."
5127	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	Some faculty expressed concern about Bush's record in higher education.
5128	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	"I really don't feel this is a person who has been a supporter of UF," Kathleen Price, associate dean of library and technology at the school's Levin College of Law, told The Gainesville Sun after the vote.
5129	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	Bush's approval of three new medical schools during his tenure has diluted resources, Price told the newspaper.
5130	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	Bush has also been criticized for his "One Florida" proposal, an initiative that ended race-based admissions programs at state universities.
5131	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	Machen maintains, however, that Bush has benefited the university, such as by providing the funding to attract nationally recognized faculty.
5132	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	Machen also pointed to Bush's First Generation Scholarship program, modeled after a University of Florida effort to help high school students at risk of not making it to college.
5133	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	University officials said they could not recall any precedent for the Senate rejecting the nominees put forth by the Faculty Senate's Honorary Degrees, Distinguished Alumnus Awards and Memorials Committee.
5134	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	The committee determines whether nominees deserve consideration according to standards that include "eminent distinction in scholarship or high distinction in public service."
5135	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	"The committee endorsed him," Machen said.
5136	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	"It is unheard of that a faculty committee would look at candidates, make recommendations and then (those candidates) be overturned by the Senate."
5137	APW_ENG_20070324.0536.LDC2009T13	An e-mail sent to Bush by The Associated Press was not immediately returned.

5139	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-03-24 14:49:06 UTC
5140	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Japan swept the top two places at the World Figure Skating Championships, with Miki Ando taking the title and wonderkid Mao Asada the silver after South Korea's Kim Yu-na fell twice in her final skate.
5141	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Ando, 19, didn't do a much-anticipated quad, but her seven triples to a violin concerto by Mendelssohn gave her a total overall score of 195.09.
5142	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Asada won Saturday's free skating, but was just fifth entering the final event and scored 194.45 for second overall.
5143	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"I didn't think I would end up at the top of the podium," Ando said.
5144	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"So I was very happy to hear I won the gold medal."
5145	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Kim, last year's junior world champion, led after marking a record 71.95 in the short program, but finished third with 186.14 after a disastrous 30 seconds in the middle of her routine.
5146	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Two minutes into her routine, she looked like she had the title.
5147	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	But she then fell on the first jump of what was to be a three- jump combination.
5148	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	She fell again and had another combination ruled scoreless because it was too many.
5149	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Ando's victory is another big skating crown for Japan.
5150	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Shizuka Arakawa won the Olympic title last year and the world title in 2004.
5151	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"I am very happy to have won the title in my home country," Ando said, tears streaming down her face.
5152	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Skating last, after Asada had stirred the crowd with her high score, Ando kept her poise and delivered a solid performance that was good enough to maintain her winning margin.
5153	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The 16-year-old Asada, the world junior champion in 2005, tried a triple axel, but was slightly two-footed on her landing.
5154	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	She also underrotated a combination.
5155	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Under the intense pressure of the home-country expectations, Asada came back powerfully, going through her routine to Hungarian music and ending with a three-jump combination in the final 30 seconds that earned bonus points under the new system.
5156	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	She beat Ando in the free skating 133.13 to 127.11.
5157	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"I was very impressed by myself," Asada said.
5158	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"I love skating at home."
5159	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The audience roared at her every jump, cheering even more than they did later for Ando.
5160	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Kim, skating with a back injury, was clearly disappointed by her meltdown.
5161	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"My condition was worse today.
5162	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	My legs felt heavy.
5163	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	But I had a good season and I am happy with it," she said.
5164	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Kim won the Grand Prix final over Asada and Ando last December.
5165	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Defending champion Kimmie Meissner of the United States was fourth, scoring 180.23.
5166	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Meissner, skating a flamenco routine, had a couple of jumps undervalued.
5167	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"It was not my best.
5168	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	I can do better," Meissner said.
5169	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"So I will regroup and come back next year."
5170	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Last year, Meissner dazzled in the free skating to win after the Olympics as the stars in Turin failed to show up or faltered in the worlds.
5171	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The championships ended with the gold medals spread among four countries.
5172	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	France's Brian Joubert won the men's.
5173	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo won the pairs and Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski of Bulgaria captured the pairs.
5174	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Japan had more medals than any other country, with three.
5175	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Daisuke Takahashi won silver in the men's.

5782	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said Tuesday that Fulton was his choice for an opening partner in the team's first Super 8s outing after a long break, while the West Indies will be turning out to play for the third successive day after its game against Australia went into Wednesday.
5783	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	The West Indies-Australia match was disrupted by showers after the Australian innings of 322 for six, leaving the West Indies batsmen to start their chase Tuesday.

5839	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Danny Jordaan, the CEO of the organizing committee, said crime in South Africa was a concern, but sports events in the country had been relatively incident-free.

5861	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	The protest by +39 Challenge against United Internet Team Germany after a collision that snapped the Italian boat's mast was upheld on Friday.
5862	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	The two boats collided around the windmarker of Wednesday's third fleet race, also causing United Internet Team Germany to lose a rig.
5863	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	A jury ruled United Internet Team Germany didn't avoid contact while performing a maneuver of opposite tack, and then cleared French syndicate Areva after the German boat lodged a protest against it.
5864	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	+39 Challenge was awarded a fifth-place finish in the race, giving the team an extra eight points to move it from 11th to eighth in the Act 13 standings with 17 points from three races.
5865	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	The jury also ruled the Italian syndicate would keep the two bonus points it would have earned for finishing between fifth and eighth in the standings, regardless of its final placing in Act 13.
5866	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	United Internet Team Germany will bear the full costs of the Italian boat's broken mast and has offered to let +39 Challenge use one of its own masts until it's fixed.
5867	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	Both teams would have sailed Thursday if poor weather hadn't suspended the third day of racing.
5868	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	America's Cup defending champion Alinghi leads the Act 13 standings with 33 points, six more than American entry BMW Oracle and Emirates Team New Zealand.

5870	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	VALENCIA, Spain 2007-04-07 17:28:53 UTC
5871	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Defending America's Cup champion Alinghi won the Louis Vuitton Act season championship Saturday after winning the final fleet race of Act 13.
5872	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Alinghi overtook BMW Oracle Racing on the second lap, securing the Swiss team's second championship with a fourth victory in seven races of Act 13.
5873	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Alinghi finished with 78 points, 14 more than two-time season winner Emirates Team New Zealand.
5874	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Mascalzone Latino was the best of the three Italian syndicates, finishing third with 63 points after a third-place finish in the final fleet race.
5875	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	American entry BMW Oracle Racing finished fifth with 57 points -- two less than Luna Rossa of Italy -- after skipper Chris Dickson recovered from a disappointing sixth in the sixth race to lead the USA 87 yacht to second in the final race, its best finish since winning the opener of Act 13.
5876	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Saturday's two fleet races were the last chance for the 11 challengers to race against Alinghi.
5877	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	From April 16-June 11, the challengers begin sailing against each other in a round-robin competition that will determine who advances to race Alinghi in the America's Cup, from June 23 to July 4.
5878	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Act 13 is worth triple points with teams receiving bonus points because Alinghi is not factored into the standings.
5879	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Points are carried into the round-robin stage of the Louis Vuitton Cup which could mean the difference in a tiebreaker for the final places of the semifinals.
5880	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	In the sixth race, Spanish team Desafio Espanol won its first ever fleet race after overtaking Alinghi halfway through the first lap before winning a last lap drag race by a boat length.
5881	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Italy's +39 Challenger was unable to race for the third straight day due to a broken mast.
5882	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	American helmsman Ed Baird steered Alinghi into the lead after tacking the SUI 91 boat to a middle course from the start, with the Spaniards following and the rest of the fleet divided between left and right courses.
5883	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Desafio Espanol helmsman Karol Jablonski crossed ahead of Baird and extended the Spanish lead to 21 seconds after rounding the windmarker, widening the gap to 138 meters (yards) after a gybe left the Swiss boat on starboard.
5884	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Dickson took BMW Oracle Racing to the left-hand course before rounding the far marker and tacking left again on the third lap, a decision that slowed the Americans as they dropped further behind the leaders.
5885	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Alinghi cut into Desafio Espanol's lead around the final marker as the Spaniards had trouble getting the spinnaker out, but the hosts held the course for the victory, a result that helped push them up to sixth in the final standings.
5886	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	Also, the Challenger Commission -- a panel comprising the 11 challengers -- ruled it would not support an amendment to the America's Cup rules that would have allowed +39 Challenger to use one of United Internet Team Germany's masts.
5887	APW_ENG_20070407.0636.LDC2009T13	A jury ruled the Germans were at fault for their collision in Wednesday's third fleet race.

5889	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-04-16 14:42:06 UTC
5890	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The German Defense Ministry said Monday that an incident in which a soldier was told to imagine facing hostile blacks in the Bronx while firing a machine gun was "absolutely unacceptable."
5891	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"This behavior is absolutely unacceptable and contradicts the training standards of the German army," defense ministry spokesman Thomas Raabe said at a news conference.
5892	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	He said the army was investigating the incident, recorded in an Internet video, and would probably complete the inquiry in two to four weeks.
5893	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video -- in which an army instructor tells the soldier to shoot and yell obscenities -- aired on German national television Saturday and prompted calls for an apology by the New York City borough's president.
5894	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video shows an instructor and a soldier in camouflage uniforms in a forest.
5895	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor tells the soldier, "You are in the Bronx.
5896	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A black van is stopping in front of you.
5897	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	Three African-Americans are getting out and they are insulting your mother in the worst ways.
5898	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	... Act."
5899	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The soldier fires his machine gun several times and yells an obscenity several times in English.
5900	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor then tells the soldier to curse even louder.
5901	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The German Defense Ministry said the video was shot in July 2006 at barracks in the northern town of Rendsburg, and that the army has been aware of it since January.
5902	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"We found out about it because a soldier gave his superior a CD on which one could see the images," Raabe said during a news conference Monday.
5903	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video was greeted with indignation in New York, but has drawn only muted reaction in Germany despite following two other incidents that raised concern about training in the German army.
5904	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A group of instructors is now on trial for allegedly abusing recruits, while newspaper photos of German soldiers posing with skulls in Afghanistan caused a stir.
5905	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The Germany army is made up largely of draftees, but increasingly is called on to carry out sensitive overseas peacekeeping missions.
5906	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A headline Monday in the taz newspaper focused on U.S. reaction to the video scandal: "Army Video Horrifies New Yorkers."
5907	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	In an interview with AP Television News, Raabe said the incident was exceptional.
5908	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"In every society, in Germany, in France, in Britain and in the United States something like that happens but I think it is really an isolated case," Raabe said.
5909	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"We have a success story for more than fifty years in our German army and it is really seldom that something like that happens.
5910	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	I think it is not a special German problem," he added.
5911	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	In New York, Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. has called for whoever was responsible to be disciplined.
5912	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"The German government obviously has work to do to correct something that is insidious.
5913	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	... Clearly these folks don't know anything about African-Americans or the Bronx," he said Saturday.
5914	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video vanished from the German myvideo.de Web site but reappeared on youtube.com.

5917	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	CHATHAM, England 2007-04-19 00:22:05 UTC
5918	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In Dickens World, rat-catchers hunt vermin on London's cobbled streets, pickpockets roam the alleys -- and visitors line up for a fun-tastic water ride.
5919	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A new theme park inspired by the work of 19th-century novelist Charles Dickens aims to transform a 70,000 square foot (6,500 square meter) warehouse near London into a teeming -- and family- friendly -- corner of Victorian England.
5920	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Literary purists may balk, but the attraction's backers are confident.
5921	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"Would Dickens approve?
5922	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Yes," said Thelma Grove of the Dickens Fellowship, a global association of the writer's fans.
5923	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"He loved to see people enjoy themselves, and he had a very sharp eye for the latest fad."
5924	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In more than a dozen sprawling novels, from "The Pickwick Papers" to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," Dickens created a rich tapestry of 19th-century England, peopled by struggling workers, aspiring clerks, jaded lawyers, ambitious orphans, rogues, runaways and thieves.
5925	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Still in print after more than a century, the books have inspired numerous film and television adaptations and a popular musical, "Oliver!"
5926	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Dickens World's backers say they are trying to capture that vibrant landscape in their 62 million pound (US$125 million
5927	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro92 million) theme park.
5928	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They insist it is "based on a credible and factual account of Charles Dickens' works and the world in which he lived."
5929	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"You can't Disney-fy Dickens," said managing director Kevin Christie, "because he was better and he was first."
5930	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The indoor attraction includes a central square of cobbled streets and crooked buildings, where staff dressed as pickpockets and serving wenches will mingle with the crowds.
5931	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Visitors who pay the 12.50 pounds (US$25
5932	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro18) admission charge -- 7.50 pounds (US$15
5933	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro11) for children -- will have the chance to see the Ghost of Christmas Past in Ebeneezer Scrooge's haunted house, be hectored by a schoolmaster at Dotheboys Hall -- the dismal school from "Nicholas Nickleby" -- and peer into the fetid cells of notorious Newgate Prison.
5934	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Tourists can also have a meal in the cafeteria, which has resisted the temptation to offer "Please, sir can I have some more?"
5935	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	2-for-1 specials.
5936	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The little ones can play in Fagin's Den, an area for preschoolers named -- alarmingly, some might think -- after the gangmaster of the band of thieves in "Oliver Twist."
5937	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	There may be a whiff of kitsch in the air at Dickens World, but its supporters include some serious Dickens buffs.
5938	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's like a dream come true," said Grove, who acted as an adviser on the project.
5939	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	She helped ensure that everything from the names on the faux shopfronts to the pharmacy offering "syrup of squirrels" was true to the Victorian period.
5940	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"People who don't know their Dickens won't know whether they are authentic or not," she said.
5941	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"But I want to be above criticism."
5942	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	At the moment, Dickens World is a work in progress.
5943	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A planned opening this week was postponed at the last minute until May 25 due to a glitch with the "4D animatronic theater show" about Dickens' life and work.
5944	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	As journalists toured the site Wednesday, hard-hatted construction workers unfurled a banner featuring a Victorian skyline across the front of the hangar-like building in Chatham, 35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of London.
5945	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Promotional literature for Dickens World promises the "sounds and smells" of the 19th century.
5946	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	For now it sounds like a construction site and smells of sawdust and fresh paint.
5947	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be a few weeks, but you can see we're getting there," Christie said.
5948	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	One aspect of the attraction is inarguably authentic -- Dickens' links with this corner of southeast England run deep.
5949	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The writer spent several years of his childhood in Chatham, where his father worked as a clerk at the Royal Navy dockyards, and he returned to the region late in life.
5950	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The nearby marshland was memorably evoked in "Great Expectations."
5951	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Chatham's docks are long closed, and Dickens World -- sandwiched between an outlet mall and a multiplex cinema -- is part of the region's attempt at redevelopment.
5952	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Management and staff alike are embracing the project with enthusiasm.
5953	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's a living experience where you can go back in time," said Eddie Sampson, who plays rat-catcher and "gentle rogue" Ned Fiendish, one of several characters who wander the streets of Dickens World adding Victorian color and dispensing directions to visitors.
5954	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Sampson has taken to his work with gusto, creating an elaborate biography for his character.
5955	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	He says Ned never knew his father, fought at the battle of Waterloo, supplements rat-catching with a bit of housebreaking but has a good heart.
5956	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"I invented the entire story," Sampson said with pride.
5957	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Managers hope the staff's enthusiasm will rub off on visitors.They want Dickens to be thought of as fun.
5958	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Asked for the park's mission statement, Grove quotes the admirable Mr. Sleary from Dickens' "Hard Times": "People must be amused, squire, somehow.
5959	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They can't be always a-working, nor yet they can't be always a-learning."

5971	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	OZARK, Missouri 2007-04-20 15:38:14 UTC
5972	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	A Missouri college fired a geography instructor and filed a report with police after students complained the man had joked about being a suicide bomber.
5973	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	Ozarks Technical Community College spokesman Joel Doepker said several students had complained that the teacher walked into class Wednesday, set his briefcase on a table and said, "I'm a suicide bomber," the Springfield News-Leader reported in its Friday editions.
5974	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	"As to the why, I really don't know.
5975	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	But after the class, several students complained to campus administrators about the comment," Doepker said.
5976	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	The part-time instructor was fired Thursday.
5977	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	The students said the comment was inappropriate after the Virginia Tech massacre this week.
5978	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	Ozark police and the college did not release the teacher's name pending an investigation.
5979	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	The instructor told an investigator "that he did make a comment that he was a suicide bomber to his classroom as a joke, to lighten up the mood as the classroom was preparing for a test," a police statement said.
5980	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	The instructor reportedly felt bad about making the comment after he was informed by at least one student that the comment was inappropriate, according to the news release.
5981	APW_ENG_20070420.1098.LDC2009T13	"Even without the Virginia Tech situation, (the instructor's comments) still would have been cause for termination," Doepker said.

5987	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Italy, Greece and Portugal are still running deficits above the 3 percent level set by rules designed to keep the shared currency stable.
5988	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The countries with higher-than-recommended debt are expected to reduce their budget deficits by at least 0.5 percent of gross domestic product a year, the euro nations said in a statement.
5989	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	This would see most of them reach a medium-term goal of putting their finances on track in 2008 or 2009 -- with 2010 set as the ultimate deadline.
5990	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"They are committed to make full use of the current economic growth and the better-than-expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies," the ministers said.
5991	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Reducing debt more quickly is not required, but EU officials stressed that nations know they must try to avoid past mistakes that saw the euro-zone's two largest economies, Germany and France, repeatedly break the rules with deficits that were too high.
5992	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The euro's high value could be a worry because it makes European exports more expensive to customers in the United States and competing unfavorably with Japanese rivals benefiting from the weak yen.
5993	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said he had heard assurances from both the United States and Japan that they did not want to see their currencies at such lows.
5994	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"We have noted with interest that the secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. authorities have confirmed that a strong dollar was in the interest of the U.S. economy," he said.
5995	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Japan's finance minister and head of the Central Bank told the G-7 meeting in Washington last week that the Japanese exchange rates should reflect the fact that the nation's economy is recovering.
5996	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	But Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos did not see problems on the horizon, saying no one in his export-driven economy -- growing strongly -- had sounded any warnings.
5997	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"I haven't had anybody knocking on my door complaining about the euro rate," he told reporters.
5998	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"The development of the rate has come so gradually to the level where it is now that it hasn't really shocked anybody or the market."
5999	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The euro rose to a two-year high Wednesday but stopped short of hitting its record, even as the British pound reached a 26-year high after breaking the US$2 mark this week.
6000	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The EU's 27 finance ministers settle down to informal talks later Friday, covering a lot of ground by swapping views on what they can do to cut unemployment -- currently at its lowest level in 15 years even though it is nearly twice the U.S rate.
6001	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	They will look at increasing training programs to encourage people to find new jobs as manufacturers move to lower-wage locations elsewhere.
6002	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	They will also talk about their own experiences in reforming tax systems as some try to boost jobs by cutting labor taxes.
6003	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Talks continue Saturday covering ways countries can deal with sales tax fraud and a debate on a German initiative for greater monitoring of hedge funds.

6005	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-04-22 08:16:59 UTC
6006	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday politely turned down an offer by Pakistan's President Gen. Pervez Musharraf to serve as a go-between Israel and the Palestinians.
6007	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	Speaking in a radio interview, Olmert said he preferred to maintain direct contacts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and not depend on an intermediary.
6008	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	"We don't need someone to come from afar in order for me and Abu Mazen to meet," he said, referring to Abbas.
6009	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	Musharraf made the surprise offer Friday in an interview with the Arab satellite station Al-Arabiya.
6010	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	He told the Dubai-based station that he would even be willing to visit the Jewish state to help bring peace to the Middle East.
6011	APW_ENG_20070422.0277.LDC2009T13	Pakistan -- a key ally in the U.S.-led war against terrorism -- has no formal diplomatic ties with Israel.
6012	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	U.S. leader of Sri Lankan terror group is arrested in New York
6013	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-04-25 23:02:04 UTC
6014	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The top U.S. representative of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group designated as a foreign terrorist organization, orchestrated a covert campaign to finance its escalating conflict with military forces in Sri Lanka, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
6015	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Karunakaran Kandasamy, 50, was ordered held without bail in Brooklyn on charges of providing material support to terrorists.
6016	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
6017	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	In the past several years, the Tamil Tigers group has "covertly operated within the United States, drawing on America's financial resources and technological advances to further its war of terror in Sri Lanka and elsewhere," U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf said in a statement.
6018	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Kandasamy's attorney, Charles Hochbaum, argued that as a "political refugee" and U.S. citizen, his client deserved bail.
6019	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Jeffrey Knox countered that, if released, he "certainly has the means to flee the country."
6020	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The arrest was the latest attempt by U.S. authorities to cut off support for the group which, according to court papers, has engaged "in terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings and political assassinations," while fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation's north and east.
6021	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Last year, its emissaries were charged in Brooklyn with conspiring to buy surface-to-air missiles.
6022	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors also alleged the defendants tried to bribe U.S. officials to remove the group from the terrorism list.
6023	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	A defense attorney for one of those defendants said the charges would be vigorously contested.
6024	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	An FBI raid on Kandasamy's office in Queens unearthed evidence that he raised millions of dollars for the Tamil Tigers through a front organization called the World Tamil Coordinating Committee, the court papers said.
6025	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	He took orders from rebel leaders in Sri Lanka, in South Asia, and arranged meetings there with supporters "with backgrounds in engineering, technology, weaponry, medicine and scientific fields," the papers said.
6026	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The Tamil Tigers have fought the Sri Lankan government since 1983, seeking independence from the ethnic Sinhalese-dominated country after decades of discrimination against Tamils.
6027	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The civil war killed at least 65,000 people before a Norwegian- brokered cease-fire was signed in 2002.
6028	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The truce temporarily halted the fighting, but more than 4,000 people have died since late 2005, when violence flared again.
6029	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Violence has increased recently in Sri Lanka as the government pushes to retake rebel-held territory in the east.
6030	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The rebels have struck back with bombings, their first-ever air raid on a government air force base and several attacks at sea.

6032	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD 2007-04-26 07:04:41 UTC
6033	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Two suicide bombers attacked an office of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani, leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, on Thursday, killing three of its guards and wounding five, police said.
6034	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The casualties could have been higher if guards had not opened fire on the two attackers, one in a car followed by another in a truck, forcing them to detonate their explosives at least 50 meters (yards) from the office, police said.
6035	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The attack occurred at about 8 a.m. in Zumar, a town that is 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Mosul, the capital of Ninevah province.
6036	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	It was the second suicide attack this week aimed at the KDP in that area.
6037	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Monday, a suicide car bomber attacked a KDP office in another town near Mosul, which is 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and wounding 20.
6038	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	In a separate attack in Mosul on Monday, suspected insurgents assassinated a local KDP official in a drive-by-shooting, police said.
6039	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Across Iraq on Wednesday, 45 people died in attacks by suspected insurgents or militias, including four police officers who were killed when a suicide bomber struck a police station in Balad Ruz, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
6040	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The city is located in Diyala province, which has seen some of the worst violence recently as mostly Sunni militants are believed to have fled to the area since U.S. and Iraqi troops launched a security crackdown in Baghdad on Feb. 14.
6041	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Two days earlier, a double truck-bombing killed nine U.S. soldiers in the volatile province.
6042	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	An al-Qaida-linked group claimed responsibility for the attack.
6043	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a funeral procession was held in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City for an Iraqi who locals said was killed in an attack by the U.S. Air Force early that morning.
6044	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Associated Press Television News footage showed three large craters in the ground of the commercial area and the windows of some of its stores had been blown out.
6045	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military said it was checking the report, but could not immediately confirm it.
6046	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr joined growing criticism of a 3-mile-long, 12-foot-high (5-kilometer- long, 3 1/2-meter- wide) concrete wall the U.S. military is building in Azamiyah, a Sunni stronghold of Baghdad that has been targeted by mortar and rocket attacks by Shiite militiamen.
6047	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al- Sadr called the wall a "sectarian, racist and unjust" plot by the Americans to divide Iraqis.
6048	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr supporters also demonstrated in Sadr City, chanting "No, no to division."
6049	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Others carried a banner that read, "the building of the Baghdad wall is the beginning of Baghdad's division."
6050	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's Mahdi militia has been blamed for much of the sectarian bloodshed the U.S. says the Azamiyah wall is designed to stop.
6051	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, an al-Sadr aide, Sheik Salah al-Obaidi, told reporters in the Shiite holy city of Najaf that other demonstrations were planned in Baghdad to condemn the wall.
6052	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	He said that if security permits, al-Sadr's followers would like to join Sunni demonstrators in Azamiyah.
6053	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, apparently seeking to shore up his political support, has been trying to make overtures to the Sunni minority while distinguishing between ordinary Sunnis and extremists who target Shiites.
6054	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has said al-Sadr is in neighboring Iran, despite insistence by his aides that he is in hiding in Iraq.
6055	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al- Obaidi said al-Sadr was in hiding "for security reasons" and that "it is not necessary to know where he is."
6056	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Also Wednesday, the U.S. military said an American soldier died the day before in a non-combat related incident.

6069	APW_ENG_20070426.1787.LDC2009T13	Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the "excellent quarter" was because of better-than-expected sales of Vista and Office.
6070	APW_ENG_20070426.1787.LDC2009T13	Liddell said Vista beat internal forecasts by $300 million (euro220.65 million) to $400 million (euro294.2 million), and Office 2007 sales were $200 million (euro147.1 million) better than expected.

6088	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	If owning a chunk of the Berlin Wall is not enough for die-hard fans of communist-era collectables, bids are now being taken for three grandiose murals from the former East German parliament.
6089	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Up for grabs are a brown-and-blue mosaic of two lovers from a wall of the former espresso bar inside the parliament, a flowery blue-and-white mosaic that decorated the ice cream parlor, and a gold-plated, tile-mural that used to adorn the palace's restaurant.
6090	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	The mosaics are both 33.5 square meters (361 square feet), while the tiled mural measures 17.5 square meters (188 square feet).

6102	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	To restore the area, the government, the city and private fundraisers plan to rebuild a version of a Prussian royal palace, which used to stand on the site, with space for museums and a luxury hotel.
6103	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Damaged during World War II, that Prussian palace was dynamited in 1950 by the East German government in a move that some in the West viewed as more ideological than practical.

6109	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The Black Family Channel will shut down and has sold its space on cable systems to the Gospel Music Channel, the networks said Tuesday.
6110	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The deal makes the Gospel Music Channel available in America's 10 largest markets, and it expects to finish the year with more than 20 million subscribers, the network said.
6111	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	"Gospel Music Channel embodies BFC's values, but does so on a broader, multicultural scale," said Willie Gary, founder of the Black Family Channel, about the shutdown.
6112	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The Gospel Music Channel is a 24-hour service that encompasses all Christian music, from rock to gospel.

6114	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	HAVANA 2007-05-10 22:27:48 UTC
6115	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The plastic explosives were smuggled in bottles of White Rain and Prell shampoo, and in the soles of a pair of black leather boots.
6116	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Fixed to Casio digital clocks and 9-volt batteries with black adhesive tape, they became powerful bombs.
6117	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Some of them never detonated, and are now on public display in Havana as part of what Cuba calls a wealth of evidence against Fidel Castro's archenemy, Luis Posada Carriles, in a string of 1997 bombings targeting Havana hotels.
6118	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	While Cuba cannot try Posada, who walks free in the United States after being cleared of immigration fraud charges this week by a Texas judge, a federal court in New Jersey just might.
6119	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	A secret grand jury is meeting in Newark to decide whether to indict Posada on charges of financing a terrorist operation.
6120	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	FBI agents visited Havana last year in connection with the probe, following up on a 1998 trip to the island, according to two U.S. law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.
6121	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"We've provided American authorities with a lot of information," Cuban Lt. Col. Roberto Hernandez Cabellero said.
6122	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Visiting FBI agents deposed him during the 1998 trip, and while he said he had no information on more recent visits, he said U.S. prosecutors should have what they need.
6123	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The American government has the information necessary to charge Posada," he said.
6124	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Posada, 79, has never been tried for the string of 1997 hotel bombings, which killed an Italian tourist, and he has never been convicted of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people.
6125	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was acquitted in the plane bombing in Venezuela, then escaped from prison while awaiting a retrial.
6126	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was detained in March 2005 on charges of lying to U.S. immigration officials, and was awaiting trial in Texas until a U.S. district judge dropped the charges Tuesday, accusing the U.S. government of "fraud, deceit and trickery" while trying to buy time for its criminal investigation.
6127	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The ruling thrilled anti-Castro Cubans in Florida, and turned frustration among Cubans on the island into rage over the Americans' failure to indict Posada for terrorism.
6128	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Cuba has called the U.S. government hypocritical for arresting alleged terrorists around the world -- and sending some to a naval base in eastern Cuba -- while letting Posada go free.
6129	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The prosecution never charged him for being what he is -- a terrorist," the Communist Party newspaper Granma declared.
6130	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But lawyers say there's a good chance that Posada will wind up being tried in New Jersey.
6131	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The (U.S.) government is working very hard on this.
6132	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	They are pushing forward on this," said Gilberto M. Garcia, the attorney for five New Jersey Cuban-Americans he described as potential witnesses.
6133	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. prosecutors, he said, are under tremendous pressure "to get him on something."
6134	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	By his own admission, Posada has dedicated his life to Castro's downfall.
6135	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He fled his native Cuba after the 1959 revolution and trained alongside other exiles for the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.
6136	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He went to Venezuela in 1967, became a citizen and worked in the country's intelligence services.
6137	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Escaping after serving nine years in a Venezuelan prison, he wound up in El Salvador where he took part in the Iran-Contra arms operation run by Lt. Col Oliver North before he was arrested in Panama in 2000.
6138	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was convicted of endangering public safety in connection with a plot to assassinate Castro at a summit, but was later pardoned.
6139	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Posada once acknowledged involvement in the Havana hotel bombings -- telling The New York Times that "we didn't want to hurt anybody" -- but now denies any link to those attacks or the jetliner explosion.
6140	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Although Venezuela still seeks his extradition in the plane bombing, a U.S. judge ruled he could not be sent there or to Cuba for fear he could be tortured.
6141	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The New Jersey probe has the most potential to put Posada behind bars in the United States.
6142	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"Follow the Newark grand jury," advised Phil Peters of the Lexington Institute, a pro-democracy think tank near Washington.
6143	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"Only one issue remains: whether the U.S. government will treat Posada as a terrorist rather than merely an illegal immigrant," Peters wrote in his blog.
6144	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The immigration charges were always a sideshow."
6145	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. Justice Department officials won't discuss the secret proceedings.
6146	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But in a 2005 affidavit, a Miami-based FBI agent said the Havana bombings probe turned up records detailing US$19,000 in wire transfers from New Jersey to Ramon Medina in Guatemala and El Salvador between 1996 and 1998.
6147	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Posada has said he had a Salvadoran passport in that name.
6148	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	During the 1999 Cuban trial of two Salvadorans in the bombings, prosecutors said Posada organized and financed the attacks, recruiting the bombers in Central America and paying about US$4,500 for each mission.
6149	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Both were given the death penalty, but were later spared and remain in prison.
6150	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The latest FBI visit to Cuba sought more evidence against Posada.
6151	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Cuban-American members of U.S. Congress were furious when they learned of the trip last week, complaining to the Justice Department that any evidence gathered by communist authorities would be suspect.
6152	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"By asking a state sponsor of terrorism for 'evidence' regarding terrorism, the Bush Administration Justice Department demonstrates a shockingly profound ignorance of the nature of terrorism, of its origins, and its state sponsors," U.S. Representatives Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros- Lehtinen said in a statement.
6153	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The only 'evidence' that the terrorist regime in Havana could provide ... would be fabricated evidence."

6157	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	SEOUL, South Korea 2007-05-11 15:16:03 UTC
6158	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	A Seoul court on Friday issued an arrest warrant for a business tycoon accused of taking part in a sensational revenge attack after his son was hurt in a karaoke bar fight, officials said.
6159	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Hanwha Group Chairman and CEO Kim Seung-youn is suspected of kicking, punching and using a steel pipe to attack bar workers allegedly involved in a scuffle with his 22-year-old son on March 8 at a karaoke pub.
6160	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	After questioning Kim at a hearing earlier Friday, the Seoul District Court accepted a prosecution request made on Thursday to issue an arrest warrant for him, said Hanwha spokesman Ju Cheol- beom.
6161	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Judge Lee Kwang-man said the warrant was issued on "concerns that he may try to destroy evidence," according to Yonhap news agency.
6162	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Kim, who has been waiting all day at the prosecutors' office for a court announcement, faces an immediate arrest and will be held at the Namdaemun Police Station in central Seoul.
6163	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	In a statement released through his company, Kim said he will "humbly accept the law's judgment."
6164	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	"I plan to explain everything that I know, truthfully and sincerely," the statement said.
6165	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	"I am very pained and ashamed for not having been honest for the past two months."
6166	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Earlier Friday, Kim said he regrets that he "failed to control impulsive emotion" and apologized for causing trouble.
6167	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	"I hope there will never be a silly father like me again," Kim told reporters after the court hearing.
6168	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	The dramatic details of the case, which media have likened to a gangster movie, has drawn intense public interest in South Korea, where the heads of family controlled conglomerates wield great economic, political and social clout.
6169	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	The younger Kim, a student at Yale University, reportedly suffered an injury that required 11 stitches in the scuffle on stairs outside the karaoke pub.
6170	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Victims have told police the elder Kim and his bodyguards took them to a mountainous area south of Seoul, where Kim himself allegedly assaulted them, including hitting one of them on the back with a 5-foot (1.5 meter) steel pipe.
6171	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	They have also told police Kim later sought out another man at a bar in central Seoul and had his son beat him, according to a police statement.
6172	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Kim has denied all the allegations.
6173	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Hanwha was established in 1952 as the Korea Explosives Corp.

6181	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	REUNION, Florida 2007-05-21 21:48:54 UTC
6182	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Gymnastics judges would no longer answer to officials in their own countries under the latest effort to remove politics from the sport.
6183	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	International Gymnastics Federation president Bruno Grandi said Monday he wants to establish a pool of judges who would have no ties or allegiances to their national federations.
6184	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The pool could be in place by 2010 or 2011.
6185	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"It is the last war I have against everybody," Grandi, speaking mostly through an interpreter, said in a 90-minute interview after the federation's annual meeting in Orlando.
6186	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"If the people understand that it's only in the interest of gymnastics, in two or three years we solve another big problem."
6187	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation -- or FIG -- already uses a judges pool for rhythmic gymnastics.
6188	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi led the charge to revamp the sport's traditional 10-point scale to an open-ended scoring system, which is supposed to give a truer representation of routine's value.
6189	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The system has been in use since the beginning of 2006, and will get its biggest test at the Beijing Olympics next year.
6190	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The change came after a series of judging errors at the Athens Olympics, most notably the debacle involving all-around champion Paul Hamm.
6191	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Two days after the competition, FIG announced that South Korea's Yang Tae-young wrongly had 0.1 points deducted off the start value of his second-to-last routine, the parallel bars.
6192	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Yang finished third, 0.049 points behind Hamm.
6193	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi's suggestion that Hamm share his gold medal fueled protests by the South Koreans that forced the American to defend himself all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
6194	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Hamm eventually was declared the rightful winner, and Grandi said again Monday he agreed with that decision.
6195	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"Paul Hamm is the Olympic champion without any ifs or buts," Grandi said.
6196	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	But the Hamm incident wasn't the only reason gymnastics had to change its rules, Grandi said.
6197	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	There also were problems with the men's high bar and vault competitions in Athens.
6198	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi also expressed concern that some don't fully understand the new points system, wrongly believing that more difficult routines are rewarded even if performed incorrectly.
6199	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"The big problem we're having lately is that we have to penalize very strongly execution mistakes or lack of artistry," he said.
6200	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"This is the big philosophy I want to get through.
6201	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	You should win if you have high difficulty, but only if it is executed perfectly.
6202	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	If not, the deductions should be so strong that it's worse to do the more difficult thing."
6203	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Execution penalties are already higher than under the old system -- eight-tenths of a point, compared to a half-point -- but Grandi said he'd like to see them doubled.
6204	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation has also held classes to make sure judges understand the new rules, and is using video replay so judges can review routines.
6205	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"I intend for the Olympic Games to make sure the judges will apply the rules correctly," Grandi said.

6212	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	The 27-nation EU "is particularly troubled by the recent wave of arrests of civil society and women's rights activists," Germany said in a statement on behalf of the bloc.

6224	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate word from the government.
6225	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a fierce clampdown on the opposition in March, worried that Zimbabwe's fast-deteriorating economic crisis could spark an uprising.

6261	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The American Civil Liberties Union sued a subsidiary of Boeing Co., claiming it provided secret CIA transportation services for three terrorism suspects who were tortured under the U.S. government's "extraordinary rendition" program.

6267	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The three have claimed through their family and lawyers that they have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal standards.
6268	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance.
6269	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in California, charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the men to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment."
6270	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Mike Pound, a spokesman for Jeppesen, said company officials had not yet seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
6271	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	He said Jeppesen provides support services, rather than the flights themselves, for airlines, private pilots and companies.
6272	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	"We don't know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight plan," he said.
6273	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	"We don't need to know specific details.
6274	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	It's the customer's business, and we do the business that we are contracted for.
6275	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip."
6276	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause.
6277	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	"Either (Jeppesen) knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said.
6278	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," said Wizner.
6279	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit.
6280	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets defense in similar lawsuits.
6281	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit says Jeppesen "furnished essential flight and logistical support to aircraft used by the CIA to transfer terror suspects to secret detention and interrogation facilities in countries such as Morocco and Egypt where, according to the U.S. Department of State, the use of torture is `routine,' as well as to U.S.-run detention facilities overseas, where the United States government maintains that the safeguards of U.S. law do not apply."
6282	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be tortured.
6283	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The ACLU said its lawsuit was being filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty.

6297	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno is the only Cuban female umpire to crack the National Series, the island's major professional league.
6298	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She worked her first game in December at the start of the most recent season.
6299	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"The crowd applauded, the players congratulated me," the 32-year- old umpire said recently.

6303	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	No woman has umpired an American major league regular-season game.

6305	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno umpired 90 games last season in Cuba's top league, including the playoffs, during which she worked quarterfinal and semifinal series.

6308	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno sometimes works behind the plate, sometimes on the bases.
6309	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Like their U.S. counterparts, Cuban umpires rotate positions.
6310	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She played third base and shortstop and often batted cleanup as a youngster.
6311	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno became an umpire in part because of her frustration at not being able to play in organized leagues.

6319	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno's story has inspired other women to try their hands at umpiring: Thirty plan to attend the national school when a new round of classes begins in September.

6322	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno, who hopes to become certified for international competition in Cuba after graduating from umpire school, said she still considers every game she works a learning experience.

6326	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Even when she makes a mistake, Moreno said with a smile, players' reactions are more mischievous than angry.

6333	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Under the cover of artillery barrages, dozens of Lebanese army tanks and armored carriers on Friday pushed forward against Islamic militants barricaded in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon.
6334	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The concentrated bombardment began in the morning, with heavy barrages targeting all parts of the Nahr el-Bared camp, where Fatah Islam militants have been holed up in a 13-day siege by the Lebanese army.
6335	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The artillery bombardment sent clouds of white smoke rising from the camp, and the shelling ignited fires inside it, spewing black smoke.
6336	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The militants have barricaded themselves in the camp's residential neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets and apartment buildings.
6337	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	However, reports on the ground indicated the army did not penetrate deep into the camp, but limited its advance to outer neighborhoods militants use for sniper fire against army positions.
6338	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Nahr el-Bared, like the other 11 Palestinian camps in Lebanon, has been off limits to Lebanese authorities under a nearly 40-year-old agreement that allowed Palestinians to run their own affairs.
6339	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Palestinian representative to Lebanon, Abbas Zaki, told al- Jazeera television that the military action was limited, engaging militants on the camp's outer areas.
6340	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He said there would be no storming of the camp's interior, where thousands of civilians remain.
6341	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and 10 wounded in the fighting Friday, according to security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
6342	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The officials said that a "unit" of Fatah Islam militants was "wiped out" but gave no casualty count.
6343	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The deaths Friday raised to 34 the number of soldiers killed since fighting between the army and Fatah Islam militants began on May 20.
6344	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants also have been killed before Friday's fighting.
6345	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	About 50 armored carriers, battle tanks and military vehicles from elite units massed at the northern edge of the camp and drove toward the forward positions, according to an AP Television News crew at the scene.
6346	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling, accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the troops were in close combat with the militants.
6347	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	But the bombardment again intensified several hours later.
6348	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's northern edge.
6349	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	They said operation sought to silence the militant fire to protect army positions.
6350	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	A resident from inside the camp said some Fatah Islam positions were overtaken and destroyed in the push.
6351	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of militant reprisals.
6352	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"What we have decided is to deal with Fatah Islam as a group, a terrorist group taking hostages who are left in the camp," said Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh.
6353	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He told AP Television News in Beirut that the army may be seeking to isolate the militants.
6354	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"I think the army is determined this time to go ahead and probably to reduce several pockets of Fatah Islam terrorist," he said.
6355	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Cabinet Minister Ahmed Fatfat told Al-Arabiya television that the army came under sniper fire earlier Friday and decided to respond.
6356	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"It seems they have destroyed those positions."
6357	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Zaki, the Palestinian representative to Lebanon, expressed hope that the siege would be tightened.

6370	APW_ENG_20070608.0911.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-06-08 13:27:27 UTC
6371	APW_ENG_20070608.0911.LDC2009T13	(AP) -- Suzuki Motor Corp. said Friday it will build a car assembly plant near St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city.
6372	APW_ENG_20070608.0911.LDC2009T13	The automaker will invest 14 billion yen (US$115.7 million
6373	APW_ENG_20070608.0911.LDC2009T13	euro86.67 million) for the plant that is expected to start operations in late 2009 with about 500 employees, the company said in a statement.
6374	APW_ENG_20070608.0911.LDC2009T13	The plant will be used for assembling Grand Vitara and SX4 passenger cars, it said.

6378	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-06-08 16:13:46 UTC
6379	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered that Paris Hilton be brought to court Friday for a hearing on her early release from jail rather than listen to the proceeding by telephone.
6380	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer was the latest in a flurry of developments surrounding Hilton's early release from prison.
6381	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That move sparked protests by many -- including local and state authorities and civil rights leaders -- who argued it could interpreted as affording the socialite favors not available to other, less famous, inmates.
6382	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Sauer's decision was announced by court spokesman Allan Parachini shortly before the start of a hearing that could put her behind bars again for violating probation in a reckless driving case.
6383	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Judge Sauer has instructed the Sheriff's Department to go to Ms. Hilton's residence, pick her up and bring her here.
6384	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That is happening now," Parachini told reporters outside the courthouse.
6385	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton on Thursday was originally ordered to report to court at 9 a.m. (1600 GMT) and the judge signed an order for deputies to bring her in a sheriff's vehicle from her home, said Allan Parachini.
6386	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	But early Friday, Parachini had announced that she would be allowed to take part in the hearing by telephone.
6387	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
6388	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk at news cameras.
6389	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	One of them was Moses Baltazar who was attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket.
6390	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he was no fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from her.
6391	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.
6392	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Driving like that, you have to behave.
6393	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	If you're rich, you have money, you have to respect yourself," he said, adding he thinks she should be returned to jail.
6394	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence.
6395	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She had spent three days, and was credited for five.
6396	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton was fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and was expected to finish the sentence for a reckless driving probation violation at her four-bedroom, three-bath home.
6397	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
6398	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention.
6399	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Late Thursday, Sauer issued the order for Hilton to return to court after the city attorney filed a petition demanding that Hilton be returned to jail and to show cause why Baca should not be held in contempt of court.
6400	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca does not have to be in court, and it was unclear who would represent the Sheriff's Department.
6401	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The move also was met with outrage from the sheriff's deputies union, members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, civil rights leaders, defense attorneys and others.
6402	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"What transpired here is outrageous," county Supervisor Don Knabe told The Associated Press, adding he received more than 400 angry e-mails and hundreds more phone calls from around the country.
6403	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's return home "gives the impression of ... celebrity justice being handed out," he said.
6404	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca dismissed the criticism, saying the decision was made based on medical advice.
6405	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It isn't wise to keep a person in jail with her problem over an extended period of time and let the problem get worse," Baca told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
6406	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca said.
6407	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	California Attorney General Jerry Brown criticized the Sheriff's Department for letting Hilton out of jail, saying he believed she should serve out her sentence.
6408	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It does hold up the system to ridicule when the powerful and the famous get special treatment," Brown told The Associated Press in an interview before testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.
6409	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure there's a lot of people who've seen their family members go to jail and have various ailments, physical and psychological, that didn't get them released," he said.
6410	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'd say it's time for a course correction."
6411	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The Los Angeles County jail system is so overcrowded that attorneys and jail officials have said it is not unusual for nonviolent offenders like Hilton to be released after serving as little as 10 percent of their sentences.
6412	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip.
6413	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	As word spread that the 26-year-old poster child for bad celebrity behavior was back home, radio helicopter pilots who normally report on traffic conditions were dispatched to hover over her house and describe it to morning commuters.
6414	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Paparazzi photographers on the ground quickly assembled outside its gates.
6415	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her attorney.
6416	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I want to thank the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and staff of the Century Regional Detention Center for treating me fairly and professionally," she said.
6417	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I am going to serve the remaining 40 days of my sentence.
6418	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	I have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes."
6419	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's path to jail began Sept. 7, when she failed a sobriety test after police saw her weaving down a street in her Mercedes- Benz on what she said was a late-night run to a hamburger stand.
6420	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 (euro1,124) in fines.
6421	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the months that followed she was stopped twice by officers who discovered her driving on a suspended license.
6422	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The second stop landed her in Sauer's courtroom, where he sentenced her to jail.

6427	APW_ENG_20070610.0509.LDC2009T13	Police have arrested two men for the murder in April of two elderly nuns in a convent in southern Greece, authorities said Sunday.
6428	APW_ENG_20070610.0509.LDC2009T13	The men -- a Greek and a Macedonian national -- confessed to the killing after their arrest late Friday, police said.
6429	APW_ENG_20070610.0509.LDC2009T13	The nuns were strangled during an overnight robbery at the Artokostas Convent, on a rocky hillside near the town of Astros, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Athens.

6435	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Vietnam's first bird flu patient in 18 months has fully recovered, but more outbreaks among poultry are likely nationwide, officials and state-controlled media reported Tuesday.

6437	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	A second bird flu victim who was hospitalized in late May is still being treated at the Hospital of Tropical Diseases.
6438	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat warned that more outbreaks could occur among poultry.
6439	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Sixteen provinces have been hit since early May, killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 100,000 birds, Tuesday's Saigon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon) newspaper reported.
6440	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Phat blamed the latest outbreaks on virus-carrying waterfowl and the local authorities' failure to fight it aggressively, it said.

6443	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car ushers in a new era with the standing start
6444	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	PORTLAND, Oregon 2007-06-13 21:06:33 UTC
6445	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Justin Wilson admits he's going to have to pay a bit more attention now that Champ Car has adopted the standing start.
6446	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I saw the lights go out and I thought, 'I'm meant to do something now,'" he joked after the inaugural race to use the start.
6447	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I have to work on my reactions."
6448	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car traditionally has used rolling starts, the generally accepted practice in American racing where the cars already are moving and gaining speed when the green flag is thrown.
6449	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts -- the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead stop on a grid.
6450	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	When the last of a bank of lights above the track goes out, the drivers take off.
6451	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Once all the red lights go out, you drop your clutch and go, and that's the start," said Wilson, who had the pole for the race.
6452	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's quite a buildup in tension because you have a few moments where it's very quiet and nothing's happening and then all of the sudden everyone's on full throttle and they drop their clutch."
6453	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car had wanted to use standing starts at the beginning of the season, but it was delayed for further testing until the Grand Prix of Portland, the fourth race of the season.
6454	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The move toward standing starts got a mixed reaction from drivers.
6455	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Points leader and three-time defending series champion Sebastien Bourdais was especially vocal with concerns that drivers could stall at the start, setting up rear-end accidents all over the grid.
6456	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total disaster," he said.
6457	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Many drivers already had experience with the procedure.
6458	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The Champ Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for the most part.
6459	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because there's so much more power," Rahal said.
6460	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to put the power down on these cars as it is.
6461	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	In third gear coming out of a corner it can be hard to do.
6462	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	So doing it from a stop is a tough thing, especially when it is wet."
6463	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Fellow rookie Robert Doornbos brought in perspective from two seasons with Formula One.
6464	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains Doornbos.
6465	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Here it is all driver.
6466	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	If you mess up, you stall and have a big problem.
6467	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I did three or four and it went quite well.
6468	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
6469	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to the rolling start.
6470	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled, which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland.
6471	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean it's never going to happen.
6472	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It means I was a little more pessimistic than the truth.
6473	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Definitely put on a good show."
6474	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Cleveland will be the next chance for fans to see the standing start, which Champ Car is expected to use the remainder of the season.
6475	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But many drivers say they'd like the series to keep rolling starts in the mix, too.
6476	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm not sure which I prefer.
6477	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I like doing them both," Wilson said.
6478	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season.
6479	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I think that's the best way.
6480	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	To master both skills is the best thing for the drivers."

6493	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Most analysts say refineries should be using 94 percent to 95 percent of their capacity at this time of year.
6494	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Crude oil inventories rose by 100,000 barrels last week, when analysts had expected a 400,000-barrel decline.

6496	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	U.S. refiners reported an unusually high number of outages this spring, crimping gasoline supplies.
6497	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Reports of outages continued on Wednesday, with Valero Energy Corp. saying it was shutting down a machine at its Ardmore, Okla., refinery for maintenance.
6498	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	"The gasoline supply in the U.S. looks to be a key factor driving the crude oil market.
6499	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	It's like the tail wagging the dog," Shum said.
6500	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Geopolitical factors also continue to provide a floor for oil prices, he said.
6501	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Tensions over Iran's atomic programme escalated following Tehran's recent reduction of cooperation with the U.N. atomic monitoring agency.

6512	APW_ENG_20070614.1652.LDC2009T13	Badr said the men would stay at a camp in Rafah used by the Egyptian central security forces.

6542	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	GENEVA 2007-06-20 10:20:09 UTC
6543	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The United States should face commercial sanctions worth more than US$3.4 billion (euro2.5 billion) each year for its failure to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that its Internet gambling restrictions are illegal, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda said Wednesday.
6544	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Antigua, which won a WTO ruling last year against the U.S. restrictions, is asking the trade body for authorization to target American trademarks and copyrights if the U.S. refuses to change its legislation.
6545	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	It said the sanctions would come into effect "shortly," unless the United States requests a WTO arbitration panel on the level and scope of the sanctions.
6546	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	"While we realize this is a significant step for Antigua and Barbuda to take, we feel we have no other choice in the matter," Antigua's Finance Minister L. Errol Cort said in a statement.
6547	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	"Until such time as the United States is willing to work with us on achieving a reasonable solution to this trade dispute, we will continue to use every legitimate remedy available to protect the interests of our citizens," he said.
6548	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The move by Antigua comes a day after the European Union told the United States it too wanted compensation for the U.S. ban on foreign online gambling sites.
6549	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	U.S. trade officials were not immediately available for comment.
6550	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Antigua argues that before the ban was introduced, online gambling provided income for hundreds of its citizens and helped end its reliance on tourism, which was hurt by a series of hurricanes in the late 1990s.
6551	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Last year Washington stopped U.S. banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling businesses outside the country.
6552	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The decision closed off the most lucrative region in a market worth US$15.5 billion (euro11.6 billion) last year.

6556	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	BEIRUT, Lebanon 2007-06-23 00:11:45 UTC
6557	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The head of the Arab League pressed Lebanon's feuding leaders to resume dialogue to resolve the country's deepening political crisis after failing to mediate such an agreement himself.
6558	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Wrapping up four days of talks with rival Lebanese factions, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the agenda for the proposed dialogue should include three main topics: the formation of a national unity government
6559	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	the election of a new president to succeed President Emile Lahoud, whose term expires in November
6560	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	and the preservation of Lebanon's security and stability in the face of a spate of bombings and assassinations.
6561	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa said at a press conference Friday that "remaining obstacles" prevented an agreement to restart talks based on the proposed agenda during his visit, but did not provide further details.
6562	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	A Cabinet member said Moussa's mission ended in "total failure" after the Hezbollah-led opposition rejected his proposal.
6563	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"The opposition, at Syria's instructions, scuttled the Arab League mission to resume national dialogue," Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh told The Associated Press late Friday.
6564	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Hamadeh, a leading anti-Syrian politician, said that while all pro-government groups had agreed to Moussa's three-point proposal to resume dialogue, the opposition rejected it.
6565	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Members of the Syria-backed opposition could not immediately be reached for comment.
6566	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Lebanon is facing its most serious political crisis since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, with the Western-backed government and the Hezbollah-led opposition locked in a fierce power struggle.
6567	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Rival Lebanese politicians have not met since a national dialogue conference ended last year without agreement.
6568	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The crisis has taken on an increasingly sectarian tone and has erupted into street clashes between supporters of pro- and anti- government factions in recent months, killing 11 people.
6569	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	One of the opposition's key demands is the creation of a new national unity government in which it has veto power.
6570	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The existing government has so far resisted such a move.
6571	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	A political crisis is looming over the presidency as well.
6572	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The legislature must vote on a replacement for pro-Syrian Lahoud, but it is highly unlikely that Lebanon's divided leaders can agree on a candidate -- threatening a power vacuum, or even worse the creation of two rival governments.
6573	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Lebanon has also been shaken by a string of bombings and assassinations in the past two years targeting mainly anti-Syrian politicians and journalists.
6574	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The latest victim was anti-Syrian lawmaker Walid Eido, who was killed along with his son, two bodyguards and six passers-by last week in a car bombing in Beirut.
6575	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The Lebanese army has also been battling al-Qaida-inspired militants barricaded in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon for over a month.
6576	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"There is a chance for all (parties) to sit together and reach an understanding on the country's problems," Moussa said.
6577	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"Dialogue is a right, a duty and is in the interest of all the Lebanese," he said.
6578	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"The absence of dialogue harms Lebanon's interest."
6579	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Without setting a date for the proposed dialogue, Moussa said such meetings should be held within "a definite time."
6580	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the proposed agenda for the dialogue provided "elements" for a solution to the political crisis.
6581	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the Arab League would continue its efforts, including contacts with regional and international powers, to help the Lebanese reach a solution to the crisis.
6582	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa, leading an Arab League delegation, arrived here Tuesday in an attempt to help rival politicians end the monthslong political crisis.
6583	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Parliament is not functioning and the government just barely, after a quarter of Cabinet members resigned.
6584	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Opposition supporters have been holding a sit-in outside Prime Minister Fuad Saniora's office since Dec. 1, calling for his resignation and the formation of a new government.
6585	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Saniora, backed by the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, the United States and the West, has refused to step down.
6586	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa said he would soon hold talks with Syria, which strongly supports the opposition's demand for a new government.
6587	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The Arab League delegation was dispatched to Beirut after a foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week in the wake of Eido's assassination, which his supporters blamed on Syria.

6593	APW_ENG_20070624.0434.LDC2009T13	The battle came as the Indian army foiled another bid by militants from neighboring Pakistan to sneak into Indian- controlled Kashmir on Sunday, in a gunfight that left three rebels dead, officials said.

6595	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-06-29 00:35:02 UTC
6596	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new "Transformers" movie boasts a good cast, but it's got nothing on the original.
6597	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In a classic bit of movie trivia, the little-seen 1986 animated film "Transformers: The Movie" was Orson Welles' last film.
6598	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Yes, that Orson Welles.
6599	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The filmmaking legend who remade cinema with "Citizen Kane" (which just again topped AFI's list of 100 greatest movies), directed "Touch of Evil," starred in "The Third Man," impeccably adapted Shakespeare to the screen and panicked the nation with his infamous radio broadcast of "War of the Worlds" -- concluded his career by playing Unicron, an evil shape-shifting planet moon.
6600	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was 70 at the time and in poor health.
6601	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His last released film was 1987's "Someone to Love," but that was shot before Welles lent his voice to "Transformers."
6602	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Late in his career, Welles often took to commercials and narration work as a source of income.
6603	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Author Barbara Leaming spent many days with Welles in his last three years for her book, "Orson Welles: A Biography."
6604	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	She recalls Welles telling her shortly before he died that he had spent the day "playing a toy."
6605	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"That was for him a way of earning a living and a way of trying to finance the films that he wanted to make," says Leaming.
6606	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Obviously in those years, there's a tremendous sadness except that the thing he used to always say to me was, `The one thing that's helped me to survive is that I'm not bitter.'"
6607	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Having built his reputation in theater and radio, Welles' immediate, astounding success as a 25-year-old filmmaker with "Citizen Kane" (1941) is Hollywood legend.
6608	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Though he went on to create a number of masterpieces (among them "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Othello"), he is often viewed as failing to recapture his early brilliance.
6609	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In his later decades, Welles had great difficulty gaining financing for his film projects.
6610	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Leaming says he used to refer to parts like "Transformers" as "a job of work," but says he was nevertheless full of ideas and spoke passionately of plans for various movies even on his deathbed.
6611	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He died of a heart attack in October 1985.
6612	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He was absolutely the same man who made `Citizen Kane,'" says Leaming of the aged Welles.
6613	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His voice work in "Transformers: The Movie" was so weak that it was altered with synthesizers until it hardly sounded like him.
6614	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Flint Dille, story consultant on the film, remembers Welles' warm, magnanimous personality.

6617	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The part is in some ways typical of the characters to which Welles was drawn.
6618	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Film critic and historian David Thomson, who wrote "Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles," once described Welles as being attracted to "distorted portraits of grandeur."
6619	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was not the only famous talent to lend his voice to "Transformers: The Movie."
6620	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He was joined by Eric Idle ("Monty Python"), Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek"), Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club") and Robert Stack ("Unsolved Mysteries").
6621	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In this way, "Transformers: The Movie" presaged a contemporary commonplace: cartoons voiced by stars.
6622	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Today, an animated film wouldn't dream of not casting well-known performers.
6623	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"It was groundbreaking to introduce these famous actors in an animated feature," "Transformers: The Movie" producer Joe Bacal says on the DVD.
6624	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Back in 1986, though, it wasn't the payday it is now.
6625	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Transformers: The Movie" yielded less than $6 million at the box office.
6626	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new live-action "Transformers," which opens in theaters July 3, hopes to reap that in a matter of hours.
6627	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The path of "Transformers" reflects the changed nature of Hollywood.
6628	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	What began as a toy for children in the early '80s, has now become an enormous, global Goliath of pop-culture product, meant as much for adults as kids.
6629	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	It's a destiny for "Transformers" that few could have imagined in 1986, even Welles himself.
6630	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Indeed, "Transformers: The Movie" is set in the distant future: the year 2005.

6642	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-06-30 05:58:38 UTC
6643	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The co-founder of Neteller, a company based in Britain that processed billions of dollars in Internet gambling transactions for Americans, has pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal conspiracy.
6644	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Lawrence, whose company, Neteller PLC, was once one of the primary ways U.S. citizens placed bets with offshore bookies, acknowledged in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that the operation was illegal.
6645	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"I came to understand that providing payment services to online gambling Web sites serving customers in the United States was wrong," he told the judge Friday.
6646	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	His lawyers said he was cooperating with U.S. investigators and also had agreed to be at least partly responsible for the $100 million (euro74.05 million) the government is seeking in restitution.
6647	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and another Neteller director, John David Lefebvre, were arrested in January as part of a U.S. crackdown on the online gambling industry.
6648	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Both men are Canadian citizens.
6649	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Their company was based in the Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
6650	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Some experts initially believed that Neteller's offshore status put it beyond the reach of U.S. law.
6651	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The company also was not directly involved in either placing or receiving bets.
6652	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It essentially served as a financial middleman, through which bettors could send and receive cash from Web-based operations located in countries with few restrictions on gambling.
6653	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors read U.S. law differently, and charged Lawrence with violating decades-old acts prohibiting the use of electronic wires to send or receive information that facilitates illegal gambling.
6654	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, who remains free on $5 million (euro3.7 million) bail, declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
6655	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"Mr. Lawrence is very glad to have this episode over and is looking forward to moving on to the next stage in his life," said his attorney, Peter Neiman.
6656	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He said Lawrence intended to return to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been scheduled for October.
6657	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear whether Lawrence will face prison time.
6658	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the case.
6659	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The case against Lefebvre, who pleaded not guilty, is pending.
6660	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Neteller stopped processing gambling transactions for U.S. customers within days of Lawrence's arrest in January, ending a brief period in which it had soared to the top of the cottage industry that helps Americans wager billions of dollars a year online.
6661	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1999, the company grew fast as spooked credit card companies, worried about legal liability, stopped doing business with offshore gambling operations.
6662	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said Neteller processed $5.1 billion worth of transactions in the first half of 2006.
6663	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Nearly all involved online gambling.
6664	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	A majority of the company's revenue came from customers in the U.S., and the FBI began looking at its operations in June 2006.
6665	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, at one point, was the company's largest shareholder.
6666	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Both he and Lefebvre have since left the company's board of directors.
6667	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and Lefebvre are among a group of businessmen linked to online gambling who have faced U.S. charges.
6668	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Kaplan, the founder of the London-based bookmaker BetOnSports PLC, was indicted on racketeering charges in St. Louis.

6670	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The chairman of Sportingbet PLC was detained briefly last year in New York after he was indicted on online gambling charges in Louisiana.
6671	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Congress last year also enacted new regulations further barring banks and credit card companies from processing online gambling payments.
6672	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The crackdown has not sat well abroad.
6673	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The World Trade Organization ruled in December that the law is unfair to offshore casinos.

6677	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 2007-07-01 12:14:16 UTC
6678	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Four men, including three members of Saudi Arabia's religious police, went on trial Sunday for their alleged involvement in the death of a man in detention -- an unprecedented case against a powerful force long resented for intimidating people.
6679	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The religious police enforce the kingdom's strict Islamic lifestyle, patrolling public places to ensure women are covered, the sexes don't mingle, shops close five times a day for Muslim prayers and men go to the mosque and worship.
6680	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The man's family is demanding the death penalty for those found guilty of the death their relative, Ahmed al-Bulaiwi, a retired border patrol guard in his early 50s.
6681	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Al-Bulaiwi died in custody shortly after his June 1 arrest for being alone with a woman who was not a relative -- an act considered an offense in the kingdom.
6682	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Audah al-Bulaiwi, who is representing the family in court, said three judges presided over the first hearing in the case in the northern city of Tabuk.
6683	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	He said the defendants -- three members of the religious police and a fourth believed to be from the regular police -- were present in the courtroom.
6684	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	"We are demanding execution for those found guilty," he said.
6685	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam under which those convicted of murder, drug trafficking, rape and armed robbery are executed in public with a sword.
6686	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	A new hearing has been set for Tuesday, said Audah al-Bulaiwi.
6687	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The trial was supposed to begin on June 23, but a judge postponed it to Sunday because the documents the al-Bulaiwi family had presented were incomplete.
6688	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Al-Bulaiwi's death -- and the case of a second man who died in custody -- are a setback for the Commission for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which employs the religious police.
6689	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The cases have provoked a wave of condemnation and calls for the regulation of this independent body.
6690	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	In the al-Bulaiwi case, commission members arrested the man after they observed the woman, believed to be in her 50s, getting into his car near an amusement park, according to accounts published by the local media.
6691	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Under the kingdom's rules, a woman cannot drive, and can only go out in public with her father, brother, son or husband.
6692	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	An investigation showed that al-Bulaiwi, who supplemented his pension by working as a driver, was asked by the family of the woman to drive her home, according to press reports.
6693	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	An official medical report cleared the commission members, saying al-Bulaiwi died of natural causes.
6694	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The defendants are being tried under the private rights of crime victims or their dependents.
6695	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Another commission member has been arrested in the case of Sulaiman al-Huraisi, who died last month while in custody of the religious police.

6698	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	In a third case, a Saudi woman has filed a lawsuit against the commission, claiming she was mistreated by two commission members in 2003 because she was not dressed conservatively.
6699	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	A hearing is set for Monday.
6700	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Many Saudis say they support the idea of having the commission because its mandate is based on several verses in the Quran.
6701	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	But they also say it should be regulated because the free rein it has long enjoyed has led to some of its members overstepping their duties.

6703	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-07-04 13:51:18 UTC
6704	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers say a museum in central Japan has right whale fossils that are at least 5 million years old, making them the oldest fossilized remains of the animal in the world, officials said Wednesday.
6705	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers working in Nagano prefecture (state) estimate the fossilized skull bones and jaw of a right whale on display at the Shinshushinmachi Fossil Museum to be 5 million to 6 million years old, said museum curator Ken Narita.
6706	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The oldest right whale fossil previously found was a skeleton that was uncovered in Italy that dates back about 4 million years, Narita said.
6707	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	"This was an amazing find, and to have found the oldest one of this type makes it truly remarkable," he said.
6708	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground.
6709	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	However, the skeleton was left undisturbed because the country was then at war, according to the museum's Web site.
6710	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers finally returned to the site in 1967, but the exposed parts of the skeleton had been scattered or lost.
6711	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Only the skull and upper jaw parts were left to be excavated, but it was not until recently that the museum could afford to get the bones dated, Narita said.
6712	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	While of the right whale genus, the animal's species is believed to have been different from those of other right whale fossils found so far, he added.
6713	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Right whale skeletons have often been found in Europe, but the Nagano fossils and their dating "raises the possibility that right whales might have originated in the North Pacific," said Toshiyuki Kimura, curator of the Gunma Museum of Natural History.
6714	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Kimura also took part in the fossil research.
6715	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Right whales are now designated an endangered species and banned for hunting by the International Whaling Commission.
6716	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The entire North Atlantic right whale population is estimated at just 350, according to a U.S. federal researcher.

6794	APW_ENG_20070712.1547.LDC2009T13	CARACAS, Venezuela 2007-07-12 22:42:54 UTC
6795	APW_ENG_20070712.1547.LDC2009T13	Mexico captain Rafael Marquez left the team on Thursday, two days before its playoff for third against Uruguay in the Copa America.
6796	APW_ENG_20070712.1547.LDC2009T13	Marquez said he needed to rest after a demanding Spanish league season with FC Barcelona followed by a tough Copa America, in which Mexico's title hopes were crushed on Wednesday 3-0 by tournament favorite Argentina in the semifinals.
6797	APW_ENG_20070712.1547.LDC2009T13	"I've talked to the coach and Justino Compean (president of Mexico's soccer federation) and have decided to leave the team now due to physical concerns, basically tiredness," Marquez said.
6798	APW_ENG_20070712.1547.LDC2009T13	Coach Hugo Sanchez said "there are players who are fresh and ready to take Marquez's place" on the field on Saturday in Caracas.

6806	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-07-13 20:18:30 UTC
6807	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Two prominent Senate Republicans have drafted legislation that would require President George W., Bush to come up with a plan by mid-October to dramatically narrow the mission of U.S. troops in Iraq.
6808	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The legislation, which represents a sharp challenge to Bush from senior members of his own party, was put forward Friday by Sens. John Warner and Richard Lugar, and it came as the Pentagon acknowledged that a decreasing number of Iraqi army battalions are able to operate independently of U.S. troops.
6809	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's factions, the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, pluralist, democratic government that is able to police itself, protect its borders, and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in the near future," the Warner-Lugar proposal said.
6810	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Bush has asked Congress to hold off on demanding a change in the course of the war until September, when the top U.S. commander, Gen. David Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, delivers a fresh assessment of its progress.
6811	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner and Lugar are well regarded within Congress on defense issues.
6812	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner was the longtime chairman of the Armed Services Committee before stepping down last year, while Lugar is the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
6813	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal states that "American military and diplomatic strategy in Iraq must adjust to the reality that sectarian factionalism is not likely to abate anytime soon and probably cannot be controlled from the top."
6814	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Accordingly, Warner and Lugar say Bush must draft a plan for U.S. troops that would keep them from "policing the civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq" and focus them instead on protecting Iraq's borders, targeting terrorists and defending U.S. assets.
6815	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	At the Pentagon, meanwhile, Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the number of battle-ready Iraqi battalions able to fight on their own has dropped to a half-dozen from 10 in recent months despite heightened American training efforts.
6816	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Without providing numbers, the White House had acknowledged in its report to Congress Thursday that not enough progress was being made in training Iraqi security forces -- an issue that determines to a large extent when the United States may be able to reduce its forces there.
6817	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Pace, however, also said the readiness of the Iraqi fighting units was not an issue to be "overly concerned" about because the problem is partly attributable to the fact that the Iraq units are out operating in the field.
6818	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Appearing at a news conference with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Pace said that "as units operate in the field, they have casualties, they consume vehicles and equipment."
6819	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal is the first major legislative challenge to Bush's Iraq policy endorsed by the two senators -- and lent a more bipartisan imprint to congressional dissatisfaction with the war now in its fifth year.
6820	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, both Lugar and Warner expressed grave doubts about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq.
6821	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	But both have been reluctant to back binding legislation that would force the president's hand.
6822	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The legislation would direct Bush to present the new strategy to Congress by Oct. 16 and suggests it be ready for implementation by Dec. 31.
6823	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The proposal also would seek to make Bush renew the authorization for war that Congress gave him in 2002.
6824	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Many members contend that authorization -- which led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- was limited to approval of deposing dictator Saddam Hussein and searching for weapons of mass destruction.
6825	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The fast-moving developments capped another stressful week for Bush and administration figures who have been resisting attempts by majority Democrats in Congress to force a U.S. troop withdrawal.
6826	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The administration sent to the Hill an interim progress report Thursday which said that only about half of some 18 congressionally mandated benchmarks for improvements in the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have been accomplished.
6827	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier Friday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exhorted congressional critics to give the administration and the fledgling government until September to "make a coherent judgment of where we are."
6828	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The day after the House of Representatives voted 223-201 for a Democratic proposal to force a U.S. troop withdrawal by next spring, she acknowledged that al-Maliki's government has not achieved "as much progress as we would like.
6829	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	But we shouldn't just dismiss as inconsequential the progress that they have made."
6830	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	And Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon, a top U.S. commander in Iraq, told Pentagon reporters in a separate news conference via video linkup from Iraq that "there will be consequences" if U.S. troops withdraw too soon.
6831	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Mixon spoke of a troop drawdown that would be smaller and slower than Democrats envision.
6832	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It needs to be well thought out," he said of any plans to drawn down forces.
6833	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It cannot be a strategy that is based on 'Well, we need to leave.'
6834	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	That's not a strategy, that's a withdrawal."

6843	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	"I was so scared -- the violent shaking went on for 20 seconds," Ritei Wakatsuki, an employee of convenience store Lawson, told The Associated Press by telephone from Kashiwazaki.
6844	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	"I almost fainted by the fear of shaking."
6845	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Flames and billows of black smoke poured from the Kashiwazaki nuclear plant, which automatically shut down during the quake.
6846	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The fire, at an electrical transformer, was put out shortly after noon and there was no release of radioactivity or damage to the reactors, said Motoyasu Tamaki, a Tokyo Electric Power Co.
6847	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Some 440 people were evacuated from the quake zone, NHK reported.
6848	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The force of the quake buckled seaside roads and bridges, and one-meter (yard) wide fissures could been seen in the ground along the coastline.
6849	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	One of two people buried under a collapsed apartment house had been rescued, though the person's condition was unknown, police said.
6850	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Separately, TV footage showed rescue workers and firefighters hacking at the roof of a damaged home searching for anyone trapped within.

6853	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	No one was injured.
6854	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings along the coast of Niigata prefecture (state), but the warnings were later lifted.
6855	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Waves as high as 50 centimeters (20 inches) were believed to have hit the coast, but no damage was reported.
6856	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The quake, which hit the region at 10:13 a.m. (0113GMT) was centered off the coast of Niigata, 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of the capital, Tokyo.
6857	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The tremor made buildings in Tokyo sway and was also felt in northern and central Japan.
6858	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The agency initially measured the quake at a 6.6 magnitude, but later revised that up to 6.8.

6866	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Niigata Airport, which had suspended flights shortly after the quake, resumed services after finding no damage, Kyodo said.
6867	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Japan sits atop four tectonic plates and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.
6868	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The last major quake to hit the capital, Tokyo, killed some 142,000 people in 1923, and experts say the capital has a 90 percent chance of suffering a major quake in the next 50 years.
6869	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	In October 2004, a magnitude-6.8 earthquake hit Niigata, killing 40 people and damaging more than 6,000 homes.
6870	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	It was the deadliest to hit Japan since 1995, when a magnitude-7.2 quake killed 6,433 people in the western city of Kobe.

6873	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN and Michael Moore trade angry accusations over `Sicko ' accuracy
6874	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-07-16 21:25:15 UTC
6875	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"Sicko" filmmaker Michael Moore called a truce Monday in his weeklong fight with CNN that flared when the network accused him of misstating facts in his popular documentary about the health- care system.
6876	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore had promised the network over the weekend that "I'm about to become your worst nightmare," leading CNN to post on its Web site a remarkably lengthy response to his accusations.
6877	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore noted in an interview Monday that CNN had admitted to two mistakes in its reporting on "Sicko" and that he is willing to move on.
6878	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I trust the intelligence of the American people," Moore told The Associated Press.
6879	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's a whole lot more to do with this other than I and others are going to be a lot more skeptical with what I see on CNN."
6880	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN, in its statement, noted that it has given Moore multiple opportunities to discuss his concerns about the report on the air.
6881	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic that someone who has made a career out of holding powerful interests accountable is so sensitive to having his own work held up to the light by impartial journalists, as we did in our examination of `Sicko,'" CNN said.
6882	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Shortly before Moore appeared for an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, the network ran a report by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that had done some fact-checking on Moore's movie.
6883	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Gupta's report made Moore furious, leading to a contentious segment with Blitzer and a debate with Gupta on "Larry King Live" later in the week.
6884	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Gupta addressed several statistics in "Sicko" before concluding: "No matter how much Moore fudged the facts -- and he did fudge some facts -- there is one thing everyone can agree on: the (health care) system here should be far better."
6885	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In Gupta's report, CNN had said that Moore had reported that Cuba spends $25 (euro18) per person for health care.
6886	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In fact, the movie estimates Cuba's spending at $251 (euro182) per person.
6887	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN blamed a transcription error for its mistake and apologized for it on and off the air.
6888	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network accuses Moore of "cherry-picking" numbers from different academic studies to make his arguments stronger.
6889	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN said it believes in essentially comparing apples with apples.
6890	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he tried to use the most recent data available.
6891	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore was also angry that Gupta interviewed Paul Keckley, who works for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, as a critic of "Sicko."
6892	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said Deloitte's chairman is Tommy Thompson, President George W. Bush's former health and human services secretary, and that Keckley had made political contributions to Republican candidates and organizations.
6893	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The second mistake came not in Gupta's original report -- where Keckley was correctly identified as representing Deloitte -- but in an on-air debate where Gupta claimed Keckley was working for Vanderbilt University.
6894	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"His only affiliation is with Vanderbilt University," Gupta said.
6895	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"We checked it, Michael.
6896	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We checked his conflict of interest.
6897	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We do ask those questions."
6898	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	While CNN noted Moore was correct in pointing out Keckley had left Vanderbilt last year, it said Keckley's comments were factual and descriptive.
6899	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Deloitte says it does not have a political agenda.
6900	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In other instances, CNN said Moore appeared to be creating a fight where none really existed.
6901	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network said it was comfortable letting viewers judge for themselves.
6902	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he believed it was important for him to let people know his side.
6903	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"In the report they say that I fudged the facts," he said, "and they didn't find a single fact that I fudged."

6908	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	New intelligence report: Al-Qaida may use Iraqi network to attack U.S.
6909	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-07-17 13:40:23 UTC
6910	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The terrorist network Al-Qaida will likely leverage its contacts and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S. soil, according to a new National Intelligence Estimate on threats to the United States.
6911	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The declassified key findings, to be released publicly on Tuesday, were obtained in advance by The Associated Press.
6912	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The report lays out a range of dangers -- from al-Qaida to Lebanese Hezbollah to non-Muslim radical groups -- that pose a "persistent and evolving threat" to the country over the next three years.
6913	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	As expected, however, the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
6914	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The report makes clear that al-Qaida in Iraq, which has not yet posed a direct threat to U.S. soil, could become a problem here.
6915	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"Of note," the analysts said, "we assess that al-Qaida will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of al- Qaida in Iraq (AQI), its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland."
6916	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The analysts also found that al-Qaida's association with its Iraqi affiliate helps the group to energize the broader Sunni Muslim extremist community, raise resources and recruit and indoctrinate operatives -- "including for homeland attacks."
6917	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments of the 16 spy agencies across the breadth of the U.S. government.
6918	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	These agencies reflect the consensus long- term thinking of top intelligence analysts.
6919	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Portions of the documents are occasionally declassified for public release.
6920	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The new report echoed statements made by senior intelligence officials over the last year, including the assessment of spy agencies that the country is in a "heightened threat environment."
6921	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It also provided new details on their thinking and concerns.
6922	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	For instance, the report says that worldwide counterterrorism efforts since 2001 have constrained al-Qaida's ability to attack the U.S. again and convinced terror groups that U.S. soil is a tougher target.
6923	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But, the report quickly adds, analysts are concerned "that this level of international cooperation may wane as 9/11 becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge."
6924	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Among the report's other findings:
6925	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Al-Qaida is likely to continue to focus on high-profile political, economic and infrastructure targets to cause mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, economic aftershocks and fear.
6926	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
6927	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--The group has been able to restore key capabilities it would need to launch an attack on U.S. soil: a safe haven in Pakistan's tribal areas, operational lieutenants and senior leaders.
6928	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have warned publicly that a deal between the Pakistani government and tribal leaders allowed al-Qaida to plot and train more freely in parts of western Pakistan for the last 10 months.
6929	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--The group will continue to seek weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological or nuclear material -- and "would not hesitate to use them."
6930	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Lebanese Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim extremist group that has conducted anti-American attacks overseas, may be more likely to consider attacking here, especially if it believes the United States is directly threatening the group or its main sponsor, Iran.
6931	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Non-Muslim terrorist groups probably will attack here in the next several years, although on a smaller scale.
6932	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The judgments do not name any specific groups, but the FBI often warns of violent environmental groups, such as Earth Liberation Front, and others.
6933	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are part of a longer document, which remains classified.
6934	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It was approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
6935	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	In the last week, reports on this document and another threat assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
6936	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The White House has used the reports as evidence that the country must continue to go after al-Qaida in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
6937	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But critics say the evolving threat is evidence of a policy gone wrong.
6938	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The debate -- and the underlying global problem -- will not go away soon.
6939	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas, especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is expanding.
6940	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ... points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate," the estimate said.
6941	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"We assess that this internal Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in Europe, however."

6943	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	company claims best quarterly growth since 2001
6944	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	BOSTON 2007-07-18 20:41:20 UTC
6945	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Second-quarter earnings at International Business Machines Corp. rose 12 percent and beat Wall Street forecasts Wednesday, largely on the strength of IBM's software division and improvement in its services unit.
6946	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	From April through June, the Armonk, New York-based technology bellwether earned $2.26 billion (euro1.64 billion), $1.55 (euro1.12) per share, on revenue of $23.8 billion (euro17.27 billion).
6947	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the comparable period last year, IBM earned $2.02 billion (euro1.47 billion), $1.30 (euro.94) per share, on revenue of $21.9 billion (euro15.89 billion).
6948	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	This year's quarterly numbers were boosted $81 million (euro58.79 million), or 5 cents per share, from the sale of IBM's printing division to Ricoh Co.
6949	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Without that gain, IBM would have earned $1.50 (euro1.09) per share, beating the estimate of $1.47 (euro1.07) expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
6950	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Analysts were expecting revenue of $23.1 billion (euro16.76 billion).
6951	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's overall sales growth of 9 percent in the second quarter would have been 6 percent if not for weakness in the dollar.
6952	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Softness in the greenback makes deals done in other currencies translate into more dollars.
6953	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's chairman and CEO, Samuel Palmisano, said the performance marked IBM's best quarterly revenue growth since 2001.
6954	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The company's overall profit margins also increased slightly.
6955	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's shares surged to multiyear highs this week after some analysts predicted IBM would exceed Wall Street's forecast.
6956	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Before the earnings report came out Wednesday, IBM stock gained 31 cents to close at $111.08.
6957	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In after-hours trading, shares gained $1.17.
6958	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	One common gauge of IBM's health is services contract signings, because it foretells huge chunks of revenue that will be booked in future quarters.
6959	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's services division inked $11.7 billion (euro8.49 billion) in contracts in the second quarter, compared with an unusually soft $9.6 billion (euro6.97 billion) a year ago.
6960	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Revenue actually booked in the second quarter rose 10 percent to $13.1 billion (euro9.51 billion).
6961	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's hardware division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $5.1 billion (euro3.7 billion), though it would have been flat if not for currency fluctuations.
6962	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Software is IBM's smallest unit but accounts for an outsized portion of IBM's profit.
6963	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	That has prompted the company to make dozens of acquisitions to bolster its security and business- management offerings, including this week's $161 million (euro116.84 million) deal for DataMirror Corp.
6964	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM software revenue grew 13 percent to $4.8 billion (euro3.48 billion) in the second quarter, and pre-tax profit was $1.25 billion (euro0.91 billion), just slightly less than what the much bigger services arm generated.
6965	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The sales growth would have been 9 percent at constant currency rates.
6966	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the first six months of the year, IBM earned $4.11 billion (euro2.98 billion), $2.75 (euro2) per share, with revenue of $45.8 billion (euro33.24 billion).
6967	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Those numbers all rose from the first half of 2006, when IBM showed profit of $3.73 billion (euro2.71 billion), $2.37 (euro1.72) per share, and revenue of $42.5 billion (euro30.84 billion).

6971	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-07-23 11:39:35 UTC
6972	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	EU nations sought Monday to maintain their unity in the face of growing tensions between the United States and Russia over the future of Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo.
6973	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	"It's important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for a strong European leadership but also strong European unity in this area," Britain's Foreign Secretary David Miliband said as he arrived for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers.
6974	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The EU's 27 members have been generally united in their support for a U.N. resolution that would empower the union to deploy its mission to the province and replace the current U.N. administration there.
6975	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Still, some members such as Spain, Slovakia, Greece and Cyprus have expressed reservations about the prospect of Kosovo gaining independence without a Security Council resolution -- unlikely in the face of Russian opposition -- and there are concerns that the EU could split over the issue if it is remains unresolved.
6976	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The conference in Brussels comes just days after the United States and the EU were forced to withdraw from the U.N. Security Council their latest draft of a resolution on Kosovo's future.
6977	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Russia, a veto-wielding member of the council, opposed the resolution on the grounds that it was a hidden route to independence.
6978	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Instead, Washington and Brussels will try to open a new round of talks between Serbia and its independence-seeking province through a multinational group outside the Security Council known as the Contact Group on Kosovo, which includes representatives from the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia.
6979	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The United Nations assumed control of Kosovo after a NATO-led air war halted a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province in 1999.
6980	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The world body, which has since then administered the region of two million people -- 90 percent of them Albanians -- is seeking a way to resolve Kosovo's final status.
6981	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, former Finnish president and U.N. special envoy Martti Ahtisaari recommended that the province be granted limited independence, to be supervised by a team of European Union officials.
6982	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Washington and the EU have backed the plan, which both Moscow and Belgrade strongly oppose, arguing that granting independence to Kosovo -- which technically remains part of Serbia -- would set a precedent for separatists around the globe.
6983	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	"Our own commitment to the Ahtisaari plan remains very strong," said Miliband, who was attending his first EU ministerial conference.
6984	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier proposed that the Contact Group be made more effective by appointing a single EU envoy to represent the union instead of Britain, France, Italy, Germany.

6996	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK (AP) -- With so many jokes and cartoons about Sigmund Freud floating around, one gets the impression that psychoanalysis is no longer valid as a serious tool of psychological inquiry, but a closer look shows that it is just the opposite.
6997	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Nearly 70 years after his death, Freud's spiritual heirs are still turning out learned papers with great enthusiasm, attempting to shed light into the dark recesses of the human mind.
6998	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Providing a perfect forum for them is "The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child," an annual started in 1945 by Anna Freud, the icon's psychoanalyst daughter, and her colleagues.
6999	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The title seems to suggest that it only pertains to children, but actually, it brims with articles of great human interest and originality on topics that range from infancy to grandfatherhood, from the origins of aggression to the mysteries of human resilience.
7000	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The volume is divided into five categories: Clinical Contributions
7001	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The Child Analyst at Work

7005	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Of particular interest to the general readership is probably the last one, which deals with the psychoanalytic investigation of movies, literature, philosophy and religion, among others.
7006	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	An article by Eugene J. Mahon, M.D., a training and supervising analyst at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute in New York, for example, offers an intriguing view of "purgatory."
7007	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Purgatory as a concept was not always with us, he states.
7008	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	It was "invented" by the human mind several hundred years ago to get it out of the dilemma that the absolute concepts -- Heaven and Hell -- had created for themselves in the first place, he theorizes.
7009	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	He implies provocatively that this theological concept may have unwittingly influenced Freud, who was an atheist, when he began to reflect on the unconscious dimensions of guilt and human morality as he set about "inventing" his own famous concept, the Superego, the internal moral voice.
7010	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Throughout the volume, the contributors from the United States, Israel, Switzerland and England mull over such intriguing questions as why certain infants pull their hair out

7015	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	This inspiring collection of articles offers psychoanalytic thinking at its best, and anyone who is interested in the workings of a complex apparatus called the psyche will find it a very worthy companion.

7017	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-07-31 16:04:26 UTC
7018	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The French government forecast a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of gross domestic product next year, down from a projected 2.4 percent for 2007, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Tuesday.
7019	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	Fillon also announced plans to stimulate the economy that include a drastic trimming of the civil servants corps.
7020	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The government plans to inject euro10 billion (US$13.7 billion) to boost the French economy next year, along with public sector modernization and improvement in labor market mobility, Fillon told a news conference.
7021	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	France will begin trimming the ranks of civil servants.
7022	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	It will not replace the 22,700 civil servants who will be retiring -- nearly double the 12,000 who were not replaced this year, Fillon said.
7023	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The announcement was in line with the government's aim of replacing only one public employee for every two who retire in a bid to trim spending.
7024	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	Fillon told reporters that the 2008 budget is based on an inflation-adjusted growth rate forecast to be 2.5 percent and an inflation rate of 1.6 percent.
7025	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	Commenting on the latest drop in unemployment, which fell to 8 percent in June, Fillon noted the rate was the lowest in 25 years but stressed that the government wants to reduce it further, to 5 percent by 2012.
7026	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The government's effort is up against the weight of France's debt service burden, which the prime minister said is rising due to higher interest rates.

7028	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-08-01 22:24:38 UTC
7029	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A group of family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outraged by city plans to move the commemoration ceremony, filed a request Wednesday asking to hold the annual event at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.
7030	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The coalition filed the request with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site.
7031	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The agency says construction at the site would make a ceremony there unsafe, but family members plan to sue if they are denied.
7032	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"This is the place we have.
7033	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A precedent has been set in letting us touch ground zero," said Diane Horning, a representative of one of the family groups.
7034	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Rosaleen Tallon, of Advocates for a 9/11 Fallen Heroes Memorial, said remains of people killed in the 2001 terror attack are still being found at the site.
7035	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"How can we possibly not go there to memorialize these people?"
7036	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	she said.
7037	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It is still their resting place, and I want to be there."
7038	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The city has said that ground zero, now undergoing reconstruction, is not safe for the large annual gathering, and it plans to move the recitation of names to a nearby plaza.
7039	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Relatives of the victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks will have some access to the site -- just not to the pit and not for a ceremony, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
7040	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It's just not safe," Bloomberg said.
7041	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"Listen, we've had enough tragedy on that site.
7042	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Our first priority, No. 1, is to make sure that everybody's safe, and nothing's going to get us off that."
7043	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Attorney Norman Siegel, who is representing the families, said that if the Port Authority rejects the permit, the families would consider a federal lawsuit on First Amendment grounds.
7044	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	He said the groups had gotten consultations on safety and security and that the site would be safe as long as the construction was halted the day of the ceremony.
7045	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Port Authority spokesman Stephen Sigmund said construction would be stopped that day but the site still was not suitable for the ceremony.
7046	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"As an agency that lost 84 friends and colleagues on September 11, the Port Authority is sensitive to the needs of those who lost loved ones," he said.
7047	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"We are actively looking at ways to accommodate family members who want to pay their respects on the World Trade Center site on 9/11, but the substantial construction activity and current site conditions will not allow the formal ceremony to be safely conducted on the site."
7048	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Every year, the names of the dead have been read aloud from a platform along the western edge of the lower Manhattan site.
7049	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The roll call stops only for moments of silence at the times the two planes hit and the twin towers collapsed.
7050	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	During the reading, and throughout the rest of the day, families have had access to the seven-story pit that was once the basement of the twin towers, where they would lay flowers.
7051	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg said family members will be able to leave flowers in an area along the southern edge of the site, but they will not be allowed into the pit.
7052	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"There isn't a place to do that anymore, unfortunately, and next year there will be even less," he said.
7053	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"The next time you'll be able to have a ceremony on the site is really when we complete the memorial."
7054	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Construction on the memorial began last year, and it is expected to open in 2009.

7058	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky 2007-08-04 16:03:42 UTC
7059	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	A military jury heard arguments Saturday about whether a soldier who was to be sentenced to life in prison in the slayings of a 14 -year-old Iraqi girl and her family should be eligible for parole.
7060	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Jurors deliberated much of Friday evening before convicting Pfc. Jesse Spielman, 22, of conspiracy to commit rape, rape, housebreaking with intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder, despite testimony that cast doubt on his involvement.
7061	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman, of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, faces a mandatory life sentence, but the jury could allow him to become eligible for parole
7062	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He was charged in connection with the March 12, 2006, rape and slaying of Abeer Qassim al-Janabi and the killings of her family.
7063	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The attack took place in Mahmoudiya, a village about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Baghdad.
7064	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Military prosecutors did not say Spielman took part in the rape or murders, but alleged he went to the house knowing what the others intended to do and served as a lookout.
7065	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman had pleaded guilty on Monday to lesser charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, arson, wrongfully touching a corpse and drinking.
7066	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman's grandmother, Nancy Hess, collapsed outside the courtroom after the verdict was read and prosecutor Maj. William Fischbach ran to her side and called the emergency dispatcher.
7067	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Soldiers in Spielman's unit fanned the woman with napkins.
7068	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman's sister, Paige Gerlach, screamed: "I hate the government.
7069	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	You people put him (in Iraq) and now, this happened."
7070	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Defense attorneys left the courthouse immediately following the verdict and could not immediately be reached for comment.
7071	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors rested their case Thursday amid struggles to overcome a fellow soldier's recanting of a story that Spielman acted as a lookout during the attack last year.
7072	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spc. James Barker, who has admitted his own role in the assault, said in earlier testimony that he had allowed investigators to draft sworn statements for him that implicated Spielman in the crime.
7073	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker testified Wednesday that several portions of the document were untrue, including references to Spielman's role in the conspiracy to attack the family and his knowledge of plans to rape the girl.
7074	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	But another soldier convicted in the attack, Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, testified that Spielman stood guard as his fellow soldiers raped the girl.
7075	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Cortez said Spielman was within a few feet of the others as they held down the screaming girl but did nothing to stop them.
7076	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker, Cortez and another soldier, Pfc. Bryan L. Howard, pleaded guilty for their roles in the slayings and received sentences of five to 100 years under plea agreements with prosecutors.
7077	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Steven D. Green, who was discharged from the Army before being charged, faces a possible death sentence when he is tried in federal court in Kentucky.
7078	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include murder and sexual assault.
7079	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker and Cortez have given investigators conflicting statements about whether Spielman knew of the plan to rape the girl and was present when they discussed it over swigs from bottles of whiskey and gin mixed with energy drinks, according to testimony.
7080	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	During their courts-martial, Barker and Cortez testified they took turns raping the girl while Green shot and killed her mother, father and younger sister.
7081	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Green shot the girl in the head after raping her, they said.
7082	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The girl's body was set on fire with kerosene to destroy the evidence, according to previous testimony.

7085	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	2007-08-05 17:48:03 UTC
7086	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM -- Elderly Holocaust survivors demonstrated outside Israel's parliament Sunday, demanding the Jewish state increase what they say is a derisory $20 monthly stipend.
7087	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Six decades after World War II, about 240,000 survivors live in Israel and many say that instead of spending their final years in dignity, they lack money for medicines, psychological treatment and in some cases even for food.
7088	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Josef Charney was 17 when a cargo train carried him from the Warsaw ghetto to the Treblinka death camp, the yellow star on his chest marking him as a Jew targeted for eradication by the Nazis.
7089	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Now 82, Charney donned a yellow star once again on Sunday to protest Israel's treatment of its Holocaust survivors.
7090	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Charney was among at least 500 survivors and supporters who rallied outside the parliament building, carrying placards and wearing stickers reading "The Holocaust is still here" and "Forgive us for surviving."
7091	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"I want (the government) to let them die with peace and dignity," Charney said, adding that he was marching for survivors not well enough to come themselves.
7092	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"The government of Israel has not recognized us.
7093	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	We don't belong to them."
7094	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and hundreds of thousands who survived concentration camps came to Israel after the war.
7095	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Many suffered physical or psychological damage from the torture and deprivation they suffered at the hands of the Nazis.
7096	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	The current flare-up over Israel's treatment of Holocaust survivors began last week, when the government announced $28 million in new stipends for 120,000 needy survivors -- about half of those now in Israel.
7097	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	That works out to just 83 shekels -- or $20 -- a month for each survivor, a sum critics deemed woefully inadequate.
7098	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We don't think that 83 shekels a month is enough" said Gal Rotem of the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund, which helped organize the march.
7099	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"You can't buy food or drugs or anything else with 83 shekels."
7100	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	By definition an elderly group, many of whom are unwell, an average of 35 of the survivors die each day, she added.
7101	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	At Sunday's weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the issue was "sensitive and painful" and acknowledged that previous governments had failed to address it.
7102	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	He added that he would meet Wednesday with representatives of survivors' groups and the heads of various government ministries to find the "best, fairest and most just solution," a statement from his office quoted him as saying.
7103	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Sunday's protesters, however, doubted the government would act quickly.
7104	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"Until they say what the solution is, we won't believe anything else," Rotem said.
7105	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"It's not a good feeling that Holocaust survivors have to walk and march to say to Olmert that they are still alive and need help."
7106	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Others expressed sadness that Israeli has not helped survivors more.
7107	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Walking arm-in-arm with her granddaughter, 76-year old Brana Fogel said she entered Auschwitz with her six brothers and sisters.
7108	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Only two of them survived the infamous extermination camp.
7109	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	In 1951 Fogel came to Israel, where her whole family now lives.
7110	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"My revenge is to be here in Israel with daughter and granddaughter," she said.
7111	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"But thinking about how other survivors live...my heart just hurts."
7112	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We can't imagine what they went through," added her daughter, Yardit Ishai.
7113	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"I can't stand the thought that someone who was hungry, that someone who was almost killed, is hungry today."

7121	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	A zookeeper needed more than 100 stitches after a 3-year-old panda viciously bit and scratched him during feeding time at a zoo in northwestern China, a newspaper reported Monday.
7122	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	The zookeeper, surnamed Zhang, was hospitalized after the attack Saturday at a zoo in Lanzhou, Gansu province, but his life was not in danger, the Lanzhou Morning Post reported.
7123	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	Zhang was feeding the panda from outside the enclosure, sticking his arms through the wire, when the panda, Lan Zai, grabbed his arms and began biting them and then scratched his legs, the newspaper reported.
7124	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	Lan Zai was transferred to the zoo on July 28 from Chengdu in southwestern China and, apparently not adjusting well to Lanzhou's drier climate, had refused to eat for several days, it said.
7125	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	The panda also had not grown comfortable with Zhang during its weeklong stay at the zoo, it reported.

7132	APW_ENG_20070808.1054.LDC2009T13	The DST counterintelligence service opened an investigation into the suspected threat after Luxembourg tipped off France's Interior Ministry overnight, the Paris prosecutor's office said.

7140	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The Bank of Canada took an unusual step Thursday of publicly reassuring investors that it will help provide stability to financial markets and the domestic financial system.
7141	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	"In light of current market conditions, the Bank of Canada would like to assure financial market participants and the public that it will provide liquidity to support the stability of the Canadian financial system and the continued functioning of financial markets," the central bank said in a brief statement.
7142	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	Although these activities are part of the bank's normal operations, it affirmed that it is closely monitoring developments, and will deal with issues as they arise.
7143	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The bank's increased participation in the money markets stems from Thursday's turbulent Canadian and U.S. stock market activity.
7144	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The markets were further impacted after French bank BNP Paribas SA announced the suspension of three asset-backed securities funds, saying it could not value them accurately.
7145	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	That sent stocks lower in Europe and the United States as investors looked for safer havens such as Treasurys.
7146	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The Bank of Canada's statement follows news that the European Central Bank (ECB) lent nearly euro95 billion (US$130 billion) in overnight funds to banks at a bargain rate of 4 percent on Thursday, putting more cash into a global financial system jolted by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.

7150	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Wall Street's deepening fears about a spreading credit crunch sent stocks plunging again, with the Dow Jones industrials extending their series of triple-digit swings and falling more than 380 points.
7151	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The catalyst for the market's latest skid: a French bank's announcement that it was freezing three funds that invested in U.S. subprime mortgages.
7152	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The announcement by BNP Paribas raised the specter of a widening impact of U.S. credit market problems Thursday.
7153	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The idea that anyone -- institutions, investors, companies, individuals -- cannot get money when they need it unnerved a stock market that has suffered through weeks of volatility triggered by concerns about tight credit and bad subprime mortgages.
7154	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	A move by the European Central Bank to provide more cash to money markets intensified Wall Street's angst.
7155	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Although the bank's loan of more than $130 billion (euro94.69 billion) in overnight funds to banks at a low rate of 4 percent was intended to calm investors, Wall Street saw it as confirmation of the credit markets' problems.
7156	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	It was the ECB's biggest injection ever.
7157	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve added a larger-than-normal $24 billion (euro17.48 billion) in temporary reserves to the U.S. banking system.
7158	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The concerns that arose in Europe and spilled onto Wall Street underscored the potential worldwide ramifications of an implosion of some subprime loans and perhaps also weakened arguments that strength in the global economy could help keep profit growth going in the U.S. among large companies that do business overseas.
7159	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The ECB's injection of money into the system is an unprecedented move, said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck &amp
7160	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Co., adding that it shows that problems in subprime lending are, in fact, spreading into the general economy.

7163	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	On top of this, retail sales were mediocre, which shows that indeed, the housing collapse is affecting the consumer."
7164	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Retailers released July sales figures Thursday that were overall disappointing.
7165	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The Fed did not soften its stance on inflation after leaving short-term interest rates unchanged Tuesday.
7166	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	However, the renewed credit market concerns spurred bond traders who bet on its next move to predict that the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next month.

7186	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The pullback came after a BNP Paribas unit said it was suspending three funds together worth about $3.79 billion (euro2.76 billion) and wouldn't make investor redemptions until it could determine net asset values.

7252	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Rescuers dug through the muddy wreckage of collapsed clay houses in northwest Iraq on Wednesday, uncovering at least 200 bodies from suicide truck bombings the U.S. military blamed on al-Qaida.
7253	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The victims were members of a small Kurdish sect -- the Yazidis -- sometimes attacked by Muslim extremists who consider them infidels.
7254	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Four suicide truck bombers struck nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, killing more people than any other concerted attack since Nov. 23, when 215 people were killed by mortar fire and five car bombs in Baghdad's Shiite Muslim enclave of Sadr City.
7255	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was most vicious attack yet against the Yazidis, an ancient religious community in the region.
7256	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Some 300 people were wounded in the blasts, said Dakhil Qassim, the mayor of the nearby town of Sinjar.
7257	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Qassim said four trucks approached the town of Qahataniya, 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city, from dirt roads and all exploded within minutes of each other.
7258	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	He said the casualty tolls were expected to rise.
7259	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We are still digging with our hands and shovels because we can't use cranes because many of the houses were built of clay," Qassim said.
7260	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We are expecting to reach the final death toll tomorrow or day after tomorrow as we are getting only pieces of bodies."
7261	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	U.S. military spokesman Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner said Wednesday that he believed the bombings were the work of al-Qaida.
7262	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"The car bombs that were used all had the consistent profile of al-Qaida in Iraq violence," Bergner told reporters in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone.
7263	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We're continuing to investigate, and we'll learn more in the coming days."
7264	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The bombings came as extremists staged other bold attacks on Tuesday: leveling a key bridge outside Baghdad and abducting five officials from an Oil Ministry compound in the capital in a raid using gunmen dressed as security officers.
7265	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Nine U.S. soldiers also were reported killed, including five in a helicopter crash.
7266	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The carnage dealt a serious blow to U.S. efforts to pacify the country with just weeks to go before the top U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker are to deliver a pivotal report to the U.S. Congress amid a fierce debate over whether to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq.
7267	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker issued a joint statement Wednesday condemning the "barbaric attacks on innocent Iraqi men, women and children in Ninevah province yesterday."
7268	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Just last month, Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, the commander of U.S. forces in northern Iraq, said he proposed reducing American troop levels in Ninevah, where he said Iraqi army forces were operating nearly independently.
7269	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	At the time, he predicted the province would shift to Iraqi government control as early as this month.
7270	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was unclear whether that projection would hold, after Tuesday's staggering death tolls.
7271	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Arab League also issued condolences Wednesday, in a statement saying "the best way out of this circle of violence is to go ahead with steady steps toward national reconciliation."
7272	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials believe extremists are attempting to regroup across northern Iraq after being driven from strongholds in and around Baghdad, and commanders have warned they expected Sunni insurgents to step up attacks in a bid to upstage the report.
7273	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Yazidis comprise a primarily Kurdish religious sect with ancient roots, that worships an angel figure considered to be the devil by some Muslims and Christians.
7274	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Yazidis, who don't believe in hell or evil, deny that.
7275	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Islamic State in Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, distributed leaflets a week ago warning residents near the scene of Tuesday's bombings that an attack was imminent because Yazidis are "anti- Islamic."
7276	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The sect has been under fire since some members stoned a Yazidi teenager to death in April.

7278	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	A grainy video showing gruesome scenes of the woman's killing was later posted on Iraqi Web sites.
7279	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Its authenticity could not be independently verified, but recent attacks on Yazidis have been blamed on al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents seeking revenge.
7280	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	A curfew was in place Wednesday across towns west of Mosul, and U.S. and Iraqi forces were conducting house-to-house searches in response to the bombings, according to Iraqi police and Army officers who spoke on condition of anonymity out of security concerns.
7281	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Twenty suspects were arrested, they said.
7282	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the U.S. military heralded success in Day Two of a nationwide offensive against Sunni insurgents with links to al- Qaida and Shiite militiamen.
7283	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Ten thousand U.S. troops and 6,000 Iraqi soldiers were involved in air and ground assaults across Diyala and Salahuddin provinces, both north of Baghdad.
7284	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, U.S. troops killed 11 suspected terrorists and detained four others in operations against al-Qaida in central and northern Iraq, the military said in a statement.
7285	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	More than 300 artillery rounds, rockets and bombs were dropped in the Diyala River valley late Monday and early Tuesday, another statement said.
7286	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Three suspected al-Qaida gunmen were killed and eight were taken prisoner, the military said.
7287	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	American troops also discovered several roadside bombs rigged to explode, as well as a booby-trapped house, it said.
7288	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	In the Iraqi capital, U.S. special forces and Iraqi soldiers detained three suspected al-Qaida in Iraq leaders and four Shiite militia suspects in separate raids Tuesday, the military said.
7289	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Another Shiite extremist accused of attacking U.S. forces was captured the same day in Najaf, a Shiite holy city 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, it said in a statement.
7290	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Thousands of followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr took to the streets in Najaf in a peaceful protest against the detention.
7291	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and called for an end to what they called random raids and rights violations targeting the movement.
7292	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military issued another statement Wednesday putting the death toll in the Yazidi bombings at 60.
7293	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	But the Iraqi estimate was based on body counts from local hospitals and morgues to which U.S. officials had no access so the total was believed to be higher.
7294	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki issued a statement Wednesday blaming the bombings on "terrorism powers who seek to fuel sectarian strife and damage our people's national unity."
7295	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"These crimes will not prevent us from standing up to challenges and moving ahead with the political process to impose law and bring criminals and outlaws to justice," the statement said.
7296	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said U.S. helicopters swooped in to evacuate wounded to hospitals in Dahuk, a Kurdish city near the Turkish border about 90 kilometers (60 miles) north of Qahataniya.
7297	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Civilian cars and ambulances also rushed injured to hospitals in Dahuk, police said.

7307	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	MONTEBELLO, Quebec 2007-08-20 14:33:21 UTC
7308	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Canada's prime minister is expected to assert his nation's claim to the fabled Northwest Passage through the warming, resource- rich Arctic at talks with the presidents of the United States and Mexico starting Monday.
7309	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Canada claimed the passage in 1973 but competition to control the Arctic has intensified with global warming.
7310	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Shrinking polar ice has raised the possibility of new shipping lanes and development of what one U.S. study suggested could be as much as 25 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas.
7311	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Russia sent two small submarines to plant a tiny national flag under the North Pole this month.
7312	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Denmark sent a team of scientists to the Arctic ice pack this month to seek evidence that the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater mountain range, is attached to the Danish territory of Greenland.
7313	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper went to the Arctic earlier this month and announced Canada will build a new army training center and a deep-water port in the Northwest passage.
7314	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The summit involving Harper, U.S. President George W. Bush and Mexican President Felipe Calderon is largely about expanding economic cooperation among the three nations, but Harper will assert Canada's claim during a private meeting with Bush, Canadian officials said at a press briefing on the summit.
7315	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	As the summit approached, Calderon was considering cutting his trip short to return to Mexico, where Hurricane Dean was poised to slam into the coastline.
7316	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Calderon will make a decision about his plans once the hurricane draws closer to Mexico, his press office said.
7317	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The United States and Norway also have claims in the Arctic, and the U.S. says the passage is not Canadian.
7318	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"It is a strait for international navigation," U.S. Ambassador David Wilkins said in an interview.
7319	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"That's not a unique view of the United States.
7320	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	That is the view shared by a majority of the countries in the world."
7321	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Bush's previous U.S. ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci, however, argued that the U.S. should acknowledge the Northwest Passage as Canadian.
7322	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Such a stance would allow the Canadian navy to patrol the area, monitor shipping and guard against potential terrorism and weapons smuggling, he said.
7323	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"I think, in the age of terrorism, it's in our security interests that the Northwest Passage be considered part of Canada," Cellucci, a Bush appointee who left the position in 2005, told Canadian television.
7324	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Harper has said Canada's new military installations will help back up Canada's claim to the waters and natural resources of the Northwest Passage, which runs below the North Pole from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago.
7325	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Stephen Clarkson, a political scientist at the University of Toronto, said bringing up the Arctic is a way for Harper to show Canadians he's not too close to the unpopular president.
7326	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"It's a gratuitous way to create a little distance between himself and Bush," Clarkson said.
7327	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Bush will meet privately with Calderon at Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello, a small summer retreat on the banks of the Ottawa river.
7328	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The U.S. government is poised to offer a major aid plan to Mexico to fight drug trafficking and violence.
7329	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Bush may announce part or all the proposal during the summit if the details are completed in time.
7330	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The effort is expected to help pay for equipment and training.
7331	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	For Bush, the summit with Canada and Mexico allows him to show he does not take his neighbors for granted
7332	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	they are both vital trading partners and energy providers for the U.S.
7333	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"The message for Canada and Mexico is that despite the ongoing emphasis on Iraq and terrorism in U.S. foreign policy ... the U.S. is investing time and attention on relationships with our own region," said Chris Sands, a scholar of North American studies and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
7334	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The partnership of the countries is a framework for working out problems -- not a deal that was ever intended to produce dramatic announcements.
7335	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	None are expected at the summit.
7336	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Personally, Bush shares plenty of views with Harper and Calderon, two fellow conservatives and free-market advocates who have come into power during his second term.
7337	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	It is not all cheery.
7338	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The summit is drawing protests from critics of Canada's troop presence in Afghanistan and of the partnership among the three countries.

7345	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	XINTAI, China 2007-08-21 06:34:51 UTC
7346	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Families of more than 180 miners trapped in flooded coal mines in eastern China and presumed dead lashed out at one of the companies Tuesday, complaining it had ignored safety warnings to close.
7347	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Rescue workers were pumping water in a bid to reach 172 miners missing for four days in the Huayuan mine and nine others in a smaller mine run by another company "despite dim hopes for anyone to survive," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
7348	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The miners have been trapped since Friday afternoon when a dike collapsed, several hours after other mines in the area had pulled their workers to the surface because of flooding fears.
7349	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"The news reports say it is a natural disaster because of the rain, but the accident is because of the mine management.
7350	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Every year there is flooding," said Ma Xiumei, who came with her sister to the mine headquarters in Xintai, Shandong province, for information about their missing brother.
7351	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"If these miners are safely brought home we won't say a thing, but if it is the worst then they (the company) need to think about my younger brother's laid-off wife, his children, his aging mother," said Ma Xiuhua.
7352	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	At least two other mines in the area have said that worries about unusually heavy rains had prompted them to shut down Friday morning, raising questions about why the Huayuan Mining Co. continued to operate.
7353	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The state-run China Daily also reported Tuesday that relatives were complaining about "human error."
7354	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It quoted one worker as saying the mine had flooded every year since 2002.
7355	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Huayuan also reportedly received six phone calls from the Xintai Administration for Work Safety on Friday, before the accident, but took no action," the newspaper reported.
7356	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It said the administration urged local mines to stop production and evacuate mines during torrential rainstorms.
7357	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It also quoted Huayuan's deputy general manager, Zhang Canjun, as rejecting the allegation, saying it was "absolutely impossible," without elaborating.
7358	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Calls to the company and to the safety administration were not answered Tuesday.
7359	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The company and local government appeared to be isolating families and pressuring them to keep their anger in check after one family attacked a Huayuan office with sticks on Monday.
7360	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some neighborhoods with a lot of mining families have been sealed off, with plain-clothed guards keeping outsiders away.
7361	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some families have also been taken away and put up in hotels in the main center of Xintai, a 15-minute drive from the mining company offices.
7362	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	One person who managed to sneak away from a hotel said the families had been told not to talk to each other.
7363	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	While the Ma sisters were speaking to a reporter, a woman with short-cropped hair and wearing white pants and a white shirt with a black leopard-spot pattern pulled Ma Xiumei aside.
7364	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Don't make a big thing about this, you have to think about your brother's job," the woman said.
7365	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Ma Xiumei said the woman worked for the mining company.
7366	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Security officials have also been trailing reporters in Xintai, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of Beijing.
7367	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Large-scale accidents like the mine flood present a test for the communist leadership under President Hu Jintao to prove it can deliver on pledges to improve farmers' and workers' lives.

7369	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Coal feeds most of China's energy needs, and accidents kill an average of 13 miners a day.
7370	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Tempers among the miners' families boiled over Monday.
7371	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Several relatives of a missing miner used wooden sticks to smash a reception window and display cases at a company office.

7374	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 2007-08-21 17:10:33 UTC
7375	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a hurricane.
7376	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The space shuttle swooped out of the partly cloudy sky and touched down on the runway at 12:32 p.m. (1632 GMT).
7377	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	"Congratulations.
7378	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Welcome home.
7379	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	You've given a new meaning to higher education," Mission Control told commander Scott Kelly and his crew, which included teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan.
7380	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The main concern for much of the mission was the gouge to Endeavour's protective tiles.
7381	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA did not want the shuttle to suffer any structural damage that, while not catastrophic, might require lengthy postflight repairs.
7382	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Over the past few days and right up until landing, NASA had stressed that the 3 1/2-inch-long 3.5 (8.9-centimeter-long) gouge in Endeavour's belly would not endanger the shuttle during its landing.
7383	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a damaged wing on shuttle Columbia had allowed hot gases to seep in during the re-entry, tearing the shuttle apart.
7384	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	There was zero chance of a Columbia-style catastrophe this time, NASA managers insisted, although they acknowledged re-entry was always risky.
7385	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that the spacecraft would hold up.
7386	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	With its pilots reporting no problems, Endeavour zoomed over the South Pacific, crossed Central America and Cuba, then headed up the Florida peninsula into Kennedy Space Center.
7387	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Its trip spanned 13 days and 5.3 million miles (8.53 million kilometers).
7388	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station visit short because of Hurricane Dean.
7389	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	At the time, NASA was uncertain if Dean would veer toward Texas and threaten Houston, home to Mission Control.
7390	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Even though forecasters later put Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.
7391	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	During Endeavour's liftoff on Aug. 8, a piece of foam insulation or ice had broken off a bracket on the external fuel tank, fell onto a strut lower on the tank and then bounced into the shuttle, gashing its tiles.
7392	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The astronauts inspected the especially vulnerable areas Sunday, after undocking from the international space station.
7393	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA on Monday cleared Endeavour for landing after engineers finished evaluating the latest laser images of the shuttle's wings and nose and concluded there were no holes or cracks from micrometeorites or space junk.
7394	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Brackets have shed debris in launches since Columbia, but it was not until Endeavour's flight that such debris caused noticeable damage again.
7395	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damage triggered a weeklong analyses that involved hundreds of engineers and thousands of hours of supercomputer simulations.
7396	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the problem is solved.
7397	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	For now, Discovery is supposed to lift off in late October.
7398	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	While in orbit, the astronauts attached a new truss segment to the space station and replaced a failed gyroscope needed for keeping the outpost headed in the right direction.
7399	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	They also delivered 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of supplies.
7400	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The crew completed four spacewalks, two of which were cut short.
7401	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	One was halted after a spacewalking astronaut noticed a cut in his glove.
7402	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The other was abbreviated to give the crew enough time to prepare for an early departure from the space station.
7403	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The rest of the crew includes pilot Charles Hobaugh and mission specialists Alvin Drew, Tracy Caldwell, Dave Williams and Rick Mastracchio.

7409	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Republican senator will not seek sixth term, offering valuable opportunity to Democrats in US Congress
7410	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia 2007-08-31 19:58:23 UTC
7411	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia, one of the most authoritative voices in the U.S. Congress on the military and a key figure in the debate over Iraq, said Friday he will not seek a sixth term in 2008.
7412	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, 80, has held the seat since 1979, when the dashing former U.S. Navy secretary campaigned alongside his wife at the time, Elizabeth Taylor.
7413	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner is leaving what would have been a safe seat for the Republicans if he had chosen to run again.
7414	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His departure gives Democrats a better chance to protect or even expand their one- seat majority in the U.S. Senate.
7415	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, became a respected voice on the Iraq war because of his cautious views and loyalty to President George W. Bush, as well as his expertise on national security issues.
7416	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	After returning from the Iraq last week, Warner suggested that some troops should leave by the end of the year.
7417	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His remarks roiled the White House, and Bush administration officials asked him to clarify that he had not broken politically with the president.
7418	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner stood by his comments.
7419	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, a courtly senator with chiseled features and a full shock of gray hair, chose a sentimental setting for his announcement: the steps of the University of Virginia's signature structure, the Rotunda, designed by school founder Thomas Jefferson.
7420	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner graduated from the university's law school in 1953.
7421	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	The Republican Party nominated Warner for the Senate in 1978 and Warner was elected by the razor-thin margin of 4,721 votes out of 1.2 million cast.
7422	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	He was easily re-elected in 1984 and 1990.
7423	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"Public service is a privilege and I urge all to try to find time some time in their lifetime to serve the needs of others," Warner said Friday.
7424	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"I have tried to be not only true to myself, but true to the people of this great commonwealth I've served for 29 years now."
7425	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she will miss her "friend and colleague."
7426	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"At a time when the tone in Washington is so often defined by partisanship and rancor, Senator Warner has always risen above the fray, focused on what he believed was the right course for our nation," Clinton said.

7428	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	LA CEIBA, Honduras 2007-09-04 12:22:52 UTC
7429	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Hurricane Felix slammed into Nicaragua's Miskito Coast as a record-breaking Category 5 monster storm Tuesday in an area home to thousands of stranded Miskito Indians.
7430	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, off Mexico's Pacific coast, Tropical Storm Henriette strengthened into a hurricane with 120 kph (75 mph) winds and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was plowing toward the upscale resort of Cabo San Lucas, popular with Hollywood stars and sea fishing enthusiasts.
7431	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Felix landed around dawn at Punta Gorda with winds of about 260 kph (160 mph), only two weeks after Hurricane Dean struck Mexico, further up the Caribbean coast.
7432	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	It was first time that two Category 5 hurricanes have hit land in a season since 1886, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
7433	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Only 31 such storms have been recorded in the Atlantic, including eight in the last five seasons.
7434	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Nicaragua's Civil Defense chief, Rogelio Flores, said 2,000 people were evacuated before the hurricane blew roofs off homes, blocked roads and knocked out telephone service.
7435	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	But many other Miskito Indians refused to leave low-lying areas and head to shelters set up in schools.
7436	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Twenty fishermen were missing, the newspaper La Prensa reported.
7437	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Communication to the area was largely cut off, making it difficult to find out what was happening as the storm's winds began hitting the remote, swampy area, much of it reachable only by canoe.
7438	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The Nicaraguan government sent in some soldiers before the storm hit, but was preparing to send in more help once the hurricane passed.
7439	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Flores, who said he was getting radio reports from officials sent in before the storm, said there were no immediate reports of casualties.
7440	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	In the seaside resort of La Ceiba, residents spent the night reinforcing flimsy house walls with plywood and sandbags.
7441	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be strong, but we have faith that Christ will protect us," said 37-year-old housewife Sandra Hernandez, watching satellite images of the storm on television.
7442	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Off Mexico's Pacific coast, meanwhile, Henriette strengthened into a hurricane and was on a path to hit the tip of the Baja California Peninsula on Tuesday afternoon.
7443	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The had sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph).
7444	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) it was centered about 120 kilometers (80 miles) south-southeast of the peninsula.
7445	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Before dawn Tuesday, strong waves pounded the resort's beaches, rain fell in sheets and strong winds whipped palm trees.
7446	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	More than 100 residents spent the night in makeshift shelters as the storm approached, and more were expected to leave their homes Tuesday.
7447	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	On Monday, police in Cabo San Lucas said high surf stirred up by Henriette led to the drowning of an unidentified woman.
7448	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, the storm caused flooding and landslides that killed six people in Acapulco.
7449	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, in the final hours before Hurricane Felix was expected to hit, Grupo Taca Airlines frantically airlifted tourists from the Honduran island of Roatan, popular for its pristine reefs and diving resorts, while the U.S. Southern Command said in a statement that a Chinook helicopter evacuated 19 U.S. citizens, including tourists and members of U.S. Joint Task Force-Bravo who were visiting the island.
7450	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Another 1,000 people were removed from low-lying coastal areas and smaller islands.
7451	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Bob Shearer, 54, from Butler, Pennsylvania, said he was disappointed his family's scuba diving trip to Roatan was cut short by the evacuation order.
7452	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	"I only got seven dives in.
7453	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	I hope they didn't jump the gun too soon," he said as he waited for a flight home in the San Pedro Sula airport.
7454	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Felix was projected to rake central Honduras, slam into Guatemala and then cut across southern Mexico, well south of Texas.
7455	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Its massive storm surge could devastate Indian communities along the Miskito Coast, an isolated region straddling the Honduras- Nicaragua border where Miskito Indians live in wooden shacks, get around on canoes and subsist on fish, beans, rice, cassava and plantains.
7456	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Thousands were stranded along the coast late Monday.
7457	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The only path to safety is up rivers and across lakes that are too shallow for regular boats, but many lack gasoline for long journeys.
7458	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Provincial health official Efrain Burgos estimated that 18,000 people must find their own way to higher ground.
7459	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The storm was following the same path as 1998's Hurricane Mitch, a sluggish storm that stalled for a week over Central America, killing nearly 11,000 people and leaving more than 8,000 missing, mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua.
7460	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Felix could dump up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain in isolated parts of northern Honduras and northeastern Nicaragua, possibly bringing flash floods and mudslides.
7461	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	In the highland capital of Tegucigalpa, more than 160 kilometers (100 miles) inland, authorities cleared vendors from markets prone to flooding.
7462	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Across the border in Belize City, skies grew increasingly cloudy and winds kicked up as residents boarded windows and lined up for gas.

7481	APW_ENG_20070905.0377.LDC2009T13	The battles on Tuesday and Wednesday came after Afghan forces claimed to have killed a Taliban commander involved in the kidnapping of 23 South Korean church workers in central Afghanistan in July.
7482	APW_ENG_20070905.0377.LDC2009T13	Afghan and coalition soldiers in Shah Wali Kot district, in southern Kandahar province, came under attack while on patrol Tuesday.

7499	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister John Howard and Chinese President Hu Jintao announced plans for a yearly security dialogue after a morning of talks.
7500	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	The two also discussed climate change -- the core issue at a weekend summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
7501	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's meeting with Howard comes a day after the Australian leader spent a day hosting U.S. President George W. Bush.
7502	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	While Hu and Howard did not exude the easy rapport that Howard and Bush have, the Australian and Chinese leader had much to celebrate.
7503	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Among agreements signed by their entourages was one for Woodside Petroleum Ltd. to supply liquefied natural gas to state-run PetroChina Co. -- a deal worth up to 35 billion Australian dollars (US$28.8 billion euro21 billion), Howard said.
7504	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	China agreed to donate two pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australia.
7505	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard, in remarks to a conference of business executives, noted that Australia was in its 16th straight year of economic expansion and credited China's explosive emergence as contributing to it.
7506	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"China's growth is undeniably good for the world.
7507	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	It has been undeniably good for Australia," Howard said.
7508	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Taking the podium after him, Hu echoed Howard, saying, "China's sound and steady economic growth has not only benefited China's 1.3 billion people, but also offered enormous business opportunities to other countries."
7509	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's visit was not friction-free.
7510	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu was pressed by reporters on a string of recalls and import bans on Chinese products and foods badly made or tainted with toxic substances.
7511	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On climate change, Howard is seeking a strong endorsement for a new approach to global warming from the leaders at the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
7512	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu, however, only reiterated China's stock position -- that while global warming is a problem, it is largely the fault and responsibility of already industrialized nations.
7513	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	In an indirect slap at Howard's agenda for APEC, Hu said he hoped that the summit's declaration would note that U.N.-sponsored talks "should remain the main channel" for the international efforts to tackle climate change.
7514	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	While the new security talks between Australia and China, which will be convened by foreign ministers next year, marks an upgrade in ties, its announcement comes as Australia also upgrades its security ties with Pacific allies the United States and Japan, who are traditional or potential rivals with China.
7515	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, Bush and Howard announced an agreement to give Australian businesses access to U.S. defense contracts.
7516	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard is due to hold security talks on Saturday with U.S. President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a meeting that Beijing has already criticized as being insufficiently transparent.
7517	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Asked by reporters if the Australia-U.S.-Japan dialogue represented a threat to China, Hu said the countries involved were better able to explain their intentions.
7518	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard said the three-way talks were not directed at China, whose rapid military buildup has been a source of concern in Washington and other regional capitals.
7519	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"The trilateral dialogue between Australia, Japan and the U.S. is not directed at anyone, anymore than the strategic dialogue I have just announced between Australia and China is not directed at anyone," Howard said.
7520	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Officials have not elaborated on the particular security concerns Australia, Japan and the U.S. will address, beyond saying they were issues of common interest.
7521	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	The three governments, which have two-way security agreements between them but no formal three-way arrangement, have worked together on terrorism, the Iraq war and curbing suspected North Korean proliferation of nuclear and other dangerous materials.
7522	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden plans new video in advance of Sept. 11 anniversary
7523	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	first video in 3 years
7524	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2007-09-07 01:21:47 UTC
7525	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
7526	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
7527	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Still, bin Laden's appearance would be significant.
7528	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The al-Qaida leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004, and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his longest period without a message.
7529	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
7530	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black.
7531	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In his past videos, bin Laden's beard was almost entirely gray with dark streaks.
7532	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror messages.
7533	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
7534	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al- Sahab, frequently posts messages.
7535	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al- Sahab.
7536	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Such announcements are usually put out one to three days before the video is posted on the Web.
7537	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours, before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
7538	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
7539	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"They've always gone out of their way to commemorate it," said Ben Venzke, chief executive officer of IntelCenter.
7540	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
7541	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	It's drawn to video releases."
7542	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But the fact that bin Laden is delivering the message is significant, he said.
7543	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
7544	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said he could not confirm the existence of a tape, "and there is no credible information at this time warning of an imminent threat to the homeland."
7545	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
7546	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would only underscore the threat the United States and other nations face from extremists.
7547	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Six years after 9/11, the arrests in Germany and Denmark this week and the battles we fight against al-Qaida in Iraq, Afghanistan, southeast Asia and around the world remind us of the continuing threat we face from extremists and why we must continue to take the fight to them wherever they are," said Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House.
7548	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the U.S. presidential elections.
7549	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
7550	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.
7551	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	His last audiotape was on July 1, 2006, in which he welcomed new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq succeeding the slain Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
7552	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
7553	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	That absence sparked widespread speculation he was ill, wounded or possibly dead.
7554	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	There has been little such speculation since then.
7555	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.
7556	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	He is thought to be hiding in the tribal regions of western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
7557	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	During bin Laden's silence, his deputy Egyptian-born Ayman al- Zawahri has been frequently issuing videos and audiotapes.
7558	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri appeared in a 2006 video marking the 9-11 anniversary.
7559	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	An anniversary video in 2003 showed footage of bin Laden and al- Zawahri walking through mountain paths, with voice-over messages from both leaders.

7567	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	Bobby Charlton has called for a reduction in the number of foreign players in the Premier League in a bid to improve England's national team.
7568	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"We've begun to bring in too many from overseas.
7569	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	It is a big problem," the former Manchester United and England player said Thursday.
7570	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"You can't really expect to be generating good young players coming into the game if you're actually, at the same time, bringing in players that will hinder them getting into the team."
7571	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	England's injury list has caused problems for coach Steve McClaren ahead of must-win European Championship qualifiers against Israel on Saturday and Russia next Wednesday.
7572	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"I think England are really struggling at the moment.
7573	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	They've got injuries and they don't have the luxury of actually going out and picking, as they used to do, somebody from every club," said Charlton, a World Cup champion in 1966.
7574	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"If you look at it, England probably has two decent strikers and if one of them gets injured, as Wayne Rooney is at the moment, we have nobody else."
7575	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	The Premier League has become an attractive -- and lucrative -- destination for foreign players, with the result that homegrown talent has been squeezed out.
7576	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	Englishmen accounted for just 37 percent of players in the opening weekend of the season last month -- a drop from 76 percent in 1992, the Premier League's inaugural season.
7577	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	Charlton, who scored a record 49 times in 106 appearances for England, called for politicians to impose restrictions on foreign players while acknowledging that such measures were harder to do now.
7578	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"It needs some commission or committee to be brought to bear to really have a good look at it because it is a big problem," Charlton said.
7579	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"We're part of the European Union now and you just can't do things that we could do in the past.
7580	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	You could stop people from coming in, if that's what you wanted to do."
7581	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	Charlton, who scored a record 198 times for the Red Devils, said he was pleased fans could watch some English players at Old Trafford.
7582	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"I want, when I get to see the program, to think that there's a little bit of something local," the United director said.
7583	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"I don't want to read that they are all foreign players."
7584	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	Charlton launched his autobiography, "My Manchester United Years," at Old Trafford on Thursday.
7585	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	In the book, the 69-year-old Charlton describes falling in love with soccer by kicking a ball against a wall alone until deep into the night.
7586	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"Young kids who would normally be playing outside on the streets with each other can't do that (today) because there are cars everywhere.
7587	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	They're sidetracked into the house to watch television and to play the computer games," Charlton said.
7588	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"There's no great influx of kids coming into the game.
7589	APW_ENG_20070907.0227.LDC2009T13	"If it's easier to get players from overseas that's what we might have to do and sometimes we've had to do that, but it's not what we want."

7606	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	SYDNEY, Australia 2007-09-07 07:56:51 UTC
7607	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	The leaders of Russia and Australia signed a deal Friday to export Australian uranium to fuel Russian nuclear power plants, and promised the atomic material would not be sold on to Iran.
7608	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian Prime Minister John Howard signed the deal during bilateral talks on the sidelines of a summit of Pacific Rim leaders in Sydney.
7609	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	While the agreement forbids Russia from selling Australian uranium to any other nation or using it for military purposes, critics of the deal worry that it could make it easier for rogue states to obtain the raw material.
7610	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Asked whether Russia could be trusted not to sell Australian uranium to Tehran, Putin said his mineral-rich country already had an "excessive" supply of military-grade uranium that it was reprocessing and selling to U.S. power plants.
7611	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	"If we have a need to sell uranium to other countries, our resources, our own resources, are sufficient," Putin told reporters through a translator.
7612	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	He said Russia planned to build an extra 30 nuclear power plants over the next two decades and needed Australian uranium to complete the expansion.
7613	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Australia has the world's largest reserves of the atomic resource, but has no nuclear power program of its own.
7614	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Exporting uranium for nuclear power remains a touchy issue among many Australians, who are uneasy about its environmental impact and potential for weapons use.
7615	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Critics say the inflow of Australian uranium would allow Russia to divert its own supply of the atomic resource to military or export purposes.
7616	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	"It may very well be the case that what Russia will do will be to use Australian uranium for domestic purposes," Graeme Gill, a Russia expert at the Sydney University told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
7617	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	But "what that does is free up Russian sources of uranium, which they can then ship abroad."
7618	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Howard has rejected criticism of the Russian uranium deal, saying it is a logical progression from Australia's recent agreement to export atomic fuel to China to feed that country's growing energy needs.
7619	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	The prime minister also dismissed concerns about Australian atomic fuel falling into Iran's hands, saying that any uranium sold under the deal would be "subject to very strict safeguards."
7620	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Russia has built Iran's first nuclear power plant and has a significant financial stake in Iran's nuclear power program.
7621	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	In recent months, however, Moscow has played a complicated role in attempts to pressure Tehran to comply with global demands that it suspend its budding nuclear weapons program.

7624	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	ALGIERS, Algeria 2007-09-08 11:56:22 UTC
7625	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	A booby-trapped car exploded at a barracks housing coast guard officials in Algeria on Saturday, killing at least 17 people and injuring about 30, the country's official news agency reported, citing hospital authorities.
7626	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	The explosion -- the North African nation's second terror attack in less than 48 hours -- ripped through the northern coastal town of Dellys, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Algiers, shattering many of the town's windows.
7627	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	In the confusion, security authorities initially gave a lower death toll before the APS agency released an official count by hospitals.
7628	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Some of those injured were in serious condition.
7629	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	A recent spate of major bombings in Algeria has generated fears of a return to the mass-scale violence of the 1990s, when Algeria's Islamic insurgency peaked.
7630	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	The country, a staunch U.S. ally in the war against terror, has been trying to turn the page on the 15-year insurgency that killed 200,000 people.
7631	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Until recently, its efforts appeared mostly successful.
7632	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	The attack came just two days after another bombing killed at least 22 in a crowd of people in eastern Algeria who were waiting to see visiting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has devoted his eight years in office to ending the insurgency.
7633	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	There was widespread speculation that Bouteflika was the intended target of that attack, though Algerian officials kept silent on the question.
7634	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Police said the bomber was killed by security services after he dropped the explosives and tried to escape.
7635	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate claim of responsibility in either attack.
7636	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	However, an al-Qaida affiliate calling itself al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa has been active in Algeria lately.
7637	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni warned terrorists that they have "one choice: turn themselves in, or die."
7638	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Algeria's insurgency broke out in 1992, after the army canceled legislative elections that a now-banned Islamic fundamentalist party was poised to win.
7639	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Widespread killing was on the wane until recently, but violence resurfaced this year after Algeria's Salafist Group for Call and Combat, or GSPC, officially linked with al-Qaida, taking the name al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa.
7640	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	The group claimed responsibility for other attacks this year, including an April suicide bombing outside the prime minister's office in Algiers and a simultaneous attack on a police station that killed 32 people.
7641	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida's Algerian branch also said it was responsible for another attack in July, when a suicide bomber blew up a refrigerated truck inside a military encampment southeast of the Algerian capital, killing 10 soldiers.

7644	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland held Serbia to a scoreless draw Saturday, seriously denting the home team's hopes of qualifying for the European Championships.
7645	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Serbia attacked for most of the match but captain Dejan Stankovic and forward Danko Lazovic missed two clear chances in the first half.
7646	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland's goalkeeper Jussi Jasskelainen also made a diving save to stop midfielder Bosko Jankovic's curling free kick in the 37th minute.
7647	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland concentrated on defending and launching counter attacks.
7648	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	In the 17th minute, forward Jonatan Johansson had a one-on-one situation against Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic, but failed to lob the fall into the net.
7649	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Serbia lost its dominance in the second half, creating only one chance when Lazovic intercepted a poor backward pass in the 48th minute, but Jaaskelainen managed to control his poor shot.
7650	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland has 18 points from 10 matches in Group A, while Serbia has 15 from nine.
7651	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	"Not everything is lost," said Serbia striker Nikola Zigic, who came on as a substitute in the second half.

7658	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	WELLINGTON, New Zealand 2007-09-10 05:53:36 UTC
7659	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The United States returned the tattooed head of a Maori and bones from 13 others to New Zealand on Monday -- the latest repatriation of indigenous remains from overseas museums, a Maori expert said.
7660	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	"The ancestors were welcomed back on to Te Papa's marae (National Museum meeting place)" and placed in a sacred area with scores of other returned remains, said Arapata Hakiwai, director of Maori treasures at Wellington's Te Papa National Museum.
7661	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Representatives of Maori tribes took part in the early morning ceremony, along with staff from Chicago's Field Museum, the donor, and American Indian First Nation tribal members.
7662	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	"For all of us a very emotional time to be returning at last the (remains) to New Zealand," Field Museum Curator of Pacific anthropology John Terrell told The Associated Press.
7663	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The Chicago museum bought the bones in 1893 from a scientific supply house in New York.
7664	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Researchers once used them to compare the features of different native peoples.
7665	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Hakiwai, one of the group that accompanied the remains from the Field Museum, said the museum had "made the right decision on the right grounds -- it was the right thing to do."
7666	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The Field Museum one of the first major U.S. museums to return Maori remains, which will now be part of ongoing research to try to determine which tribal area they originated from in the 19th century.
7667	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	They were collected when Maoris offered mummified heads and other remains of mainly slaves in grisly exchanges for guns and other goods.
7668	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Hakiwai said his museum had acquired repatriated Maori remains from more than 30 institutions worldwide since 2003.
7669	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The museum in Chicago also has a 125-year-old carved Maori meeting house acquired in 1919, and Terrell said museum officials would meet with Maori leaders to discuss how best to help it function as a multicultural meeting place for Chicago.
7670	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Several other U.S. museums still hold Maori heads and bones, including the American Museum of Natural History, which has some 35 severed Maori heads.

7672	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-09-10 09:10:20 UTC
7673	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	Royal Philips Electronics NV, one of Europe's largest electronics makers, said Monday it expects to more than double profitability by 2010 as it reorganizes the company into three main divisions.
7674	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The maker of medical and lighting equipment said in a statement it expects to raise profitability by 7.5 percent and rearrange its units.
7675	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	"Philips plans to simplify its business structure by creating three core sectors with strong single-headed management: Philips Healthcare, Philips Lighting, and Philips Consumer Lifestyle," the company said.
7676	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	Philips, which makes consumer electronics, high-end medical equipment, energy-saving light bulbs and household appliances like shavers, sold its semiconductor division last year.
7677	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The company has been steadily departing markets where it doesn't hold a first or second-place position, notably divesting its mobile phones operations after being eclipsed by Nokia Corp.
7678	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The company also said it aims to deliver a minimum of 6 percent comparable annual average sales growth for the two-year period through 2010.
7679	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	Philips shares gained 2.7 percent to euro29.13 (US$40.12) in Amsterdam.

7681	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	panic prevailed elsewhere
7682	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	BANGKOK, Thailand 2007-09-14 04:00:19 UTC
7683	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	By most accounts, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System passed its first big test, with the massive earthquakes in Indonesia providing the perfect opportunity for drills from Asia to Africa.
7684	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Within minutes of the temblors off Indonesia's western coast on Wednesday -- and yet another on Thursday -- officials sent out warnings by mobile phone SMS, e-mail and fax to coastal communities in the path of potential monster waves.
7685	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Similar warnings reached governments as far away as Bangladesh and Kenya, where coastal residents and tourists were ushered off beaches with megaphones and onto higher ground.
7686	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They were quite fast in delivering the warning.
7687	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The first warning went out in five or six minutes," said Michael Rottmann, the U.N. special coordinator for the early warning system in Indonesia.
7688	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"The president announced the system will be ready in 2008, but this earthquake showed it's working already."
7689	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Officials acknowledged there were glitches, with evacuations in Indonesia marked by fear and panic in some hard-hit neighborhoods.
7690	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Residents on Thailand's six southern provinces rushed to the hills and remained there for two hours -- even though a tsunami alert had yet to be issued.
7691	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The 2004 tsunami hit southern Thailand, including the tourist resort of Phuket, and killed more than 8,000 people.
7692	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People in the southern provinces heard warnings from other centers abroad and were panicking," Smith Dharmasaroja, director of the National Disaster Warning Center, told Thai TV viewers when he broke into regular programming to make an emergency address.
7693	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	For some experts, however, the performance highlighted progress many governments in the region have made since the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster which left 230,000 dead.
7694	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	That disaster was marked by failure to warn many communities about the impending waves, mostly due to faulty equipment, poor communications and cumbersome bureaucracy.
7695	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It prompted the United Nations and six government donors, including the United States, to create a US$130 million (euro97 million) tsunami warning system, which is expected to be fully operational at the end next year.
7696	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Progress was initially slowed by bickering over technical problems with deep-sea monitoring buoys.
7697	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Governments also came under fire for failing to educate citizens about the threat of tsunamis, bolster coastal infrastructure, and establishing ways to pass along warnings to remote villages.
7698	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, Indonesia, which was hit hardest by the 2004 disaster, has installed dozens of tidal gauges and deep-ocean tsunami monitoring buoys to detect waves as well as more than 150 seismometers to detect earthquakes.
7699	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It has vastly improved its communication network, resulting in a quake alert going out within minutes of the actual temblor.
7700	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The quake was detected on a seismograph which relays a message to the country's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency.
7701	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It then sent a warning to hundreds of emergency management personnel in the disaster-hit regions.
7702	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Tsunami alerts managed to reach remote areas including coastal communities in Australia's northwestern territories of Christmas and Cocos Islands, India's Andaman Islands, as well as beachfront communities in Sri Lanka severely damaged by the 2004 tsunami.
7703	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	G.G. Somaratne from Payagala, a southern coastal town in Sri Lanka, said that all his neighbors were panic-stricken when the tsunami warning came.
7704	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"We took all our valuable goods to the second floor of a neighbor, carried whatever we could take and went to a relative's home some seven miles away," said Somaratne, who is still rebuilding his beachside home destroyed in 2004.
7705	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People were in temples and churches, relatives and friends, and returned after the warning was lifted, but some are still scared to come back," he said.
7706	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In Bangladesh, volunteers with bullhorns warned villagers to evacuate to higher or inland areas, while local television and radio stations issued warnings as town halls opened control rooms to monitor the situation.
7707	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In the southern sea resort town of Cox's Bazar, tourists were evacuated to inland hotels while the country's national soccer team -- holding a training camp -- was rushed off to a hilltop guest house.
7708	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Indonesian communities were praised for responding to alerts by rushing to higher ground.
7709	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"I understand that there has been a lot of public awareness in Padang and Bengkulu," said Richard Whelden, deputy mission director for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bangkok.
7710	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People didn't run to the water," after the quakes, he said.
7711	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They got out of their houses and moved away from the water.
7712	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The point is that people responded, which is something that wouldn't have happened two years ago."

7716	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	MEXICO CITY 2007-09-16 02:23:28 UTC
7717	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Bitter political rivalries flared at independence celebrations in Mexico for a second year in a row.
7718	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexico City's central plaza was the scene of competing celebrations on Saturday -- divided by metal fences and thousands of police officers, as the nation continues to struggle with last year's hotly contested presidential election.
7719	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	In keeping with custom, President Felipe Calderon was to mark the start of Independence Day by stepping out on a National Palace balcony at 11:00 p.m. (0400GMT) and crying, "Viva Mexico!"
7720	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexicans gathered below in the Zocalo, or main square, traditionally answer the president's shouts in unison.
7721	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	But this year, in another corner of the plaza, thousands of Calderon's detractors led by Sen. Rosario Ibarra planned their own "grito," or cry of independence.
7722	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	A third celebration was in the works by Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard.
7723	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Ibarra is a political ally of leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who narrowly lost the July 2006 election to the conservative Calderon.
7724	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador claims the election was tainted by fraud and has refused to accept Calderon's victory.
7725	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mayor Ebrard is a member of Lopez Obrador's Democratic Revolution Party.
7726	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Last September -- following two months of protests that snarled a main avenue in the capital to demand a recount -- then-President Vicente Fox avoided a confrontation by moving the ceremony hundreds of miles (kilometers) away to Dolores Hidalgo, where Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo made the first cry for independence from Spain in 1810.
7727	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador said this year he would celebrate with followers in San Jose Tenango in southern Oaxaca state, one of the poorest municipalities in Mexico.
7728	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	In Mexico City, factions staked out their turf in the Zocalo days ahead of time.
7729	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	The president's office set up metal fencing around a section in front of the National Palace, while Lopez Obrador's supporters set up tents on the square's opposite end.
7730	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, hundreds of vendors selling confetti and snacks crowded into the square, which was decorated with red, white and green lights -- the colors of the Mexican flag.
7731	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexicans arriving for the nighttime celebration went through metal detectors and were received by blaring speakers on opposites sides of the plaza competing for their attention -- and making it impossible to hear.
7732	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Calderon said no one should be left out of the Independence Day celebration, calling it an opportunity "for harmony and reconciliation."
7733	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Veronica Franco, who planned to attend Ibarra's event, said she came to protest Calderon's presidency.
7734	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	"We're here to show that the Mexican people are not fools and that we won't allow for another fraud to take place," Franco said.

7736	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia 2007-09-17 14:25:08 UTC
7737	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	Three Slovenian volunteer firefighters have been detained on suspicious of arson in 60 fires since December in a northeastern city, a police chief said Monday.
7738	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	They were detained last week and two of the suspects are 17, Maribor police chief Marjan Fank said.
7739	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	"It seems that their motive primarily was to prove their readiness and skillfulness in putting down the fires," Fank said, according to the state-run news agency STA.
7740	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	The fires included ones at an abandoned psychiatric clinic, a sports field under construction and a warehouse, Fank said.
7741	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	The damages caused are estimated at euro750,000 (US$1 million), he said.

7745	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-09-17 20:05:46 UTC
7746	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The state and city of New York sued Merck &amp
7747	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Co.
7748	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Inc. on Monday, accusing the drugmaker of defrauding the main health benefit program for the poor and other government insurance programs by hiding the risks of heart problems associated with its pain medication Vioxx.
7749	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, said the state's Medicaid and Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage programs have paid more than $100 million (euro72 million) for Vioxx prescriptions since the drug went on sale in 1999.
7750	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	For its residents receiving Medicaid assistance, New York City paid a substantial share of those costs.
7751	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit says tens of millions of dollars (euros) were paid for prescriptions for patients with preexisting heart conditions.
7752	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Those funds would not have been spent had the risks associated with Vioxx been known, court papers say.
7753	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The filing was announced by New York state Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
7754	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, removed Vioxx from the market in Sept. 30, 2004 because it doubled risk of heart attack and stroke.
7755	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Before stopping Vioxx sales, court papers say, Merck "undertook a concerted and tenacious campaign of false and fraudulent statements to minimize the import and seriousness" of the possible association between Vioxx and heart problems.
7756	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	This "disinformation campaign" continued until a month before Merck ceased sales of the drug, causing New York doctors to continue writing prescriptions for Vioxx that they otherwise would not have written, according to the lawsuit.
7757	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck spokesman Kent Jarrell said the company researched and monitored the drug while it was on the market and voluntarily withdrew it when problems were suspected.
7758	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that our behavior has been responsible," Jarrell said, adding that similar lawsuits seeking reimbursement for insurance costs have been filed in "a handful" of other states.
7759	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit asks that Merck be ordered to pay New York City and the state three times their damages, to be determined at trial.
7760	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	It also asks that Merck be required to pay the state a civil penalty of $12,000 (euro8,647) for each false claim, and $15,000 (euro10,809) to the city for each such violation.
7761	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The number of false claims would be determined at trial.
7762	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck faces almost 27,000 lawsuits from people claiming Vioxx caused heart attacks and strokes, but more than 1,170 cases have been dismissed.
7763	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Of cases that have reached verdicts, Merck has won nine and lost five
7764	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	a new trial was ordered in another case.

8009	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-09-24 20:38:23 UTC
8010	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad questioned the official version of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and defended the right to cast doubt on the Holocaust in a tense appearance Monday at Columbia University, whose president accused him of behaving like "a petty and cruel dictator."
8011	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad smiled at first but appeared increasingly agitated, decrying the "insults" and "unfriendly treatment."
8012	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Columbia President Lee Bollinger and audience members criticized him over Iran's human-rights record and foreign policy, as well as Ahmadinejad's statements denying the Holocaust and calling for the disappearance of Israel.
8013	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
8014	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
8015	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"When you come to a place like this it makes you simply ridiculous," Bollinger said.
8016	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
8017	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here."
8018	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully," Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians.
8019	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."
8020	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	During a question-and-answer session, Ahmadinejad appeared tense and unsmiling, in contrast to more relaxed interviews and appearances earlier in the day.
8021	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	In response to one audience, Ahmadinejad denied he was questioning the existence of the Holocaust: "Granted this happened, what does it have to do with the Palestinian people?"
8022	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But then he said he was defending the rights of European scholars, an apparent reference to a small number who have been prosecuted under national laws for denying or minimizing the Holocaust.
8023	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing known as absolute," he said.
8024	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He reiterated his desire to visit ground zero to express sympathy with the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but then appeared to question whether al-Qaida was responsible.
8025	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Why did this happen?
8026	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	What caused it?
8027	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	What conditions led to it?"
8028	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	he said.
8029	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Who truly was involved?
8030	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Who was really involved and put it all together?"
8031	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Asked about executions of homosexuals in Iran, Ahmadinejad said the judiciary system executed violent criminals and high-level drug dealers, comparing them to microbes eliminated through medical treatment.
8032	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Pressed specifically about punishment of homosexuals, he said: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country."
8033	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	With the audience laughing derisively, he continued: "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon.
8034	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	I don't know who's told you that we have this."
8035	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Bollinger was strongly criticized for inviting Ahmadinejad to Columbia, and had promised tough questions in his introduction to Ahmadinejad's talk.
8036	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But the strident and personal nature of his attack on the president of Iran was startling.
8037	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated," Bollinger told Ahmadinejad about the leader's Holocaust denial.
8038	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	During his prepared remarks, the Iranian president did not address Bollinger's accusations directly.
8039	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Ahmadinejad's softer tone on Israel in this speech may reflect backlash in his own country.
8040	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's been widespread commentary in Iran, even on the far- right, that Ahmadinejad's position on Israel has hurt the country's diplomatic relations," said Maloney.
8041	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The fact that he was frankly unwilling to go as far as he has in the past suggests there may have been some consequences for him at home."
8042	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush said Ahmadinejad's appearance at Columbia "speaks volumes about really the greatness of America."
8043	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He told Fox News Channel that if Bollinger considers Ahmadinejad's visit an educational experience for Columbia students, "I guess it's OK with me."
8044	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Other American officials were less sympathetic.
8045	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	On Capitol Hill, conservatives said Columbia should not have invited Ahmadinejad to speak.
8046	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said "there is a world of difference between not preventing Ahmadinejad from speaking and handing a megalomaniac a megaphone and a stage to use it."
8047	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Senator Joseph Lieberman said he thought Columbia's invitation to Ahmadinejad was a mistake "because he comes literally with blood on his hands."
8048	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people jammed two street blocks across from the United Nations to protest Ahmadinejad's visit to New York.
8049	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Organizers claimed a turnout of tens of thousands.
8050	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Police did not immediately have a crowd estimate.
8051	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	The speakers, most of them politicians and officials from Jewish organizations, proclaimed their support for Israel and criticized the Iranian leader for his remarks questioning the Holocaust.
8052	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"We're here today to send a message that there is never a reason to give a hatemonger an open stage," New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said.
8053	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Protesters also assembled at Columbia.
8054	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Dozens stood near the lecture hall where Ahmadinejad was scheduled to speak, linking arms and singing traditional Jewish folk songs about peace and brotherhood, while nearby a two-person band played "You Are My Sunshine."
8055	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Signs in the crowd displayed a range of messages, including one that read "We refuse to choose between Islamic fundamentalism and American imperialism."

8059	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-09-28 08:25:23 UTC
8060	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	A spiritual leader of Israel's religious Zionist movement, Rabbi Avraham Shapira, has died after a long illness in Jerusalem.
8061	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	He was 94.
8062	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Shapira died Thursday after being hospitalized earlier in the week due to deteriorating health.
8063	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Thousands of his followers had prayed for his well-being in recent days at the Western Wall, the holiest Jewish site in Jerusalem's Old City.
8064	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	The rabbi of the movement that forms the backbone of Israel's settlement enterprise was most known in Israel for his call on observant soldiers in 2005 to disobey orders to dismantle 21 Jewish settlements during Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip that year.
8065	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Many Orthodox Jews oppose any withdrawal from the West Bank or Gaza, considering them part of their God-given Promised Land.
8066	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Shapira's call helped foster widespread fervent opposition to the pullout and fears of clashes between settlers, their backers and the security forces.
8067	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	The withdrawal from Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank was completed with no great violence or casualties in September 2005.
8068	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Shapira also opposed the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accords in 1993, saying Jewish law forbade Israel from transferring holy land to the Palestinians.
8069	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Shapira was a chief rabbi in Israel for ten years beginning in 1983.
8070	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	He was a top adjudicator on the Torah and a leader of his movement's Mercaz Harav religious seminary in Jerusalem.
8071	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	He was to be buried in Jerusalem later Friday.

8073	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	MELBOURNE, Australia 2007-09-29 08:08:35 UTC
8074	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Minor premiers Geelong broke a 44-year title drought and a run of five fruitless finals appearances when it beat Port Adelaide 24.19 (163), 6.8 (44) in the Australian Rules Football League Grand Final on Saturday.
8075	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Geelong Cats topped regular season standings by 12 points with a 19-win, one-loss record to secure the minor premiership, and confirmed their rating as the best team in the AFL with Saturday's historic win over the 2004 champions.
8076	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"We were the best side all year and we thoroughly deserve this," Geelong midfielder Joel Corey said.
8077	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong became the first team from the state of Victoria since Essendon in 2000 to win the AFL title when they eased to victory in front of a crowd of 98,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
8078	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Coach Mark Thompson became the seventh man in AFL history to have both captained and coached a team to premiership victory.
8079	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	He had previous captained Essendon to the championship in 1993.
8080	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's 119-point win was the largest in grand final history, dwarfing Hawthorn's 96-point win over Melbourne in 1998.
8081	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Cats dominated the match, outscoring Port Adelaide 5.7 to 2.2 in the first quarter, before kicking five goals in the first 12 minutes of the second quarter to build a 52-point lead.
8082	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong were on top in every aspect of the contest, with their defense -- which has been the best in the competition all season -- keeping Port Adelaide to their lowest score of the year.
8083	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"We just want to thank the fans for their patience," Thompson said.
8084	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"It's been a long time coming but it's worth the wait."
8085	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's Steve Johnson was named Man of the Match.
8086	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Johnson began the season suspended for off-field behaviour and ended up an All- Australian and premiership player.
8087	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Johnson kicked four goals from half-forward.

8090	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Unofficial results showed Pakistan's Gen. Pervez Musharraf sweeping Saturday's presidential election, but the Supreme Court could still disqualify the military leader.
8091	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Chief Election Commissioner Qazi Muhammad Farooq announced that Musharraf had won 252 of the 257 votes cast in Parliament, with three ballots judged invalid and two votes going to his main rival, retired judge Wajihuddin Ahmad.
8092	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Pakistan Television reported unofficial results that Musharraf had also swept the voting in three of Pakistan's four provinces.
8093	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Vote counting had yet to start in the fourth province of Sindh.
8094	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the official results can only be declared after it rules on petitions lodged by Musharraf's opponents that his candidacy is unconstitutional.

8096	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	TBILISI, Georgia 2007-10-09 10:57:04 UTC
8097	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgia's former defense minister was freed on a multimillion- dollar bail early Tuesday after retracting his accusations against the president and left the country, news reports said.
8098	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Irakly Okruashvili was arrested Sept. 27, the day after he accused President Mikhail Saakashvili of a murder plot and corruption -- allegations Saakashvili dismissed as "unpardonable lies."
8099	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was charged with extortion, money-laundering and abuse of power.
8100	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Nika Gvaramia, Georgia's deputy chief prosecutor, said Okruashvili had retracted his accusations and admitted he made them for political purposes.
8101	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Gvaramia also said that Okruashvili had pleaded guilty to charges of extortion and failure to properly perform his duties.
8102	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgian television stations on Monday broadcast footage of the questioning in which Okruashvili retracted his accusations.
8103	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili, wearing a track suit, looked tense and tired but spoke clearly.
8104	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	A court in the capital, Tbilisi, ruled Monday to free Okruashvili on bail equivalent to US$6 million (euro4.3 million).
8105	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was freed overnight after he produced the money and was escorted home by police.
8106	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	He refused to answer reporters' questions.
8107	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Later Tuesday, the Georgian Pirveli news agency quoted Okruashvili's bodyguards as saying he had left the country with his family.
8108	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Keti Chomakhishvili who was in charge of Okruashvili's case couldn't confirm that he went abroad, but said it could be part of an arrangement with authorities.
8109	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was a longtime Saakashvili ally who served as his defense minister until late last year.
8110	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	His accusations and arrest have thrown the ex-Soviet nation into its worst political turmoil since Saakashvili was propelled to power in the 2003 uprising known as the Rose Revolution.
8111	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Opposition leaders said Monday that Okruashvili had been forced into making his statement and promised to go ahead with protests demanding Saakashvili's ouster.

8280	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 2007-10-17 18:11:37 UTC
8281	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The St. Petersburg legislature approved Wednesday the construction of a skyscraper that will tower near the architectural treasures of Russia's Imperial-era capital, a project that has drawn protests from many residents.
8282	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The city assembly adopted legislation providing for the construction of a mixed-use complex anchored by a glass-encased tower that is to rise 320 meters (1,050 feet), more than twice as high as the stately city's current tallest building.
8283	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The Okhta project, pushed by the state-controlled natural gas monopoly OAO Gazprom, has sparked heated debate.
8284	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	And anger over the plans was a major draw during a handful of protests held by Russia's struggling political opposition in St. Petersburg over the past year.
8285	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Critics say the building would be a massively discordant element on the mostly low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg.
8286	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	They cite rules dating back centuries that have limited the height of buildings in the center of city founded by Czar Peter the Great more than 300 years ago.
8287	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Proponents argue that the site is not in the historical center.
8288	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The law approved by the predominantly pro-Kremlin city legislature sought to appease opponents by decreasing the amount the city will pay to about 25 billion rubles (US$1 billion
8289	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro700 million) instead of the entire projected construction cost of 60 billion rubles (US$2.4 billion
8290	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro1.7 billion), as previously planned.
8291	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Gazprom's oil subsidiary, OAO Gazpromneft, will pay most of the rest, officials said.
8292	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Mikhail Amosov, a former head of the assembly's architecture and planning committee and a leader of opposition to the project, said the change in the financing scheme was good news but the city should not be paying anything.
8293	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	He expressed hope that lawmakers would bring the height of the tower to 100 meters (328 feet) or less.
8294	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	But Vatanyar Yagya, a legislator from the dominant United Russia party, said the law was final and the architectural plans would not be altered.
8295	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	"Okhta ... will be located not in the city's historical center but at least 500 meters (550 yards) from it," Yagya said.
8296	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	"When people refer to the czar's height rules, it's about the past ... In such big cities as Moscow and St. Petersburg there can be only two lines in construction decisions -- high up or deep down."
8297	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The complex is to be built by 2016.

8301	APW_ENG_20071019.0369.LDC2009T13	A cooking gas tank exploded in a restaurant near a shopping mall in Manila's financial district Friday, killing at least three people and injuring several others, police said.
8302	APW_ENG_20071019.0369.LDC2009T13	The lunchtime blast rocked the restaurant in Makati, near the busy Glorietta shopping complex, said metropolitan Manila police chief Geary Barias.
8303	APW_ENG_20071019.0369.LDC2009T13	At least three people were killed and 10 others injured, Barias told Radio Mindanao Network.
8304	APW_ENG_20071019.0369.LDC2009T13	Witnesses told radio stations they saw bloodied people being helped out of the restaurant and carried away in ambulances.

8306	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Top investigator says up to 6 Nigerian ex-governors to be charged
8307	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	ABUJA, Nigeria 2007-10-23 15:55:59 UTC
8308	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nigeria's top corruption investigator said Tuesday that up to six ex-governors will be charged by the end of the year, a major development in a country where having high-level connections has long offered a shield from prosecution.
8309	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nuhu Ribadu, chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, refused to identify the men, saying he is afraid "they will run."
8310	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	But, he said, up to six will face charges in the next two months.
8311	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Definitely more governors will be charged," Ribadu told The Associated Press in an interview at his office in the Nigerian capital.
8312	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Governors are so afraid, wherever they go now."
8313	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	The governors of Nigeria's 36 states lose their immunity from prosecution when their terms end.
8314	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Many have been suspected of raiding public coffers -- and leaving their constituents impoverished -- while they hide their ill-gotten gains outside the country.
8315	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Under Nigeria's federal system, states receive much of the government's funds and are charged with providing schools, health clinics and other basic services to their people.
8316	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	State budgets can reach beyond US$1 billion per year, particularly in the southern oil region, where budgets are even higher and graft particularly rife.
8317	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Since President Umaru Yar'Adua took power in May, the EFCC has begun prosecuting five former governors and has won the conviction of one who had been previously charged.
8318	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	The crackdown is a signal to many in Nigeria that Yar'Adua is trying to make good on his pledge to stamp out graft in a country that is considered one of the most corrupt in the world.
8319	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"For us to win this war (against corruption), we have to start at the top and trickle down," said Ribadu, a former police officer and prosecutor who boasts that he sent more people to jail than anyone else in Nigeria.
8320	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Elites are the ones who destroy the rule of law," he added.
8321	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Ribadu's agency was set up in 2004 as part of an anti-corruption drive by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo.
8322	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nigeria is Africa's largest oil exporter and the fifth-largest supplier of crude to the United States.
8323	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	But despite producing tens of billions of dollars' (euros') worth of crude every year, few Nigerians have access to clean water or electricity.
8324	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Ribadu said he senses an increased intolerance for corruption in Nigeria, pointing to the public outcry over the case of the speaker of the House of Representatives.
8325	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Patricia Etteh, a former beautician and ruling party member, is accused of irregularities in spending US$5 million of government money to renovate two official residences and buy 12 cars.
8326	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Nigerian members of Parliament traded blows -- and one of them later died of a heart attack -- during a debate over the allegations.
8327	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Etteh has denied wrongdoing, but at a previous appearance before the National Assembly she was greeted with chants of "Thief!
8328	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Thief!"
8329	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"There is a silent revolution triggered by this fight against corruption," Ribadu said.
8330	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Former New York city police commissioner ' s case could hurt Giuliani ' s final push for US votes
8331	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-10-25 20:23:22 UTC
8332	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	The criminal investigation of New York's former police commissioner is on track to crash headlong into the Republican presidential race -- and Rudy Giuliani's final push for the nomination.
8333	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Since former Mayor Giuliani began campaigning, he has sought to distance himself from Bernard Kerik and to blunt the political fallout from his relationship with his ex-police commissioner, business partner and close friend.
8334	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani has accepted responsibility for his role in Kerik's embarrassing 2004 withdrawal as President Bush's Homeland Security nominee amid tax problems.
8335	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Ethics questions and corruption allegations also have swirled around Kerik.
8336	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president," Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly vetted his associate of nearly two decades.
8337	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Such acknowledgments may not be enough for Giuliani to emerge politically unscathed as prosecutors wrap up their investigation of Kerik on multiple federal felony charges.
8338	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Kerik is expected to confront the results of the investigation as early as next month -- and it is widely believed he will either be indicted or reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.
8339	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should prosecutors charge Kerik and the case reach trial, Giuliani could end up being called to testify during the general election campaign.
8340	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should Kerik agree to a plea deal, he could be admitting guilt on some level for activities that may have taken place while the city employed him -- and on Giuliani's watch.
8341	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	At the very least, the case will be in the headlines again, especially if soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Michael Mukasey, another Giuliani friend, recuses himself from any Justice Department prosecution of Kerik.
8342	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani aides play down any political implications, but they acknowledge that Kerik's woes could be a distraction during a period in which they want their candidate promoting his vision for the United States.
8343	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"It will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up," said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political science professor.
8344	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"And, they very well might, especially if he's the front-runner."
8345	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	If Giuliani wins the nomination, Shapiro said, "the Democrats will make this an issue.
8346	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	You can count on that."
8347	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	So far, Kerik's troubles have not seemed to nick Giuliani's primary campaign narrative that he is a Republican who tamed a Democratic city and heroically led New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
8348	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani leads other Republicans in national polls and is competing strongly in early presidential preference voting states.
8349	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Rivals have stepped up criticism of him lately, and Kerik's case would give them more fodder.
8350	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Opponents Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John McCain or Mike Huckabee could use Kerik to try to define Giuliani as somebody who lacks good judgment and surrounds himself with unsavory people.
8351	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"This speaks to issues of ethics and corruption.
8352	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	It speaks to capability and leadership," Shapiro said.
8353	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"Giuliani plays up his leadership as New York City mayor, and Kerik was a part of that."

8355	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-10-26 07:09:54 UTC
8356	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	German train drivers ended a 30-hour strike Friday morning against commuter and regional services across the country but did not get closer to an end of the conflict with the national rail operator.
8357	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	The GDL union's strike, which started Thursday at 2 a.m. (0000GMT) and ended Friday at 8 a.m. (0600GMT), was the third such walkout -- the longest one yet -- in a pay dispute with railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG.
8358	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	GDL wants better working conditions and a significant pay rise for train drivers.
8359	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	More than 2,000 train drivers walked off their jobs, according to GDL, and only one out of every two trains ran in western Germany on Friday morning.
8360	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	The east was even worse-hit with only 10 percent of all regional trains running.
8361	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the union said the motivation among the striking train drivers was still very strong and that GDL would announce at a news conference later Friday further plans regarding strikes next week.
8362	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	"The willingness to strike is high and unbroken," Maik Brandenburger said.
8363	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	GDL hopes to pressure Deutsche Bahn into giving in to its demands of a cut in the working week by one hour to 40 hours and a pay increase of up to 31 percent for its members.
8364	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	It has rejected a 4.5 percent raise that Deutsche Bahn agreed to in talks with two other unions that represent railway workers.
8365	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bahn carries some 5 million passengers daily.

8373	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	BANGKOK, Thailand 2007-10-30 16:47:36 UTC
8374	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Thai police arrested a British man Tuesday and charged him with distributing hundreds of pornographic photographs of children on the Internet, police said.
8375	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Paul Cornelius Jones, 39, who has lived in Thailand for seven years, was arrested after police raided his Bangkok apartment and found a computer containing photos of naked boys and girls, said police Col. Apichart Suribunya, head of Thailand's liaison office for Interpol, the international police agency.
8376	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Thai police acted on a tip-off from their British counterparts, who told them Jones had been sending photos of naked children to Britain over the Internet, Apichart said.
8377	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Police said Jones has been working as a teacher at a Bangkok private school.
8378	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Jones, of Cardiff, Wales, has been charged with distributing pornographic photographs of children under age 15, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Apichart said.
8379	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Another officer in the Thai Interpol office, Maj. Phongphon Iamwicharn, said that Jones did not appear in the photos, and that there was evidence he had sold the pictures.
8380	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Thai police arrested Christopher Paul Neil of Canada on Oct. 19 on charges of having sex with several young Asian boys after Interpol issued an unprecedented worldwide appeal to identify and apprehend him.
8381	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Interpol began its manhunt after finding about 200 pictures on the Internet of Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese boys being sexually abused by a man whose face was digitally obscured.
8382	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	After German police computer experts unscrambled the photos so the man's face was recognizable, Interpol circulated them publicly.
8383	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Tip-offs led them to identify Neil as a suspect.
8384	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	He has been charged with child sexual abuse, but police are still investigating the case.
8385	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Neil has also worked as a teacher at schools in Thailand, South Korea and Vietnam.
8386	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Jones and Neil are both in Thai police custody.
8387	APW_ENG_20071030.1020.LDC2009T13	Several Southeast Asian countries are popular among pedophiles and sex abusers because of poverty that drives children and their parents to accept money for sexual favors, and sometimes because of lax law enforcement.

8390	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	ZURICH, Switzerland 2007-11-01 18:57:32 UTC
8391	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Martina Hingis said Thursday she has been accused of testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon, and then announced her retirement from professional tennis.
8392	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
8393	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous that I've decided to confront it head on by talking to the press," she said.
8394	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I am frustrated and angry.
8395	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I believe that I am absolutely 100 percent innocent."
8396	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Her voice broke as she fought back tears in reading the statement.
8397	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	At the end, she took no questions and left the news conference.
8398	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The 27-year-old Swiss player lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Laura Granville, 6-4, 6-2.
8399	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said the positive test, which could lead to a doping suspension of up to two years, led to her retirement because she doesn't want to spend years fighting the case.
8400	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
8401	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis returned to the sport two years ago after a four-year absence because of injuries.
8402	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She won three straight Australian Open titles from 1997-99, and Wimbledon and the U.S. Open championships in 1997.
8403	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She came within one match of winning the Grand Slam in 1997, losing only in the French Open final.
8404	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	On March 31, 1997, Hingis became the youngest female player ever to lead the world rankings.
8405	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She was 16 years, 6 months and 1 day at the time.
8406	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She is currently ranked No. 19.
8407	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, who lost in the third round of the U.S. Open, hasn't played since her second-round loss to Peng Shuai of China, 7-5, 6-1, in Beijing on Sept. 19.
8408	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Former top-ranked player Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek had positive tests for cocaine at the 1995 French Open.
8409	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Both were banned for three months and ordered to return prize money and forfeit rankings points.
8410	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Others have tested positive for a variety of banned substances.
8411	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she was accused by "an outsource testing company" of taking cocaine during Wimbledon.
8412	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She said she was "shocked and appalled" when notified that her urine sample came back positive after the loss to Granville.
8413	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.
8414	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.
8415	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I only know that if I were to try to hit the ball while in any state of euphoria, it simply wouldn't work.
8416	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I would think that it would be impossible for anyone to maintain the coordination required to play top class tennis while under the influence of drugs.
8417	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	And I know one other thing -- I would personally be terrified of taking drugs."
8418	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she later underwent a privately arranged hair test which came back negative for cocaine.
8419	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The official backup "B" sample test on her Wimbledon urine sample, however, tested positive for the drug.
8420	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample taken during Wimbledon.
8421	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.
8422	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said it could take years to fight her case.
8423	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials," she said.
8424	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me, physically, to keep playing at the top of the game.
8425	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"And frankly, accusations such as these don't exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so."
8426	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Widmer said the test was on June 29 but that Hingis heard about the positive result in mid-September and the positive 'B' sample two or three weeks later.
8427	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She has great angst over this," Widmer said.
8428	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She is heartbroken.
8429	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	... It's crazy.
8430	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	It's very complicated and complex."
8431	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	WTA Tour chief executive Larry Scott said the tour had not received any official information about a positive test and "as a result we are not in a position to comment on the matter."
8432	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"However, it is important to remember that in the area of anti- doping, all players are presumed innocent until proven otherwise," Scott said.
8433	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Referring to her retirement, he said, "Martina Hingis is a tremendous champion and a fan favorite the world over.
8434	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	In her most recent comeback, she proved again that she can perform at the very highest levels of the game."
8435	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The national association Swiss Tennis issued a statement praising Hingis.
8436	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"With Martina a great player is retiring, who was always an example and a figurehead for tennis in Switzerland," association president Rene Stammbach said in the statement.
8437	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"We deeply regret that Martina Hingis ended her outstanding career under the circumstances of such accusations."

8439	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	YANGON, Myanmar 2007-11-04 05:18:46 UTC
8440	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari was in Myanmar's bunker-like new capital Sunday hoping to nudge the country's ruling generals into reconciliation talks with their pro-democracy opponents.
8441	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari arrived Saturday for his second visit since the junta violently suppressed anti-government demonstrations in September.
8442	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The day before his arrival in Yangon, the isolated Southeast Asian nation's largest city, the junta announced it planned to expel the top U.N. diplomat in the country, adding an extra hurdle to the envoy's already difficult mission.
8443	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	After a brief stopover in Yangon, Gambari flew to Naypyitaw to meet with senior leaders, Myanmar government officials said, requesting anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to the media.
8444	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	It was not known which leaders would meet him in Naypyitaw, 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of Yangon, where the generals have established a new capital in a remote area nestled in mountain jungles, or whether he would later be allowed to visit detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon.
8445	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Expected to be high on Gambari's agenda is the junta's accusation that U.N. resident coordinator Charles Petrie went beyond his duties by criticizing the generals' failure to meet the economic and humanitarian needs of its people, and by saying this was the cause of September's mass pro-democracy protests.
8446	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The military has said 10 people were killed in the crackdown, but diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is much higher.
8447	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people were detained.
8448	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta gave foreign diplomats and U.N. representatives a note saying the government did not intend to continue Petrie's assignment in the country.
8449	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.N. said in a statement that Gambari met with Petrie after his arrival and would "stay in Myanmar as long as necessary to accomplish his mission."
8450	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari carried a message of support for Petrie from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as well as one to junta head Senior Gen. Than Shwe, it said.
8451	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari was earlier dispatched to Myanmar after the government crackdown, meeting with Than Shwe as well as twice with Suu Kyi.
8452	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	But little of substance has changed on Myanmar's political scene since, and analysts expect that little will result from Gambari's current visit.
8453	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	"It's a game.
8454	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	It's the only game in town, but it's a game," said David Steinberg, a Myanmar expert from Georgetown University who visited the country last month and met with ministerial-level officials.
8455	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The United Nations has attempted to bring about reconciliation for almost two decades.
8456	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta has from time to time made minor concessions, such as brief meetings with Suu Kyi, but continues to perpetuate its 45-year stranglehold on power -- and sometimes snub its nose at the international community.
8457	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Protest leaders who recently escaped to Thailand say some still look on the United Nations with hope, but others are deeply disillusioned that it has failed to be more forceful in dealing with the generals.
8458	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	"The world seems to have accepted the lies of the (junta).
8459	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	This is a matter of life or death but so far the U.N. and the world have only come up with words," said Kar Kar Pancha, a Yangon businessman who fled to the Thai border.
8460	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.N. secretary-general, who met Gambari on Friday morning in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss his Myanmar trip, was "disappointed" at the government's note, and expressed "full confidence in the United Nations country team and its leadership," U.N. spokeswoman Michele Montas said at U.N. headquarters in New York.
8461	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	She said the U.N. envoy will convey to Myanmar's rulers the secretary-general's "very strong" support for the U.N. leadership in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
8462	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari has been on a six-nation Asian tour urging support from key countries for national reconciliation, a stepped-up transition to democracy, and the release of all detained demonstrators.
8463	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.S. and other Western countries shun the junta for its poor human rights record and failure to hand over power to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi's party after it won national elections in 1990.

8467	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Stocks fell sharply in early trading Friday after Wachovia Corp. said it expects to increase quarterly loan losses, raising investor concern about the continuing credit crisis.
8468	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that credit market volatility could cause a $1.1 billion (euro0.75 billion) writedown for October alone.
8469	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The problem stems from its asset-backed securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, that have lost value on sinking investor demand.
8470	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Investors also were rattled on speculation that Barclays PLC was about to announce a $10 billion (euro6.81 billion) writedown.
8471	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Though the British bank denied the rumors, it demonstrated that Wall Street continues to worry that the summer's credit turmoil shows no signs of abating.
8472	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The market was also still on edge after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Thursday that policy makers expect the U.S. economy to "slow noticeably" this quarter.
8473	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	His comments caused major indexes to fall -- contributing to a slide this week on concerns about continuing credit woes, a weakening dollar and rising oil prices.

8543	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO 2007-11-13 22:19:16 UTC
8544	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday suspended all fishing in areas affected by last week's San Francisco Bay oil spill, calling what was the area's worst spill in nearly two decades an "unbelievable human failure" and promising an investigation.
8545	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
8546	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State Association of Counties annual meeting.
8547	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Then on top of it, it takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
8548	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
8549	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
8550	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A Coast Guard places a skimming vessel at the scene within 80 minutes.
8551	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
8552	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
8553	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Believe me, we will ask the tough questions that need to be asked."
8554	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Coast Guard officials defended their response as "by the book," but concede mistakes in their communication with the public.
8555	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
8556	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000 gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
8557	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Schwarzenegger signed an executive order that will suspend commercial and sport fishing until Dec. 1, or until state health officials decide it is safe.
8558	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Governor's spokesman Jeff Macedo said the state Department of Fish and Game will determine which fishing areas will be affected by the order.
8559	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
8560	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
8561	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas will be closed to fishing.
8562	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood caught in areas impacted by the spill.
8563	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
8564	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
8565	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Rear Adm. Craig Bone, the top Coast Guard officer in California, said Monday that the owners and operators of the ship will unquestionably face civil penalties, and that criminal counts were a possibility.
8566	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
8567	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.
8568	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on problems involving management and communication between the officers on the ship's bridge at the time.
8569	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
8570	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Darrell Wilson, a representative for Regal Stone, said the company was eager to hear the results of the investigation.
8571	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.

8575	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	One of Amsterdam's best-known sex clubs has become the latest victim of the city's crackdown on organized crime infiltration of the city's world famous sex industry.
8576	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The Yab Yum club, located in a historic canalside mansion in downtown Amsterdam, has long been an exclusive hang out for well- heeled businessmen and tourists, but city fathers now believe its owners could be engaging in "criminal transactions" and have revoked its permit, Amsterdam Municipality spokesman Hendrik Wooldrik said Friday.
8577	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Amsterdam has been conducting a crackdown on criminality in the city center for nearly five years, using a 2002 law that forces business operators to disclose detailed accounting in order to have their licenses renewed.
8578	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal activities.
8579	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The owners were allowed to respond to the conclusion, but could not convince the city not to withdraw its license, the municipality said in a statement.
8580	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Wooldrik would not elaborate on what kind of criminal activities were suspected, but so-called private clubs and brothels have in the past been accused of laundering money for crime gangs involved in everything from drug dealing to extortion rackets.
8581	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The club's owners have been ordered to close it down within weeks, but can appeal the decision to pull its license, Wooldrik said.
8582	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Nobody answered the phone at Yab Yum on Friday.
8583	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Entry to the club costs euro70 (US$100), according to its Web site, which shows pictures of an ornate bar and private rooms featuring double beds and huge bath tubs.
8584	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, but Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen says he wants to root out the "underlying criminality" linked to the city's famed Red Light District.
8585	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	In September, the city announced that a public housing corporation had bought 18 buildings in the Red Light District to redevelop them -- a deal that could lead up to the shuttering of one third of the windows where scantily clad prostitutes stand to attract customers.

8599	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	WARSAW, Poland 2007-11-20 11:26:33 UTC
8600	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	A Polish court issued a European arrest warrant Tuesday for Helena Wolinska, a Stalinist-era prosecutor now living in Britain who is accused of fabricating evidence against suspects in the notorious show trials of the 1950s.
8601	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Wolinska, 88, who has lived in England since 1972 and is a British citizen, is accused of masterminding the wrongful arrest and execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II-era Polish hero, and of the wrongful arrest of 24 others.
8602	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
8603	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground Home Army, which rose up against the Nazi occupiers during World War II.
8604	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	After the war, he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new communist regime.
8605	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	A regional military court in Warsaw said that it had issued a European Arrest Warrant for Wolinska -- an EU warrant meant to speed up extraditions within the bloc.
8606	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	However, it wasn't immediately clear if Britain would follow through.
8607	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Britain's Home Office refused a previous extradition request for Wolinska from Poland in 2006, arguing that the alleged wrongdoing had taken place too long ago.

8609	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	CARACAS, Venezuela 2007-11-20 18:41:19 UTC
8610	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The lines formed at dawn and remained long throughout the day -- hundreds upon hundreds of Venezuelans queuing up to buy scarce milk, chicken and sugar at state-run outdoor markets staffed by soldiers in fatigues.
8611	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	President Hugo Chavez's government is trying to cope with scattered shortages of some foods, and long lines at state-run "Megamercal" street markets over the weekend show many Venezuelans are willing to wait for hours to snap up a handful of products they seldom find in supermarkets.
8612	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"You have to get in line and you have to be lucky," said Maria Fernandez, a 64-year-old housewife who was buying milk and chicken on Sunday.
8613	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She said trying to find milk is a constant frustration.
8614	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with the last can.
8615	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The long lines for basic foods at subsidized prices are paradoxical for an oil-rich nation that in many ways is a land of plenty.
8616	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Shopping malls are bustling, new car sales are booming and privately owned supermarkets are stocked with American potato chips, French wines and Swiss Gruyere cheese.
8617	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Yet other foods covered by price controls -- eggs, fresh chicken -- periodically are hard to find in supermarkets.
8618	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Fresh milk has become a luxury, and even baby formula is scarcer nowadays.
8619	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for re-election indefinitely.
8620	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Some government officials accuse producers of holding basic goods off the market to profiteer or to sow discontent among Venezuela's poor, Chavez's core supporters.
8621	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
8622	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The government's price controls are also "totally divorced" from reality -- in some cases below production costs -- making it unprofitable for suppliers to sell their products at official prices, said economist Pedro Palma of the Caracas consulting firm MetroEconomica.
8623	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	More investment is needed in agriculture but the government's agrarian reform effort -- assuming control of vast farmlands and offering them to poor farmers -- has made traditional producers reluctant to invest, he said.
8624	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	And importers also face hurdles.
8625	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Currency exchange controls imposed in 2003 by the government require state approval to obtain dollars at the official rate.
8626	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Those without approval regularly turn to the black market, buying dollars for about three times the fixed rate.
8627	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	To compound the problems, Palma said, some of the products Venezuela looks to import, such as milk and sugar, are scarce internationally.
8628	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Many of those in line at the Megamercal said they are grateful to Chavez for subsidized markets offering prices far cheaper than commercial supermarkets.
8629	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	But they also complained of struggling to find milk, chicken, sugar and cooking oil elsewhere at prices set by the government.
8630	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"I arrived at 6 in the morning to get in line," said Doris Bastida, 32, a mother of four who wheeled an infant son in a stroller.
8631	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had been waiting for about four hours by the time she reached the entrance.
8632	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"What am I going to do?
8633	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	I don't have anywhere else to go," she said.
8634	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Powdered milk is sold by black-market street vendors at US$10 (euro6.80) or more per kilogram (US$4.50/euro3 or more per pound) -- about twice the regulated price and four times the price offered by the state markets.
8635	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Bastida said she still believes in Chavez and plans to vote in favor of his reforms "so that things will get better."
8636	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Plus, she said, if "everyone votes 'no,' they're going to take the Megamercal away from us."
8637	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run again in 2012.
8638	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"We have to vote 'no,'" said 50-year-old Fatima Rodriguez.
8639	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"Do you think it's good to be here waiting in line?"
8640	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Chavez says he is aiming to boost agriculture with projects including state-supported sugar harvesting and a milk processing plant started with help from Iran.
8641	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	For now, Venezuela still imports most of its food, and imports overall have more than doubled in the past three years.
8642	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Chavez's food minister, Gen. Rafael Oropeza, said the open-air markets were fully stocked across the country over the weekend.
8643	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He said leg of pork -- a popular holiday dish -- was imported because local suppliers declined to participate.
8644	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"I'm putting out a call to businesses for them to raise production and respond to the demand," Oropeza said, according to the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional.
8645	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He suggested there were political motives behind the shortages.
8646	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"That's the objective, that the people reach the point of desperation," Oropeza said.
8647	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The Venezuelan Food Industry Chamber denied its members are to blame, saying they are working to satisfy rapidly growing consumer demand.
8648	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Oropeza said the government sold a record 5,948 metric tons (6,557 tons) at its weekend markets nationwide.
8649	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	At one state market in Caracas, the line snaked around a block, while soldiers manned barricades at the entrance.
8650	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	A banner hung above read "Continue on with Chavez."
8651	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Red campaign signs plastered on walls urged: "Yes, with Chavez."
8652	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Factory worker Eugenio Ruiz praised Chavez for the subsidized food and said he plans to vote "yes" so that Chavez can run again.
8653	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"Look at all he's done for us," Ruiz said, explaining he thinks the situation would be worse without Chavez.
8654	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"We have to stay with him, not abandon him."

8656	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	SEOUL, South Korea 2007-11-22 04:50:14 UTC
8657	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	North and South Korea agreed Thursday to run a cargo train service every day on a reconnected track across their heavily armed border starting next month, the Unification Ministry said.
8658	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	The agreement was a follow-up to a deal reached last week at the first prime ministers' talks between the two sides in 15 years, which calls for starting regular cross-border freight train service on Dec. 11.
8659	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	Working-level officials met this week to specify details, including how often trains will run on the short track linking the South to the North's border city of Kaesong, home to an industrial zone for dozens of South Korean factories.
8660	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	A South Korean train will make a round trip every day to the North on the 25-kilometer-long (16-mile-long) rail, transporting cargo to and from the factory park, the ministry said in a statement.
8661	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	It would be the first regular train service between the two sides, which were divided more than half a century ago.
8662	APW_ENG_20071122.0229.LDC2009T13	South Korea hopes the inter-Korean railway will ultimately be linked to Russia's Trans-Siberian railroad and allow an overland route connecting the peninsula to Europe -- significantly cutting delivery times for freight that now requires sea transport.

8671	APW_ENG_20071122.0768.LDC2009T13	While the thin holiday trade could invite sudden, sharp moves, traders expected the market to be largely subdued for the rest of the day.
8672	APW_ENG_20071122.0768.LDC2009T13	The euro, the pound and other currencies have been climbing steadily against the dollar since August amid fears for the health of the U.S. economy, stoked by the subprime credit crisis.

8677	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	China's rise as a global trading power obligates it to drop barriers preventing foreign competition in its domestic market and contributing to its ballooning trade surplus, the European Union's top trade official said Wednesday.
8678	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in Beijing.
8679	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year.
8680	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The weakness of China's currency, the yuan, against the euro also makes exports to China more expensive.
8681	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This is not because of any lack of competitiveness by Europe," Mandelson said.
8682	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"The EU has a surplus with the rest of the world where we are allowed to compete freely."
8683	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The commissioner's remarks, while pointed and critical, did not contain any new proposals or mention any possible EU sanctions.
8684	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes it is necessary to deliver difficult messages on trade ... but they are always constructive," he said.
8685	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright piracy.
8686	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who spoke after Mandelson, tried to address some of those points, saying Beijing has put in measures to expand imports and stimulate domestic demand.
8687	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	He also said China was "sincere and ambitious" in its efforts in protecting intellectual property rights and was giving market forces more determination over the value of the yuan.
8688	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"In China's open market, every trading partner is treated equally," he said, adding that Beijing doesn't seek to have a trade surplus with its partners.
8689	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue in March, officials said.
8690	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Also in Beijing on Wednesday, the EU's top finance officials warned that the weak yuan and looming Chinese trade surplus threatened to spark a backlash in Europe.
8691	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It could have the result that a protectionist reaction could occur in Europe," said Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister.
8692	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia traveled to China for talks with Wen and other officials.
8693	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Discussions covered currency markets and other economic issues, although neither side indicated any breakthroughs.
8694	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, speaking as head of a committee of eurozone finance ministers known as the Eurogroup, said he and the other members were befuddled by the euro's continued strength against the yuan, even as the Chinese currency gains steadily against the dollar.
8695	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the euro," Juncker told reporters.
8696	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"We do think we have to correct this obvious imbalance," Juncker said.
8697	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is leading the EU delegation, met with a rising star of the Chinese political establishment.

8705	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Riot police surrounded the building as a Sudanese court began proceedings Thursday in the case of a British teacher charged with inciting religious hatred -- a crime punishable by up to 40 lashes -- over letting her pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad.
8706	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Gillian Gibbons, in a dark jacket and blue skirt, was not handcuffed but looked tired as she walked into the courtroom in Khartoum, according to reporters inside, before media were ordered out of the chamber.
8707	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	There was confusion in the crowded courthouse as authorities barred British diplomats and Gibbons' employer from entering the chamber.
8708	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Sudan's prosecutor-general Salah Eddin Abu Zaid said Gibbons, who could face also face six months in jail and a fine if convicted, will receive a "swift and fair trial."
8709	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The case has sparked tensions between Sudan and Britain, the country's former colonial ruler.
8710	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	British Foreign Secretary David Miliband was meeting Thursday with Sudan's ambassador to inquire about the case.
8711	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"There is an innocent misunderstanding at the heart of this, not a criminal offense," Miliband told reporters.
8712	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	British diplomats "will do everything to avoid" any of the possible sentences that could be imposed on Gibbons, he said.
8713	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Officials at the Unity High School, a private school where Gibbons teaches, say the teddy bear was part of a class project to teach her 7-year-old pupils about animals.
8714	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	She asked the students to name the bear and they chose the name Muhammad, a common name among Muslim men.
8715	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Each child was allowed to take the bear home on weekends and write a diary about what they did with it.
8716	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The diary entries were collected in a book with the bear's picture on the cover, labeled, "My Name is Muhammad," according to the school director, Robert Boulos.
8717	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	But Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after complaints that she had insulted Prophet Muhammad, the most revered figure in Islam, by applying his name to a toy animal.
8718	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	It was unclear who made the complaint.
8719	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Boulos told media earlier in the week it came from several parents, but on Thursday he told The Associated Press that police informed him it came from a staffer at the school.
8720	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"We hope the case will be dismissed," he said, adding the school could hire private guards to protect Gibbons' when she returned.
8721	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"She is a marvelous teacher, she was even training our other primary teachers."
8722	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The school, which has about 750 students from elementary through high school, most from affluent Sudanese Muslim families, has been closed since her arrest.
8723	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Sudan's top Muslim clerics on Wednesday demanded the government punish her, saying she intentionally insulted the prophet and comparing her action to the "blasphemies" of author Salman Rushdie.
8724	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Hard-liners have considerable weight in the government of President Omar al-Bashir, which came to power in a 1989 military coup that touted itself as creating an Islamic state.
8725	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Gibbons' chief defense lawyer Kamal Djizouri scuffled with police in the tight cordon outside the courtroom before he was allowed in.
8726	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He briefly came out to say the proceedings were postponed as the plaintiff had not yet shown up.
8727	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Boulos said the plaintiff was the Sudanese ministry of education.
8728	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Djizouri, the lawyer, told The AP he would argue her case on the basis of Islamic Sharia law to show there was "absolutely no intention to insult religion, and for blasphemy to take place there must be an insult."
8729	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"There is a very big difference between the holy character of Prophet Muhammad and the name Muhammad given to a person," he said, pointing out that it is the most widespread first name in the Arab world.

8732	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped the trial would be finished Thursday.
8733	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Hearings in Sudan are usually public, but police barred entry, including to British diplomats who had come to observe.

8735	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Episcopalian Bishop Ezekiel Kondo, Gibbons' employer, also barred, said he was there "as a witness to testify that she never intended to insult any religion."
8736	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He denied reports that the school had fired Gibbons.
8737	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Sudan's Foreign Ministry has sought to play down the case, and the embassy in London initially predicted she would not be charged.
8738	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Embassy spokesman Khalid al Mubarak said Thursday he did not expect her to be convicted.
8739	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	But there were signs the case could become a rallying case for Islamic hard-liners.

8757	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	KANDAHAR, Afghanistan 2007-12-02 11:46:07 UTC
8758	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Afghan and NATO-led troops battled with Taliban militants and called in airstrikes in a series of clashes in the country's south that left 40 insurgents dead, an official said Sunday.
8759	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	The joint force clashed with militants in the mountainous Shah Wali Kot district in Kandahar province during a three-day operation that ended Saturday and left 35 insurgents dead, said provincial police chief Sayed Agha Saqib.
8760	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Ten other insurgents were detained near the militants' mountainous hide-outs, which they used to launch attacks against Afghan and foreign troops in the area, Saqib said.
8761	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Authorities recovered the militants' bodies along with their automatic weapons and ammunition, he said.
8762	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	In Kandahar's Zhari district, Afghan and foreign troops clashed with another group of militants hiding in a compound Saturday night, killing five militants and detaining four others, Saqib said.
8763	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Among those killed was a regional militant commander, Mullah Faizullah, he said.
8764	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	There were no casualties among Afghan or foreign troops during the operations, Saqib said.
8765	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	The reports could not be independently verified because the areas are remote and inaccessible.
8766	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	This year has been the most violent since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.
8767	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Insurgency-related violence has claimed nearly 6,200 lives, according to a tally of figures from Afghan and Western officials.
8768	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Separately, Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that current plans to have a 70,000-member Afghan army by the end of 2008 will not be sufficient to ensure the country's stability.
8769	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	"We think that an army of 200,000 troops is in the best interest of both Afghanistan and the international community," said Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a ministry spokesman.
8770	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	The current plan for troop numbers was set before the Taliban-led insurgency engulfed the country and is not adequate, Azimi said.
8771	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	About 50,000 Afghan army soldiers and 75,000 police have been trained so far, with plans to create a 70,000-member army and 82,000-strong police force by the end of 2008.
8772	APW_ENG_20071202.0341.LDC2009T13	Training and equipping of the Afghan army and police are a key element of the Western strategy of ensuring stability in the country and allowing the drawdown of foreign troops.

8779	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Five busloads of Palestinians entered Israeli territory and then crossed into Egypt through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, said Shadi Yassin, a spokesman for the Israeli civil administration.
8780	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	About 50 others who were expected to pass today are now scheduled to be released tomorrow, Yassin said.
8781	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israeli security forces prevented two others from leaving Gaza.
8782	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We intend to continue to get as many people as possible out of Gaza over the next few days," Yassin said.
8783	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time ever that people have been crossed through Kerem Shalom," a crossing where the borders of Gaza, Egypt and Israel meet.
8784	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Gaza's border crossings closed since June, when the Islamic militant Hamas seized control of the territory.
8785	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a time.
8786	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
8787	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	One of the protesters, Salman Fawaz, 55, said he worked as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia and had been home for a visit when Hamas seized control and the borders closed.
8788	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	His work visa in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of those allowed to leave.
8789	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Fawaz blamed Gaza's Hamas leadership and its rival, the moderate government of President Mahmoud Abbas, which rules the West Bank.
8790	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"Both are responsible for our suffering," Fawaz said.
8791	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The protest ended when Palestinian border officials promised that all of the about 5,000 Gazans still waiting to leave would be allowed out within 10 days.
8792	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We are pleased to learn that 250 people were (allowed to cross), but this is very minor number of people compared to the general population," said Noga Eitan, spokeswoman for the Gisha Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, an Israeli human rights group.
8793	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"It's possible to have an effective, efficient mechanism that will get the human beings of Gaza and out of the enormous jail they are in."

8797	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said the Boeing MD-90 had been grounded and authorities were investigating how and when the piece fell off.

8799	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Lion Air representatives were not immediately available for comment.
8800	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Last month, a similar-sized piece of wing fell from a jetliner minutes after it took off from the same airport.

8805	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	SEOUL, South Korea 2007-12-08 03:56:34 UTC
8806	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Oil from a damaged supertanker has reached South Korea's western shore, a Coast Guard official said Saturday, deepening fears of environmental damage from the country's largest oil spill.
8807	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	About 7 kilometers (4 miles) of coastline near Mallipo beach, approximately 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, has been affected by the oil, said Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at the Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon.
8808	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Jung said it was unclear how serious the contamination was.
8809	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The region is popular for its scenic beaches and is also the site of fish farms, a national maritime park and is an important rest stop for migrating birds.
8810	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters
8811	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	2.7 million gallons) of oil gushed Friday from the Hong Kong-registered tanker after a crane-carrying barge slammed into it.
8812	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The spill was the country's largest, involving twice as much oil as the worst previous spill in 1995.
8813	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The accident occurred about 7 miles (11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach.
8814	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Strong winds and prevailing currents have spread the oil slick to an area about 1 mile (2 kilometers) wide and 10 miles (20 kilometers) in length, Jung said.
8815	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	YTN television showed a contaminated beach, with some rocks and sand stained in black.
8816	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The Coast Guard planned to mobilize 103 vessels and six helicopters Saturday in an effort to clean it up, Jung said, adding that the operation was expected to take at least three days.
8817	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	"We're doing our best to remove the contamination as quickly as possible, but it will take some time to clean up the shore because it needs to be done by hand," said Kim Woon-tae, a Coast Guard official stationed in the region.
8818	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Kim said oil was still trickling out of the punctured tanker, but the hole would soon be sealed completely.
8819	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Chang Geun-ho, an official of the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry, said Friday that the extent of environmental damage would depend on the success of the containment operation, though he added that cold winter temperatures could help slow the spread of the oil slick by freezing it.
8820	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The size of the leak reported by the authorities would be about one-fourth that of the 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons, of oil spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
8821	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.
8822	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	There were no casualties in the accident, it said.
8823	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- about 1.8 million barrels -- to be loaded into boats from a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was being towed by a small tug boat, said Kim Tae-ho, another Coast Guard official.
8824	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to high winds, waves and currents, he said.
8825	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Kim said the Coast Guard planned to question the barge's captain to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy weather.
8826	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The July 1995 leak caused damage estimated at 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million).

8829	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The mother of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager whose life-ending battle with AIDS in the 1980s engrossed Americans, wants to meet with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to discuss his comments 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been isolated.
8830	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The former Arkansas governor and Republican front-runner in the important Iowa caucuses said Sunday that he stood by the comments.
8831	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	That has infuriated Jeanne White-Ginder, who said: "It's so alarming to me."
8832	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press from her home in Leesburg, Florida, she said: "It's very important to me that we don't live in the darkness" when people thought AIDS was transmitted through casual contact, such as by "kissing, tears, sweat and saliva."
8833	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"We have to treat this disease like a disease, and like Ryan always said, not like a dirty word," she said.
8834	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	White was 13 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984, having contracted the disease from the blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
8835	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He was barred from school the following year out of fear the disease was spread casually.
8836	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He died in 1990 at age 18.
8837	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, and the AIDS Institute were sending a letter to Huckabee asking him to meet with White-Ginder -- who declined in the interview to say what political party she belongs to -- and calling his comments "completely beyond comprehension."
8838	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	As a Senate candidate in 1992, Huckabee told the AP in a questionnaire that "we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague" if the federal government was going to deal with the spread of the disease effectively.
8839	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents," he said then.
8840	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Huckabee denied that those words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population, although he did not explain how else isolation would be achieved.
8841	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I didn't say we should quarantine," he said.
8842	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The idea was not to "lock people up."
8843	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then, and since, that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through casual contact, but said that was not certain.
8844	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I still believe this today," Huckabee said Sunday, that "we were acting more out of political correctness" in responding to the AIDS crisis.
8845	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I don't run from it, I don't recant it," he said of his position in 1992.
8846	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Yet he said he would state his view differently in retrospect.
8847	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee outlined his views in 1992 for the AP more than a year after President George H.W. Bush, a fellow Republican, urged an audience of business executives not to fire or otherwise discriminate against employees infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

8849	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2007-12-11 14:48:50 UTC
8850	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	Chemical company Wacker Chemie AG said Tuesday it will buy out its two joint ventures with Air Products and Chemicals Inc. in an effort to strengthen its global polymers business.
8851	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	The two ventures are Air Products Polymers and Wacker Polymer Systems.
8852	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	Completion of the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected in the first quarter of 2008.
8853	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	"Wacker expects that the acquisition will provide strategic advantages to its global construction-polymers business," the company said in a statement.
8854	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	"Benefits include synergies and cost advantages."
8855	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	Wacker will retain the Vinyl Acetate Ethylene activities of the joint venture, while Air Products will receive full ownership in the Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and their related businesses plus cash considerations of US$265 million (euro180.62).
8856	APW_ENG_20071211.0876.LDC2009T13	Wacker shares rose 0.2 percent to euro183.15 (US$268.77) in Frankfurt.

8868	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-12-13 20:28:33 UTC
8869	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Congressional Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a bill to keep the U.S. government open for another week as lawmakers fashioned an omnibus spending bill and sought agreement among themselves and with the White House.
8870	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The House passed the short-term funding bill by a 385-27 vote
8871	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	the Senate will clear the bill for President George W. Bush signing before the current temporary funding bill runs out Friday.
8872	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments whose budgets have yet to pass.
8873	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It is expected the omnibus measure will pass by then, allowing Congress to finally adjourn for the year.
8874	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats announced Wednesday they would all but surrender to President George W. Bush's demand that lawmakers appropriate no more than $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) for annual operating expenses for Cabinet departments whose budgets are set each year by Congress.
8875	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of the politically sacrosanct program.
8876	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But Democrats had yet to resolve differences among themselves, much less with the White House.
8877	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Differences over Iraq and whether to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still to be resolved.
8878	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	"I have no agreement at this stage with the people in the House, the Republicans in the Senate, and the White House," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.
8879	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House was quick to say it had not signed on to the Democrats' measure, awaiting details of the bill's final cost, the funding mix within accounts, and the resolution of its request for additional Iraq and Afghanistan war funds.
8880	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	"We're hopeful and encouraged by the movement that we're seeing on the Hill right now," said White House budget office spokesman Sean Kevelighan.
8881	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
8882	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That approach has been widely seen as unrealistic, even by top Republicans like House Minority Leader John Boehner.
8883	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But with the White House playing such a strong hand in the negotiations, Boehner now insists Democrats stick within the president's $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) figure, with exceptions for border security and a few other "emergencies."
8884	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The issue of Iraq has yet to be resolved, though expectations were growing that Senate Democrats would relent and allow Republicans to provide up to $70 billion (euro47.6 billion) in new war funds to the measure, without restrictions that have provoked Bush veto threats, such as a December 2008 target date for withdrawing combat troops.
8885	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The bill will not carry Iraq aid when passing the House next week, though Democrats have said they will attach about $30 billion (euro20.4 billion) for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and some domestic Pentagon needs.
8886	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps months of wrangling.
8887	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23 billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the funding to increases for domestic programs such as health research, education, grants to state and local governments and energy research.
8888	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	More recently, Democrats worked with pragmatic appropriations panel Republicans such as Sen. Thad Cochran and Rep. James Walsh to craft a split-the-differences bill cutting $11 billion (euro7.4 billion) from the earlier Democratic measures.
8889	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat Saturday.
8890	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Now, lawmakers led by House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey and his Senate counterpart Robert Byrd, both Democrats, are squeezing the remaining funding bills by another 1.6 percent, said a Byrd spokesman.
8891	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The measure would fund every Cabinet department except the Pentagon.
8892	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Under Bush's budget, domestic Cabinet departments other than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would see their budgets frozen.
8893	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Considering inflation and population gains, that means most programs would not be able to deliver a comparable level of services next year as they do now.

8896	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Using the military to track Japanese whalers as part of Australia's anti-whaling campaign could cause a diplomatic rift with Tokyo, the opposition warned Friday.
8897	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters Thursday that he will detail next week how his government intends to gather evidence of illegal conduct by Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean in the coming weeks.
8898	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	A week before his Labor Party won elections on Nov. 24, a senior colleague Robert McClelland promised military resources would be used to monitor the Japanese fleet.
8899	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Rudd on Thursday would not rule out using warships and air force planes to take pictures that could bolster Australia's case in an international court against Japanese whaling in the Australia- declared whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean.
8900	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	"We would not rule out the use of Australian assets to collect appropriate data, including photographic evidence concerning whaling activities," Rudd said.
8901	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Labor in opposition had promised a tougher stance against the annual Japanese slaughter of hundreds of whales in the southern sanctuary, which Japan does not recognize.
8902	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Brendan Nelson, who was defense minister before the election, questioned whether such a military deployment would harm relations with Japan, Australia's second most important trading partner after China.
8903	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	"I would be very concerned about sending war assets -- warships and air force planes -- down to look at the Japanese whaling fleet in terms of how is that going to escalate the diplomatic tensions between Australia and Japan," Nelson told reporters.
8904	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Japan is allowed by the International Whaling Commission to harpoon whales for scientific research and to sell the carcasses commercially.
8905	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Labor argues that Australia could take action against the whalers in the International Court of Justice in The Hague or the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea in Hamburg to add to international pressure against whaling.
8906	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Masatoshi Wakabayashi, whose responsibilities include whaling, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio through an interpreter that Japan "will not tolerate any moves to obstruct our research whaling program."

8941	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2007-12-21 11:30:29 UTC
8942	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	There are "major uncertainties" swirling around the economic outlook for the euro zone in 2008, the president of the European Central Bank said.
8943	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	In an interview with EuroNews that aired Friday, Jean-Claude Trichet said that the bank's governing council, which sets interest rates for the 13-nation euro zone, are worried about the risk of weaker growth.
8944	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It is true there are major uncertainties with regard to the economic situation," he said.
8945	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"The council of governors of the ECB feels that there is a greater risk of weaker growth, with it going below around 2 percent."
8946	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	A transcript of the interview, along with a video, was posted on the broadcaster's Web site.
8947	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview with RTL radio on Friday that global growth will be hit by the subprime crisis.
8948	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"France will be hit, like unfortunately all countries, by a lower growth rate," making the government's forecast of a 2.25 percent pace difficult to achieve, he said.
8949	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It could be that the end of 2008 is a rebound moment if we see after six months that all the accounts have been balanced and confidence returns."
8950	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet, asked why the bank has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent since June, Trichet said the ECB has been acting within its mission to control inflation.
8951	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Our first mandate -- which the treaty requires of us and our fellow citizens demand of us -- is to ensure medium-term price stability is in line with our target, that is inflation of less than 2 percent and around 2 percent," he said.
8952	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"In terms of the 320 million people living in the euro zone we therefore make our monetary policy decisions to ensure price stability.
8953	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	That is our principal mandate."
8954	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet also reiterated previous remarks that the bank would not tolerate the excuse of higher energy and food prices as a reason to increase wages, thus spurring inflation.
8955	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Because then, we would have what we call second-round effects, leading to inflation which would be long lasting, instead of being temporary and related to higher costs for oil and raw materials and we would be unable to comply with our mandate, to ensure price stability, and we wouldn't be doing what our fellow citizens expressly ask us to," Trichet said.
8956	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, the bank said it would mop up as much as euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion) in a move to drain liquidity from the markets.
8957	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The bank also reaffirmed its intent to keep steering liquidity to a more balanced condition so as to align short-term interest rates with the refinancing minimum bid rate, which is 4 percent.
8958	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The move followed a similar operation on Thursday, that was also for euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion).

8965	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Six French aid workers on trial on kidnapping charges in Chad were trying to save children they believed to be Darfur orphans, and therefore cannot be charged under international law, their lawyers said Friday moments before the trial began.
8966	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	"We shall argue for an acquittal.
8967	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Evacuating children in danger is provided for under the Geneva Convention, and those who evacuate them can face no criminal liability," said Celine Lorenzon.
8968	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The defense team then began the trial by presenting a petition to nullify the proceedings against the aid workers.
8969	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The six, who work for the French charity Zoe's Ark, face 20 years in prison with hard labor if they are found guilty of trying to kidnap 103 African children last October.
8970	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The French say the children had been orphaned by the conflict in the neighboring Sudanese region of Darfur, and that they had arranged for French families to care for them.
8971	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	But subsequent investigations revealed that most of the children were Chadians with living parents or adults they regarded as parents.
8972	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Gilbert Collard, another defense lawyer, said that the accused will argue, "they did not come here to do harm, but to apply the legal doctrine of saving lives at any price.
8973	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	They admit that they did not follow the usual methods of humanitarian aid."
8974	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Collard insisted that the defense team had "all the evidence to show that it was not kidnapping but a desire to save children in a humanitarian context."
8975	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The aid workers, from a group called Zoe's Ark, have been on a hunger strike since earlier this month to draw attention to the case, saying they feel abandoned by the French government.
8976	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Collard had said Thursday his clients were "very tired, very depressed, very discouraged.
8977	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The hunger strike has made them very weak and the situation is really tragic."
8978	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The parents of many of the children say that they were told their children would be going to school in Chad, and there was no mention of a trip to France.
8979	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Other children said they were lured away from their families with sweets.
8980	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The aid workers also reportedly applied fake blood and bandages to the children, although none of them had been wounded, in preparation for a planned flight to France.
8981	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Chadian police stopped their convoy of all-terrain vehicles on its way to the airport with the children on Oct. 25, and the six have been jailed since then in a case that has drawn wide attention, sparked anti-French demonstrations here and created diplomatic tensions between Chad and France.
8982	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	In Paris Friday, Jean-Marie Bockel, a junior minister for relations with French-speaking nations, told France's LCI television officials "at the highest levels" in France and Chad, including the presidents of the two countries, were discussing the case with the aim of bringing the six to France quickly following the trial.
8983	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	A France-Chad agreement allows for citizens of one country convicted in the other to serve sentences at home.
8984	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Chadian officials, however, have argued that the agreement only applies in cases where it is not clear where an offense was committed, so the Zoe's Ark case does not fall under it.
8985	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Bockel said that while France was working extremely hard on behalf of its citizens, it was taking care not to create "concerns and misunderstandings related to the question of (Chad's) sovereignty, which could complicate matters."
8986	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Three Chadians and one Sudanese refugee have also been charged with conspiracy.
8987	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Some Chadians have expressed anger that the African prisoners may be judged by a harsher standard since they have no European government to intervene on their behalf.
8988	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Eleven other foreigners -- three French journalists who had been reporting on the planned evacuation and seven Spanish flight crew members and a Belgian pilot hired to fly out the children -- have been released and flown home.

8990	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	KINGSTON, Jamaica 2007-12-21 15:21:17 UTC
8991	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	A nephew of Trevor Berbick has been convicted along with another man of killing the 54-year-old former heavyweight champion.
8992	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	A jury Thursday found 21-year-old Harold Berbick guilty of murder and 19-year-old Kenton Gordon guilty of manslaughter in the death of the former boxer following a four-week trial.
8993	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	The judge ordered both men jailed pending their Jan. 11 sentencing.
8994	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	Authorities said the nephew and Gordon beat Berbick to death in October, leaving his body in a church courtyard in Portland.
8995	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	Harold Berbick had been involved in a land dispute with his uncle.
8996	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	Trevor Berbick was the last fighter to face Muhammad Ali in the ring and briefly held the WBC heavyweight title before losing it to Mike Tyson in 1986.
8997	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	Berbick fought from 1976-2000, finishing with a record of 50-11 with one draw and 33 knockouts.
8998	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	Following his retirement from the ring, Berbick was beset by legal problems, including convictions for sexual assault, grand theft and burglary, that led to his being deported from the U.S. back to his native Jamaica.

9000	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2007-12-30 00:12:08 UTC
9001	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden warned Iraq's Sunni Arabs against fighting al- Qaida and vowed to expand the terror group's holy war to Israel in a new audiotape Saturday, threatening "blood for blood, destruction for destruction."
9002	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Most of the 56-minute tape dealt with Iraq, apparently al-Qaida's latest attempt to keep supporters in Iraq unified at a time when the U.S. military claims to have al-Qaida's Iraq branch on the run.
9003	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape did not mention Pakistan or the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, though Pakistan's government has blamed al-Qaida and the Taliban for her death on Thursday.
9004	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	That suggested the tape was made before the assassination.
9005	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's comments offered an unusually direct attack on Israel, stepping up al-Qaida's attempts to use the Israeli-Arab conflict to rally supporters.
9006	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Israel has warned of growing al- Qaida activity in Palestinian territory, though terror network is not believed to have taken a strong role there so far.
9007	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"We intend to liberate Palestine, the whole of Palestine from the (Jordan) river to the sea," he said, threatening "blood for blood, destruction for destruction."
9008	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"We will not recognize even one inch for Jews in the land of Palestine as other Muslim leaders have," bin Laden said.
9009	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In Iraq, a number of Sunni Arab tribes in western Anbar province have formed a coalition fighting al-Qaida-linked insurgents that U.S. officials credit for deeply reducing violence in the province.
9010	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has been working to form similar "Awakening Councils" in other areas of Iraq.
9011	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunni Arabs who have joined the Awakening Councils "have betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people.
9012	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	They will suffer in life and in the afterlife."
9013	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	White House spokesman Tony Fratto said bin Laden's tape shows that al-Qaida's aim is to block democracy and freedom for all Iraqis.
9014	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"It also reminds us that the mission to defeat al-Qaida in Iraq is critically important and must succeed," Fratto said.
9015	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"The Iraqi people -- every day, and in increasing numbers -- are choosing freedom and standing against the murderous, hateful ideology of AQI.
9016	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	And we stand with them."
9017	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Several hours before the tape was issued, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, said al-Qaida was becoming increasingly fearful of losing the support of Sunni Arabs and had begun targeting the leaders of the Awakening Councils.
9018	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Petraeus said al-Qaida attaches "enormous importance" to "these tribes that have turned against them, and to the general sense that Sunni Arab communities have rejected them more and more around Iraq."
9019	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al- Qaida, he said.
9020	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In the audiotape, bin Laden denounced Abdul-Sattar Abu Risha, the former leader of the Anbar Awakening Council, who was killed in a September bombing claimed by al-Qaida.
9021	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"The most evil of the traitors are those who trade away their religion for the sake of their mortal life," bin Laden said.
9022	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said U.S. and Iraqi officials are seeking to set up a "national unity government" joining the country's Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.
9023	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Our duty is to foil these dangerous schemes, which try to prevent the establishment of an Islamic state in Iraq, which would be a wall of resistance against American schemes to divide Iraq," he said.
9024	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	He called on Iraq's Sunni Arabs to rally behind the Islamic State of Iraq, the insurgent umbrella group led by al-Qaida.
9025	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Besides the Awakening Councils, some Sunni insurgent groups that continue to fight the Americans have rejected the Islamic State.
9026	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunnis should pledge their allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the little known "emir" or leader of the Islamic State of Iraq.
9027	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have claimed that al-Baghdadi does not exist, saying al-Qaida created the name to give its coalition the illusion of an Iraqi leadership.
9028	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Failure to give allegiance to the emir after he has been endorsed leads to great evils," bin Laden warned.
9029	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Emir Abu Omar would rather have his neck severed than betray the Muslims ... Emir Abu Omar and his brothers are not one of those who accept compromise or meeting the enemy halfway."
9030	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The authenticity of the tape could not be independently confirmed.
9031	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	But the voice resembled that of bin Laden.
9032	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, issues the group's messages.
9033	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing any tapes.
9034	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years.
9035	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The other messages this year have been audiotapes.
9036	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In an October tape, bin Laden sought to patch up splits between Iraqi insurgent factions, urging them to unite with the Islamic State of Iraq -- the insurgent coalition led by al-Qaida.
9037	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	He took a conciliatory stance, chiding even al-Qaida's followers for being too "extremist" in their positions toward other insurgents.
9038	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec. 16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti- Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone cooperating with the Americans.

9041	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	Kenya's Attorney General Amos Wako called Thursday for an independent body to verify the vote tally from a disputed presidential election that has sparked violence across the country.
9042	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	Kenya's electoral commission had named President Mwai Kibaki winner of the Dec. 27 vote, but rival Raila Odinga alleges fraud and says the vote was rigged.
9043	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	Foreign observers have questioned the vote count, as has the chief of the nation's electoral commission.
9044	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	"Because of the perception that the presidential results were rigged, it is necessary ... that a proper tally of the valid certificates returned and confirmed should be undertaken immediately" by an independent body, Wako said in a statement.
9045	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	The dispute has led to political violence, as well as ethnic clashes between Kibaki's Kikuyu group and Odinga's Luo.
9046	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	The independent Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International Federation for Human Rights said in a joint statement that more than 300 people had been killed nationwide since Dec. 27, and the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated more than 100,000 people have had to flee their homes

9048	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2008-01-03 20:52:40 UTC
9049	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	The militant al-Qaida group announced Thursday the imminent arrival of a new video message from American-born Islamist Adam Gadahn, making it the first message from the organization in 2008.
9050	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	"Coming soon by the will of God, an invitation to reflection and repentance," read the banner produced by al-Sahab, al-Qaida's media wing, and displayed on a militant Web site.
9051	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	An image of the bearded Gadahn wearing a red and white checkered Arab scarf appears on the banner.
9052	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	The California-born Gadahn, also known as Azzam al-Amriki, was charged with treason in the U.S. in fall 2006 and has been wanted since 2004 by the FBI, which is offering a US$1 million (euro0.73 million) reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction.
9053	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	He last appeared on a video in August threatening new attacks on foreign embassies.

9055	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	DAMASCUS, Syria 2008-01-06 12:01:29 UTC
9056	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	Syrian authorities have released a rights activist connected to a well-known pro-democracy group after a four-day detention, a local human rights organization said Sunday.
9057	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush recently criticized Syria for detaining members of the so-called "Damascus Declaration" group, including Rashed Sattouf, and called for their release.
9058	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	Authorities released Sattouf on Saturday, four days after he was arrested in the northern city of Raqqa, the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.
9059	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	Syria cracked down on the Damascus Declaration group, arresting nine members, after it held a December meeting that brought together opposition groups and activists calling for democratic reform.
9060	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	Sattouf did not attend the December meeting, according to the rights group, and his release reduced the number being held to eight.
9061	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	The "Damascus Declaration" was signed in 2005 by about 500 Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals who urged the Syrian government to improve ties with neighboring Lebanon, a sensitive issue in Syria.
9062	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	Syrian officials, who usually do not comment on domestic security matters, have not commented on the recent arrests.
9063	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	During a brief period after taking office in 2000, President Bashar Assad released hundreds of political prisoners -- a move seen at the time as an opening up of Syrian society.
9064	APW_ENG_20080106.0343.LDC2009T13	But he has subsequently clamped down on pro-democracy activists, showing there are limits to the dissent he is willing to tolerate.

9079	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	JAKARTA, Indonesia 2008-01-12 04:38:40 UTC
9080	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Former Indonesian dictator Suharto showed slight signs of improvement, doctors said Saturday, a day after he suffered organ failure and was placed on a ventilator with dangerous signs of infection in his lungs.
9081	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Physicians described his condition as "alarming" Friday, and family members and friends rushed to his bedside, some reciting prayers and verses from the Quran as he started to lose consciousness.
9082	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said she was pessimistic, telling El-Shinta radio the ventilator was a "last attempt" by doctors to keep him alive.
9083	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	"I don't think it will help," she said.
9084	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	But chief presidential doctor Marjo Subiandono said there were signs of improvement overnight.
9085	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	"Generally, his condition is better," he said, adding while Suharto remained on a ventilator, antibiotics appeared to be having an effect on his infected lungs.
9086	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	"He's more aware, responsive."
9087	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Suharto's blood pressure was also stable, Subiandono said, though there was some bleeding in the stomach.
9088	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Suharto, whose regime was widely regarded as one of the 20th century's most brutal and corrupt, was hospitalized in critical condition one week ago with anemia and a low heart rate.
9089	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	He initially responding well to a blood transfusion and kidney dialysis, but days later his condition sharply deteriorated.
9090	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	The retired five-star general was ousted in 1998 amid massive student protests and nationwide riots, opening the way for democracy in this predominantly Muslim nation of 235 million people.
9091	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	He withdrew from public life, venturing from his comfortable villa on a leafy lane in the capital only to attend family functions or for medical emergencies.
9092	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	A series of strokes in recent years have left Suharto with permanent brain damage and impaired speech -- keeping him from facing trial.
9093	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	He has been accused of overseeing a purge of more than a half-million leftist opponents soon after seizing power in a 1965 coup.
9094	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of thousands more were killed or imprisoned in the decades that followed -- crimes for which no one has ever been punished.
9095	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Transparency International says Suharto and his family also amassed billions of dollars in state funds -- an allegation he has denied.
9096	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Aids said privately that Suharto appeared to be on the verge of death late Friday, and Health Minister Supari told El-Shinta she strongly advised doctors against placing him on a ventilator.
9097	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	She said he should be allowed to die in peace.
9098	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Family members, however, decided to go ahead.
9099	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	A member of Suharto's medical team, Joko Raharjo, said the former dictator was conscious early Saturday and nodded when spoken to.
9100	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	His organs appeared to be functioning better, even though there was still some fluid buildup.
9101	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	"This morning the team of doctors will try to improve his general condition by giving him a blood transfusion and medicine to continue fighting the infection in his lungs and to balance his body fluid," said Subiandono, the other doctor.

9103	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	LAHORE, Pakistan 2008-01-12 17:55:49 UTC
9104	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Six Pakistani militants arrested last month were "brainwashed" by radical clerics near the Afghan border and had been plotting suicide attacks against military targets, an intelligence official said Saturday.
9105	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the military claimed to have inflicted significant casualties on militants in fighting in the past few days in the border region, an insurgent stronghold where top al-Qaida and Taliban leaders are thought to find a haven.
9106	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The battles took place near a military camp in Ladha in South Waziristan between Wednesday and Friday, said army spokesman Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad.
9107	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"The militants suffered heavy casualties, but we cannot give any specific number on their dead," he said, without giving further details.
9108	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The six suspects, one of whom is a retired army major with alleged links to al-Qaida, were arrested in December in raids in different parts of eastern Punjab province.
9109	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The arrests were only made public within the past week.
9110	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"These people were preparing for suicide attacks against the army," the Pakistani official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.
9111	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We found explosives, suicide belts and maps of military installations" in their hideouts, he said.
9112	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The suspects, who have yet to be charged, received training and religious instruction in tribal areas near the Afghan border, the official said.
9113	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The official said the suspects were "brainwashed" by clerics in the area.
9114	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We learned from them that they wanted to attack the army to avenge the killings of fellow militants," he said.
9115	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"They were convinced that they would go to paradise after sacrificing their life."
9116	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The detained men had been working under Ahsanul Haq, a retired army major with alleged links to al-Qaida.
9117	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Haq was the mastermind of a Nov. 1 suicide attack on a Pakistan Air Force bus that killed eight people in Sargodha, a city about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the capital, Islamabad, the intelligence official said.
9118	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, police fatally shot two suspected militants in a shootout late Friday in Multan, a city in Punjab province, said Fayyaz Ahmad, an area police chief.
9119	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Three other suspects fled, Ahmad said.
9120	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Ahmad said that police told the men to stop their vehicle, but that the men had opened fire instead, wounding one of the officers.
9121	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Pakistan, a key U.S. ally in the war on terrorism, has seen an increase in suicide attacks in the past three months.
9122	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The most recent took place Thursday when 24 people, most of them police officers, were killed in a blast in Lahore city, Punjab's capital.

9127	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	DURBAN, South Africa 2008-01-12 20:12:12 UTC
9128	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Fast bowler Dale Steyn took six West Indies wickets on Saturday to lead South Africa to easy victory in the third test and a 2-1 win in the three-match series.
9129	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn finished with 6-72 and South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs -- with two days to spare -- after West Indies' second innings ended at 317-9.
9130	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unable to bat because of flu.
9131	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	South Africa allrounder Shaun Pollock, his country's highest-ever test wicket-taker, announced his retirement after the match.
9132	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	West Indies won the first test by 128 runs and South Africa leveled the series with a seven-wicket win in the second test.
9133	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But West Indies faced an uphill task to save the third test after South Africa dismissed the visitors for 139 in their first innings at Kingsmead Stadium, and then scored 556-4 in reply.
9134	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	After a fourth-wicket stand of 144 between Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo, Steyn struck with the second new ball of the innings, dismissing Bravo leg before wicket for 75 soon after tea.
9135	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But Samuels managed to bring up his second test century, making 105 off 190 balls with 18 boundaries.
9136	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We fought well," Bravo said.
9137	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We must remember South Africa is the No. 2 team in the world, and we are a young team with new coaching staff."
9138	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Despite winning the series, South Africa dropped two places to fourth spot in test rankings, the International Cricket Council said.
9139	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Australia remained top.
9140	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Denesh Ramdin stayed with Samuels and made 25 before Andre Nel tempted him to flash at a wide delivery outside the off stump and give an easy catch to Mark Boucher.
9141	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shortly after making his century, Samuels fell to a delivery from Steyn which clipped his off stump.
9142	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	The dismissal signaled a collapse for West Indies, and Steyn ripped through the rest of the tail.
9143	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Darren Sammy was out for 17 in a looping caught-and-bowled by Steyn, who also hit the offstumps of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards -- both for ducks -- to wrap up the match.
9144	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the series at an average of 19.10.
9145	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Samuels and Bravo saw West Indies reach 230-3 at tea after a poor start to the day.
9146	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Resuming on their overnight total of 23, opening batsmen Darren Ganga and Brenton Parchment added 10 more runs before Parchment was trapped leg before wicket by Steyn for 20.
9147	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
9148	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before wicket for 37.
9149	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut back in on him.
9150	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock, 34, later announced it was his last test.
9151	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"It's great to be able to finish my test career on my home ground, and especially in a match where the guys played so well," said Pollock, who said he would retire from international cricket after the one-day series against West Indies that finishes next month.
9152	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"But with Dale bowling so well, they don't need me," added Pollock, who took a record 421 test wickets for South Africa at an average of 23.11.
9153	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock also averaged 32.31 with the bat, hitting a total of 3,781 test runs.
9154	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	South African captain Graeme Smith acknowledged the contribution Steyn made to the win, but said the day belonged to Pollock.
9155	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"I hope the whole of South Africa knows what a great player will be missing from our team now, he is one of the all-time greats," Smith said.
9156	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Also Saturday, Parchment was fined half his match fee by the ICC after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct.
9157	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"In the eighth over of West Indies second innings, Parchment intentionally ran into opposition fast bowler Dale Steyn," the ICC statement said.
9158	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Parchment has the right of appeal.

9172	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Environmental activists upset after Bush lets Navy use sonar training
9173	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-01-17 01:28:51 UTC
9174	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Conservationists criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's decision to exempt the Navy from an environmental law so it can continue using high-power sonar in its training off California -- a practice they say harms whales and other marine mammals.
9175	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The president's action will not allow the anti-submarine warfare training to go forward because an injunction is in place, but the Navy believes it will significantly strengthen its argument in court.
9176	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
9177	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
9178	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East.
9179	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the United States" and its national security.
9180	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Peter Douglas, the executive director of the California Coastal Commission, which joined in the lawsuit to give the marine mammals greater protections from sonar, called the exemption unprecedented in California.
9181	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"I'm not surprised at all," he said.
9182	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"It's typical for this Republican administration to ignore environmental protections under the banner of fear."
9183	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and ears.
9184	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
9185	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been fighting the Navy's sonar training, said the group would challenge Bush's exemption.
9186	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises.
9187	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar would have to be shut down when mammals were spotted within 2,200 yards (2,010 meters).
9188	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
9189	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Complying with the environmental law would "undermine the Navy's ability to conduct realistic training exercises that are necessary to ensure the combat effectiveness of carrier and expeditionary strike groups," Bush said.
9190	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other marine mammals.
9191	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.
9192	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might threaten its ships.
9193	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"We cannot in good conscience send American men and women into potential trouble spots without adequate training to defend themselves," said Roughead.

9202	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Beyond the barbed wire and camouflaged hangars that once housed Soviet-made fighter jets, some see hope for a small airport and a brighter tomorrow.
9203	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But the future may hold a different twist -- and has many locals fearful of Russian retaliation.
9204	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The shuttered air base in northern Poland, which dates back to World War II, is a likely site for 10 interceptors for the U.S. missile defense program, a plan Washington says is necessary to counter potential attacks from so-called rogue states.
9205	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Poland's new government is sounding increasingly skeptical about the plan, arguing that it won't boost Polish security -- a sentiment echoed throughout the farm country near the Baltic Sea coast, where residents struggle to see any benefits at all.
9206	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
9207	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Let's tell the truth here, it's not aimed against Iran, or against Vietnam or whatever -- it's against Russia."
9208	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The U.S. has been wrestling with such perceptions of its plan to place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic since opening negotiations with the two countries early last year.
9209	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Washington says the system is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from emerging threats from so-called rogue states such as Iran.
9210	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its security.
9211	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Last year, Gen. Nikolai Solovtsov, head of Russia's missile forces, warned that Moscow could target future bases in Poland and the Czech Republic with Russian missiles.
9212	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Residents in Slupsk, a town of 100,000 just 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the road, are worried, despite assurances from Polish officials that the region will be the nation's safest if it hosts the base.

9214	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	if the base gets built, the Russians will fire at us for sure, so we will in fact be the most threatened," says Zenon Kuwalko, a 54-year-old engineer from Slupsk.
9215	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.
9216	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"We have not received any benefits from our cooperation with the Americans so far -- not one thing," says Leszek Pieniak, 48, who owns the Pod Kogutem restaurant near the base.
9217	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not in Poland -- nothing.
9218	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	We don't even have visas.
9219	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	I'll tell my grandchildren that maybe in 20 years they'll have a shot at visa-free travel to the U.S."
9220	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I'm against the base and that's it."
9221	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.
9222	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I think that only a civilian airport and the economic development of the region will allow us to overcome unemployment and in the long run create jobs," says Jan Junczyk, 48, a reserve captain in Poland's air force who once flew MiG 23s at the base.
9223	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense block off and isolate our region."
9224	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Mariusz Chmiel, the county manager for the Slupsk region, which includes Redzikowo, agrees that an airport would help stimulate business and tourism in the area and help cut an unemployment rate that he says hovers above 20 percent.
9225	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Chmiel, along with a handful of other local officials, on the invitation of the U.S. Embassy in Poland, were flown in August to the U.S. to tour Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, home to missile interceptor silos.
9226	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The Poles also met with local Vandenberg residents to discuss the base's impact on the community and possible growth opportunities.
9227	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says Chmiel.
9228	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Movie review: Twisted revenge tale `Teeth ' will leave you laughing and squirming
9229	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-01-18 00:44:11 UTC
9230	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	The name "Teeth" may ring a bell with you.
9231	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's a film that had audiences laughing and squirming simultaneously last year at Sundance, where it earned an acting prize for its fresh-faced, fearless star, Jess Weixler.
9232	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth.
9233	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Yes, she is a living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his feature debut.
9234	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge tale.
9235	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross- out factor he'd established early on.
9236	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(You do see severed, um, parts.)
9237	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	For a while, though, it's easy to get engrossed in the surreal suburban life of Weixler's squeaky-clean Dawn, a pretty, poised high school student who goes around speaking to groups about the importance of abstinence.
9238	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	She's part of an organization known as The Promise, and gives out red plastic rings for kids to wear as a reminder of their chastity.
9239	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Even kissing is a no-no.
9240	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But Lichtenstein never makes fun of her, and Weixler, whose wholesome blond looks are reminiscent of a younger Heather Graham, treats the character with just as much respect.
9241	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Dawn may be fiercely protective of her innocence in reaction to an event that took place when she was a very young girl, something she doesn't even remember but we see at the film's start.
9242	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Her new stepbrother, Brad, tries to mess around with her while the two are in a kiddie wading pool and gets "bitten"
9243	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	years later, grown-up Brad (John Hensley from "Nip/Tuck"), is tatted, pierced, perpetually stoned and hates women.
9244	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But he still wants to do it with Dawn, and the fact that she's so fearful of her budding sexuality only makes her more desirable.
9245	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Being a teenager, though, her curiosity eventually takes over and she allows herself to become interested in a boy in the abstinence group, the slightly goofy Tobey (Hale Appleman).
9246	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But when he tries to go too far with her while swimming at the lake one afternoon, he learns too late that no really does mean no.
9247	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	A visit to the gynecologist to find out what's wrong with her also has disastrous consequences.
9248	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(It's the film's funniest scene, mainly because we all know what's coming and the arrogant doctor doesn't).
9249	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Eventually, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew (sorry, couldn't resist) as Dawn feels increasingly comfortable in her own skin and begins seducing men who deserve their comeuppance.
9250	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(Its climactic moment, if you will, is way too over the top.)
9251	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	And a subplot involving her dying mother seems out of place in contrast with the comedy.
9252	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But it's easy to imagine "Teeth" gaining a cult following through midnight showings
9253	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	it's the kind of movie you want to watch with friends, to laugh and scream and not have to think too hard, and then who knows?
9254	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Maybe go home and get lucky afterward.
9255	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	"Teeth," a Roadside Attractions release, runs 87 minutes.
9256	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Two and a half stars out of four.

9259	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Police officers were taped joking about a dying, homeless Guatemalan immigrant after he was found on the side of a deserted road in their suburban town, a television station reported.
9260	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	"You wanna hear something really funny?
9261	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	... He's alive," a Bedford police officer tells a sergeant on a taped phone call aired Thursday on WCBS-TV.
9262	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The two go on to marvel -- with the officer chuckling -- that Rene Perez had apparently revived himself temporarily after authorities thought him dead on April 28, 2007.
9263	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The television station said Perez died an hour after the officers' taped exchange.
9264	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez had had a series of encounters with police in Bedford and neighboring Mount Kisco that night.
9265	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A Mount Kisco police officer has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in Perez's death.
9266	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say the officer drove the drunken Perez to Mount Kisco, dealt him a deadly blow to the abdomen and left him to die.
9267	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	In a later phone call to another Bedford sergeant, after Perez' death, a Bedford officer sings the title line from the 1966 hit record "Walk Away Renee" by The Left Banke.
9268	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Bedford Police Chief Chris Menzel defended the department, telling WCBS, "We are not callous or indifferent."
9269	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He said he could not comment further on the ongoing case.
9270	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America, said in a statement Friday that the incidents "show a clear indication that we have troubled and hateful police officers and bosses who clearly don't like Hispanic immigrants."
9271	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Mateo called for the suspension of the officers involved.
9272	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the Mount Kisco officer charged in the case, George Bubaris, did not immediately return a telephone call late Thursday.
9273	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The lawyer, Edward Hayes, has subpoenaed all Bedford police records about Perez.
9274	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors have called the subpoenas improper and are trying to quash them
9275	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	a hearing is set for next week.
9276	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez, 42, an illegal immigrant, had a history of making drunken calls to the police emergency dispatcher.
9277	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He called Mount Kisco police complaining of stomach pain on April 28, and police records show Bubaris reported there was no need for further action.
9278	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits filed on behalf of Perez' family maintain that Mount Kisco and Bedford made a practice of "dumping" each other's undesirables in the neighboring town.
9279	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Bedford police had taken Perez into Mount Kisco hours before Bubaris allegedly took him to Bedford.
9280	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Through a translator, Perez' brother, Anival Perez, called the Bedford officers' taped conversations "unrespectful."
9281	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Bubaris, who said he is engaged to a woman of Puerto Rican heritage, has said he is deeply troubled by implications that he was racially insensitive

9285	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-01-25 19:14:55 UTC
9286	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Mary-Kate Olsen calls Heath Ledger a "friend" in a brief statement released Friday, the first word from the "Full House" star since the Australian-born actor's death.
9287	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Released by her publicist, the statement, in its entirety, reads:
9288	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	"Heath was a friend.
9289	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	His death is a tragic loss.
9290	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	My thoughts are with his family during this very difficult time."
9291	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police said the masseuse who found Ledger's body Tuesday spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialing the police-fire emergency dispatcher for help.
9292	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	The masseuse called Olsen a fourth time after paramedics arrived.
9293	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	At some point during the frenzy, Olsen, who was in California, summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help, police said.
9294	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police told The Associated Press on Friday that they do not want to interview the actress in connection with the calls.
9295	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Olsen's whereabouts were unknown Friday.
9296	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	A private viewing was scheduled for Friday at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan, and Ledger's family was flying to the U.S. from his native Australia.

9321	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	US auto industry expects weak January sales as a tough year begins
9322	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	DETROIT 2008-01-30 21:10:01 UTC
9323	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The year automakers have been dreading has begun.
9324	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts forecast U.S. sales could fall by as many as 1 million vehicles in January compared to the same month last year, bearing out predictions that 2008 could be the worst year for automakers in more than a decade.
9325	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers report January sales on Friday.
9326	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Car sales were remarkably slow in January, probably in part because of dramatic stock market fluctuations that flustered consumers at a time when the housing market and other economic uncertainties were also making headlines," said Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry analysis at the auto information site Edmunds.com.
9327	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toprak and others predict January sales will be down 3 percent and that few automakers will escape unscathed.
9328	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	January sales are normally lower after the holiday rush in December.
9329	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	But analysts say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when automakers introduce new products and the election brings political uncertainty to an end.
9330	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, buyers are skittish.
9331	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy in January than they had been in December.
9332	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The group said most of the 5,000 U.S. households surveyed expect business conditions and employment to deteriorate further in the months ahead.
9333	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts say that will have a direct affect on the auto industry.
9334	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Our sense is macroeconomic pressures, particularly deteriorating consumer confidence and gas 'permanently' above $3 a gallon, will increasingly catch up with consumers throughout 2008, weighing on demand for durable goods," Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said in a recent note to investors.
9335	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
9336	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said that while consumers can take comfort in the fact that gas prices seem to be stabilizing, they are still scared off by the weak labor market.
9337	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Barry predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993.
9338	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Other analysts forecast higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales will likely fall below 16 million.
9339	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers sold 16.3 million vehicles in 2007.
9340	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit sales to rental-car fleets.
9341	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Ford reduced rental fleet sales by 32 percent in 2007 and has vowed to make more -- although less aggressive -- cuts in 2007.
9342	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	GM cut fleet sales by 15 percent and plans more cuts this year, while Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press said earlier this month that rental fleet sales propped up 2007 results but would be cut this year.
9343	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the line on incentive spending.
9344	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers have been trying to rely less on costly incentives, and Nesvold said the level of December spending -- an average of $2,746 (euro1,854) per vehicle industrywide -- was down from a year earlier.
9345	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Still, December spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to shore up the market with incentives.
9346	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	That trend could get worse before it gets better.
9347	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	GM and Toyota Motor Corp., already locked in a battle in the full-size pickup market, could pile on more incentives to hold onto their share as Ford and Chrysler introduce new pickups this fall.
9348	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toyota and GM were already putting nearly $3,000 (euro2,026) per vehicle on their new full-size trucks in 2007.
9349	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toprak said Honda Motor Co. is one of the few automakers who could buck the trend in January.
9350	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Honda's sales were strong in the last few months of 2007 thanks to its Honda Fit subcompact and redesigned Honda Accord sedan, and that could carry into 2008 as consumers look for more fuel-efficient cars.

9352	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA 2008-01-31 00:16:23 UTC
9353	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Former President Jimmy Carter said he hoped this week's meeting of Baptists across racial and theological lines could inspire other churches to end their internal divisions.
9354	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	"If we can do it, maybe all other Christians can do it as well," Carter said Wednesday at the start of the gathering.
9355	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	More than 10,000 participants are expected over three days.
9356	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Carter and other Baptist leaders organized the meeting, "Celebration of a New Baptist Covenant," to develop common ministries and to challenge any perception that all Baptists accept conservative Southern Baptist views.
9357	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	The former president, a longtime Bible teacher at his Plains, Georgia, church, insisted that the meeting was strictly religious, not political.
9358	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	It is being held just days before Feb. 5, when more than24 states will hold presidential primaries or caucuses.
9359	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Former Vice President Al Gore and former President Bill Clinton are among the keynote speakers.
9360	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, at a separate meeting of four major black Baptist groups, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke about their candidacies.
9361	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	The black Baptists ended their meeting early so they could join the Carter-led event, which critics have dismissed as little more than a Democratic rally.
9362	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	The Rev. William Shaw, president of the National Baptist Convention USA Inc., the largest of the four black Baptist denominations, said "this time was set without any reference to the political calendar."
9363	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Carter and many others at the Atlanta gathering were once active in the Southern Baptist Convention but severed ties with its leaders after conservatives took control in a long, bitter and very public fight in the 1970s and 1980s.
9364	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Carter said Wednesday that he has been communicating with the current Southern Baptist president, the Rev. Frank Page, who has said that he "assured President Carter of my prayers" for the meeting despite some doubts about its purpose.
9365	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	With 16.3 million members, the Southern Baptist Convention is not only the largest U.S. Baptist group, but also the largest Protestant group in the country.
9366	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	The covenant meeting involves 30 Baptist groups from around the world.
9367	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	They span a range of theological and political beliefs.
9368	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Many oppose abortion and same-sex marriage and ordain only men.
9369	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	However, they also heavily emphasize Bible teaching on social justice, which will be a major focus of the gathering.
9370	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Northern and Southern Baptists split in 1845, when Northerners said they would not support missionaries who were slaveholders.
9371	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Black Baptists generally formed their own denominations and had their own splits over civil rights strategies and other issues.
9372	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Several speakers Wednesday invoked the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when describing why this meeting was so important.
9373	APW_ENG_20080131.0031.LDC2009T13	Bill Underwood, president of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, a sponsor of the event, said, "I think we are taking a step today on the long and difficult journey to one day achieving Dr. King's Dream."

9387	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2008-02-12 06:19:05 UTC
9388	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	Israel's housing minister said Tuesday that bids would go out soon to build 1,100 apartments in east Jerusalem -- a move sure to anger Palestinians, who claim the city's eastern sector as capital of a future state.
9389	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	Housing Minister Zeev Boim told Israel Radio that bids would go out soon to build 350 apartments in the Har Homa neighborhood and an additional 750 in Pisgat Zeev.
9390	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	The announcement two months ago that Israel would build more apartments in Har Homa soured peace talks with the Palestinians even before they began.
9391	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	Israel annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Mideast war, and does not consider construction there to be settlement activity, as the Palestinians and international community do.

9393	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	HANOI, Vietnam 2008-02-14 03:23:51 UTC
9394	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed a man in northern Vietnam in the country's second death from the illness this year, and health officials warned Thursday that the virus could spread further.
9395	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The 40-year-old man from Hai Duong province died Wednesday, six days after being admitted to the national tropical disease hospital in the capital, Hanoi, said Nguyen Huy Nga, director of the Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine Department.
9396	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The man's test results came back positive Sunday for the dangerous H5N1 virus strain.
9397	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	He was the 49th person to die of the virus in Vietnam since bird flu began raging across Asia in late 2003.
9398	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	H5N1 killed a 32-year-old man in northern Tuyen Quang province in January.
9399	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Nga said the latest victim developed flu symptoms on Feb. 2 and was admitted to the Hanoi hospital Feb. 10.
9400	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	"The danger of the bird flu virus spreading further remains very high," Nga said "We have repeatedly urged people to report sick poultry to animal health authorities and to refrain from eating sick birds."
9401	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Dong Van Chuc, director of the Department of Animal Health in Hai Duong, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Hanoi, said nine of the man's 12 fighting cocks had died since late January.
9402	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Chuc said the man's wife cooked the dead chickens and shared them with a relative, then cremated the three sick birds, meaning that animal health officials could not test any of their flock for the bird flu virus.
9403	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	No members of the man's family have fallen ill, but health authorities were testing them and close neighbors for the virus, Chuc said.
9404	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu remains hard for people to catch, but health experts worry the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily among humans, sparking a pandemic.
9405	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	So far, most human cases have been linked to contact with infected birds.
9406	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The World Health Organization says at least 226 people have died worldwide from the virus.
9407	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	That number does not include the latest death in Vietnam.

9413	APW_ENG_20080217.0500.LDC2009T13	An independent state of Kosovo has yet to receive full international recognition, and its legal status remains an issue of controversy for many.
9414	APW_ENG_20080217.0500.LDC2009T13	However, in light of the decision of its parliament and government to separate from Serbia, the AP is using Kosovo as the most understandable geographic name for this specific region of former Yugoslavia.

9417	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	SEBASTOPOL, California 2008-02-26 00:05:57 UTC
9418	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California's big reds are coming on strong these days as winemakers pursue riper, fuller-flavored fruit.
9419	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	A number of wines have been creeping past 14 percent alcohol and even into the 15- to-16 percent range, as opposed to the tamer 12- to 13-percent of years past.
9420	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	This is largely because vintners wait longer to pick their grapes.
9421	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	More mature fruit is thought to make tastier wine, but it also means sugar levels have a chance to rise, which comes with the side effect of pumping up the alcohol volume.
9422	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Warmer harvests only increase the phenomenon.
9423	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
9424	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
9425	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Darrell Corti, president of Corti Brothers, a Sacramento wine and food market, is also in the less-is-more camp, announcing last year his store won't carry table wines over 14.5 percent alcohol.
9426	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Still, big reds, many of which are highly rated by critics, have their champions.
9427	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"They fill your mouth with flavor
9428	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	you can chew on them.
9429	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	They linger on your palate when you're drinking them and that's what Napa is known for -- its big, chewy cabs," said Doug White, director of operations for the Vintner's Collective, a Napa tasting room specializing in boutique wineries.
9430	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	For those who don't like the big wines, some have an issue with the style of higher-alcohol vintages while others are wary of the punch they can pack.
9431	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One definition of the "right" alcohol level is if two people can finish a bottle and "wish there was a little bit more," said Dunn.
9432	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.
9433	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You'd be lying on the floor."
9434	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	It's not always easy to tell just how much alcohol is in a wine.
9435	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
9436	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	When a percentage is listed it can be off by up to 1.5 percent, a tolerance granted because one batch of wine may differ from another, said Art Resnick, spokesman for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in Washington, D.C. Wines over 14 percent alcohol, which fall into a higher tax category, must list alcohol levels with a tolerance of plus or minus 1 percent.
9437	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
9438	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
9439	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One way to have ripe fruit without high alcohol is to use various technologies available to pull alcohol out of wine.
9440	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	But that's not something many winemakers want to talk about for fear of crushing the romantic vision of wine as an ancient art untainted by technology, said Clark Smith, co-owner and senior enologist of Vinovation, a company in the wine country town of Sebastopol that reduces alcohol levels through reverse osmosis.
9441	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The truth is that wine has already been affected by technology, from stainless steel tanks to sterile filtration, he said.
9442	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Unlike cooking, where chefs proudly show off new techniques made possible through innovation, winemaking's become more secretive, said Smith.
9443	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"It's a shame," he said, "because winemaking's just cooking."
9444	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Vinovation's process works by using powerful filters that remove alcohol and water from wine.
9445	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
9446	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
9447	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
9448	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the grower," he said.
9449	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	At Shafer Vineyards, a Napa Valley producer of highly rated reds, some coming in at 14.9 percent, winery president Doug Shafer won't use technology to reduce alcohol.
9450	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"We like our wines.
9451	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the fruit.
9452	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the richness," he said.
9453	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Shafer is aware of the debate over how much is too much, but says it's up to consumers to decide what style of wine they prefer.
9454	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling everything," he points out.
9455	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Industry wide, "the quality of wines from around the world just keep getting better and better," Shafer said.
9456	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think this is the golden age for the consumer."

9462	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	MANILA, Philippines 2008-02-27 12:32:12 UTC
9463	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Attacks on journalists in the Philippines are undermining press freedom and putting the country's democracy "under siege," the country's Supreme Court chief justice warned Wednesday.
9464	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Reporters also face harassment through abuse of defamation and libel laws, Chief Justice Reynato Puno said.
9465	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	"It is a dangerous time for those who report the truth," Puno said in a speech at an international conference in Manila on press freedom.
9466	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	"Democracy is all about the voice of the people," Puno said.
9467	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	"Democracy in this country is under siege because bullets fired at the direction of journalists pierce not only human flesh, but also our republican ideals."
9468	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Since 1986, when democracy was restored after dictator Ferdinand Marcos' ouster in a "people power" revolt, 70 journalists have been killed in the Philippines, according to the Manila-based Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, one of the organizers of the conference.
9469	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	The number of journalists murdered is the fifth-highest in the world, Puno said, citing 1992-2008 figures from the New York- based Committee to Protect Journalists.
9470	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Puno decried "censorship by killing" and the harassment of democracy advocates, especially journalists.
9471	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	"It is this enforced silence that we ought to break, for if there is anything that democracy can ill afford it is the sovereignty of the deaf and the dumb," he said.
9472	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Media and human rights groups have accused the administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of suppressing the press, citing most recently an incident in which two busloads of journalists who covered a failed coup on Nov. 29 were rounded up by police for several hours.
9473	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Officials said the journalists refused to leave the site of the attempted coup despite warnings and hampered police operations.
9474	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	Arroyo has denied accusations of media harassment, citing efforts by her government to stop the growing number of killings of journalists and left-wing activists.
9475	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	In October, the Justice Department ordered the speedy resolution of cases of human rights violations and killings allegedly committed by "agents of the state."
9476	APW_ENG_20080227.0701.LDC2009T13	The chief justice said only one of 33 cases filed in connection with the killings of journalists has been resolved.

9481	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	MEMPHIS, Tennessee 2008-02-29 05:13:16 UTC
9482	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Two FedEx jets got too close to each other on takeoff from the Memphis airport last week because of confusion over flight numbers for the planes, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said.
9483	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident, which the FAA classified as serious, air traffic control error, remained under investigation.
9484	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The air traffic controllers union blamed the incident and other recent mistakes by controllers at Memphis on short staffing and forced overtime.
9485	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman in Atlanta, disagreed Thursday.
9486	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"We have never found fatigue to be an issue in any of the errors that have occurred at Memphis," Bergen said.
9487	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	On Feb. 21, two FedEx jets flying in the same direction on takeoff came within 200 feet (60 meters) vertically and three- fourths of a mile (1.2 kilometers) horizontally to each other, Bergen said.
9488	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Big jets in the Memphis area are supposed to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) vertically and 3 miles (5 kilometers) horizontally.
9489	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"Those airplanes were extremely close together and that's just seconds away from the two of them hitting," said Ron Carpenter, local president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
9490	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
9491	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident began with the pilot of one plane getting on the wrong radio frequency "and accepting instructions intended for another aircraft," Bergen said.
9492	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.
9493	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"The controller didn't recognize the error on read-back," Bergen said.
9494	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.
9495	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The pilot's error was still under investigation.
9496	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FedEx declined comment, noting the investigation was ongoing.

9552	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Verdi ' s " La forza del destino " vocally wonderful, visually vibrant
9553	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Austria 2008-03-02 01:33:39 UTC
9554	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Giuseppe Verdi was worried about "all those dead bodies" in his "La forza del destino."
9555	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, there weren't enough for some in the audience.
9556	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	"Verdi's assassins," yelled someone in the audience after a particularly jarring scene.
9557	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	He and others booing the performance were clearly calling for the head of producer David Pountney and others responsible for the new production of "La forza" for savaging the Italian maestro with their all-too-free interpretation of his opera classic.
9558	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	True, some of the settings in this Vienna State Opera production were more "Stagecoach" than opera.
9559	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Lightly clad cowgirls hefting six-guns were stand-ins for the camp followers of the soldiers in the Verdi opera.
9560	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tableaux of military life were turned into grisly portraits of Hell with a touch of Bosch, mixed with T.S. Eliot.
9561	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And Pountney's skeptical view of religion made the final moments of the hero's reconciliation with God, Heaven and the death of his beloved Leonora a hard sell.
9562	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Adding to difficulties is that even without Pountney, this opera calls for an indulgent audience ready to accept a plot almost as cliche as the notion of "it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
9563	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Don Alvaro, the hero, is caught in the bedroom of Leonora by her father.
9564	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As he drops his pistol in submission it goes off, killing the elderly nobleman and setting into notion the "power of destiny" that ultimately leads to two more deaths
9565	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	that of Leonora's brother by the hero and of Leonora herself, killed by her brother literally as he expires from the sword wound inflicted by Alvaro.
9566	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Originally the hero himself was to commit suicide.
9567	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Perhaps fearful of the prospect of nobody left to take a curtain call, Verdi himself wrote co-librettist Maria Piave: "We need to think about the ending and find some way to avoid all those dead bodies."
9568	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	So in the version performed Saturday, Alvaro remains alive and redeemed, though deeply depressed.
9569	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that the audience was spared that condition Saturday was due less to the controversial production and more to the excellence of the musical performances both on stage and in the pit.
9570	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	No stranger to the score, conductor Zubin Mehta owned the music from the first throbbing chords of the overture to the "dying" notes of this performance.
9571	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Under his baton, the violin section sounded as if one powerful instrument.
9572	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His horns packed more oomph than any brass band.
9573	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And his woodwinds were tremulous, breathy and vulnerable, reflecting the pathos of the action under the spotlights.
9574	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His cues were perfect, his pauses powerful.
9575	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The principals also rose to the musical challenge.
9576	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Nina Stemme was a wonderful Leonora, with her Wagner-honed heroic soprano the perfect instrument for the vocal athletics called for by Verdi.
9577	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Her voice was fully rounded, powerful and evocative at all levels.
9578	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Complementing her sound was her excellent dramatic rendering of the heroine doomed by destiny.
9579	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Among her highlights on Saturday: "Madre pietosa Vergine."
9580	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	(Holy Mother hear my prayer.)
9581	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The sporadic boos mixed with the bravos for Salvatore Licitra were undeserved.
9582	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His warm and broad tenor was a lovely match for Stemme, making him a thoroughly enjoyable Alvaro.
9583	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	But the best male role of the evening was given by Carlos Alvarez.
9584	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As Don Carlo, Leonora's vengeful brother, his rich and vibrant baritone, coupled with a menacing and possessed stage presence, had all eyes and ears focused on him, at times even when he was not at center stage.
9585	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Also good: the choir, under Thomas Lang
9586	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Alastair Miles as Leonora's father and the father superior
9587	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tiziano Bracci as Melitone, the friar, and Nadia Krasteva as Preziosilla, the camp fortuneteller who in Pountney's version turns into a pistol- packing, hotpants-wearing Annie Oakley.
9588	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Saturday's performance was a mix of obsession, revenge, love and madness on stage
9589	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	hatred from some audience members incensed with the production, and redemption, as in the healing power of wonderful music on stage and in the pit.
9590	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	All in all, a powerful night at the opera.

9595	APW_ENG_20080302.0793.LDC2009T13	During Vladimir Putin's eight-year tenure, Russia's presidency has been a virtually unchallenged seat of power.
9596	APW_ENG_20080302.0793.LDC2009T13	As Dmitry Medvedev takes the mantle of head of state, however, the constitutionally enshrined balance between the presidency, the executive and the legislative could come under strain.

9629	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-03-04 20:42:34 UTC
9630	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Anna Nicole Smith's daughter will inherit the former Playboy model's estate, a judge ruled Tuesday.
9631	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Eighteen-month-old Dannielynn Hope was named sole heir by Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff, who also set up a trust in the girl's name.
9632	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Her father, Larry Birkhead, and Smith's executor, Harry K. Stern, will be co-trustees.
9633	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Beckloff granted a petition filed by Stern, who wanted to clarify Smith's intentions toward her daughter.
9634	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Smith drafted a will in 2001 -- five years before the child was born -- that left her estate to her then-only son, Daniel.
9635	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	However, it said the assets in Daniel's trust should be shared equally if she had future children.
9636	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Daniel was 20 when he died in 2006, three days after Dannielynn was born.
9637	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	"We and Mr. Stern always believed that Anna Nicole never intended to disinherit her daughter," Stern's lawyer, Bruce S. Ross, said after the hearing.
9638	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	"I'm pleased to say this chapter in the saga is closed."
9639	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Dannielynn could inherit millions of dollars if the estate wins an ongoing court fight over a will by Smith's wealthy second husband, J. Howard Marshall, that left much of his fortune to the model.

9642	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-03-06 04:52:42 UTC
9643	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Being shackled to a rock by your father as a 6-year-old in 98-degree heat might not be a part of a typical family vacation in the Bahamas -- but April Yvette Thompson didn't have a typical family.
9644	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In "Liberty City," a powerful and compelling new one-person show now on view at off-Broadway's New York Theatre Workshop, the magnetic Thompson takes us on a tour of her girlhood in the mostly black Miami neighborhood Liberty City.
9645	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Through a wonderfully varied cast of characters we are introduced to a singular clan -- and a singular period in history.
9646	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Thompson embodies each person completely and seamlessly transitions from one to another, thanks to sensitive direction by co-author Jessica Blank.
9647	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Never changing her casual clothes, she uses accents and mannerisms to portray her parents, her aunt Valerie, her adoptive grandmother Carolyn and herself.
9648	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The audience gets to know and care about each individual through Thompson's strong, specific characterizations.
9649	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Brought up in an activist household by a black mother and a Bahamian-Cuban father, young April grows up in the 1970s learning about African heroes, community involvement and the shameful legacy of slavery.
9650	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Her father, Saul, is a tenacious community organizer who serves on the city council and teaches April to stand up for herself and always speak her mind.
9651	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In Saul, there exists "the expectation of good," as his wife Lily says.
9652	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Despite his later failings, his fight for justice is the moral center of this production.
9653	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The revolutionary spirit binding Thompson's family begins to splinter when Saul is removed from the city council for demanding that corporate chains hire blacks in black neighborhoods.
9654	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	He starts an affair and moves in with his girlfriend.
9655	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Lily turns to a "cult church" and drags April along to knock on doors on Saturday mornings.
9656	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	April's fractured family mirrors the fragmentation of the neighborhood caused by a lack of jobs and the prevalence of crack.
9657	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The simmering resentment boils over into the Miami riots of 1980 -- sparked by a not guilty verdict for four white policeman accused of beating Arthur McDuffie, a black man, to death.
9658	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	These riots seem all the more terrifying as seen through April's 11 -year-old eyes as she struggles to get herself and her brother home from school through streets filled with chaos.
9659	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Antje Ellerman's evocative set includes Carolyn's kitchen, Saul and Lily's living room and a tiny piece of Valerie's condo, with a backdrop of chain link fence.
9660	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Behind all this is the Brotherhood Supermarket, complete with a painting of Martin Luther King.
9661	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	We also get a tiny sliver of beach with a rusted shackle.
9662	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Above the stage are wide screens for Tal Yarden's projections of Liberty City skylines, archival footage of the riots and the ocean surrounding the rocky island of Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.
9663	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In that last location, Saul is teaching April about her ancestors.

9668	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	NIAMEY, Niger 2008-03-10 23:14:10 UTC
9669	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Tuareg rebels in Niger released 25 soldiers who were taken hostage nine months ago in the country's troubled northern desert, the government said on Monday.
9670	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Their release comes just days after Tuareg rebels in Mali, Niger's neighbor, released 22 hostages last week -- the last of about 40 soldiers and government officials taken prisoner in August raids.
9671	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The hostages released Monday were flown to Niamey, Niger's capital, on a Libyan plane, suggesting the role that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi played in the negotiation.
9672	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	In neighboring Mali, the government thanked Gadhafi for "his brotherly work" in ending the crisis.
9673	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Abouba Albade, Niger's Minister of the Interior and Security, held a ceremony at the airport to welcome home the 25 hostages.
9674	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He, too, thanked a foundation set up by Gadhafi for the men's release.
9675	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The Tuaregs, the light-skinned nomads that have made a home out of the Sahara desert, have long been at odds with the darker- skinned rulers of the band of countries cutting across their native sand dunes -- especially in Mali and Niger.
9676	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The latest spate of hostage takings began last year following a resurgence of hostilities between the ethnic Tuareg rebels and the government of the two countries.
9677	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Gadhafi, Libya's leader, has long been rumored to be providing logistical support to the rebels.
9678	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Albade said that Niger "wanted to reiterate the gratitude it feels toward the Gadhafi foundation for its good work."
9679	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	But the minister rejected the possibility of a directly negotiating with the Niger Movement for Justice, known by its French acronym of MNJ, who grabbed the 25 hostages during a raid last June.
9680	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He said the government would only negotiate with these rebels once they put down their arms.
9681	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Six hostages remain in MNJ custody.

9691	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	DAMASCUS, Syria 2008-03-27 17:18:23 UTC
9692	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The Arab League is in dire financial straits because most of its 22 member states haven't paid all their annual contributions, said an internal report obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.
9693	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The League will hold its yearly summit this weekend in Damascus, and has listed a review of the financial situation high on its agenda, along with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Lebanon's presidential election standoff and the Iraqi crisis.
9694	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	According to the report prepared by Secretary General Amr Moussa, the League faces a US$22 million (euro13.94 million) deficit, or about 60 percent of its annual budget.
9695	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	Member states have paid only 86 percent of their contributions due for 2006 and 2007, said the report, stating that members owed US$88 million (euro55.75 million) in contribution arrears.
9696	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The League's annual budget runs at about US$36 million, with most of the contributions coming from oil-rich countries likes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
9697	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	But the report showed that some wealthy Gulf countries such as Qatar and Kuwait have reservations on their share of the budget --despite a boom in oil prices that has generated billions of dollars of additional revenues-- while poor nations like Somalia and Djibouti can't afford to pay their due.
9698	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	It ' s OK to skip mouth-to-mouth and do ' hands-only ' CPR for cardiac arrest in adults
9699	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-03-31 22:01:06 UTC
9700	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the chest to save a life.
9701	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives -- works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults.
9702	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Experts hope bystanders will now be more willing to jump in and help if they see someone suddenly collapse.
9703	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.
9704	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
9705	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
9706	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
9707	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.
9708	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used.
9709	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
9710	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.
9711	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But in either case, "Something is better than nothing," Sayre said.
9712	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
9713	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
9714	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	those "unable or unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
9715	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR.
9716	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.
9717	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Sayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now -- the next update was not due until 2010 -- because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR.
9718	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only will be added to CPR training.
9719	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
9720	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location.
9721	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving.
9722	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But less than a third of victims get this essential help.
9723	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Dr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was "dancing in the streets" over the heart association's change even though he does not think it goes far enough.
9724	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.
9725	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
9726	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
9727	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
9728	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.
9729	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's not only the yuck factor."
9730	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.
9731	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"They love it.
9732	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	It's less complicated and the outcomes are better," said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
9733	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	One person who's been spreading the word about hands-only CPR is Temecula, California, chiropractor Jared Hjelmstad, who helped save the life of a fellow health club member in Southern California
9734	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February.
9735	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in the meantime.
9736	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until paramedics arrived.
9737	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
9738	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.
9739	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine," said Hjelmstad.
9740	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was just fortunate enough to be there."
9741	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Goodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.
9742	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was lucky," he said.
9743	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Had the situation been reversed, "I wouldn't have known what to do."
9744	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's a second lease on life," he added.

9754	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	I don't know whether he was injured or not," he said.
9755	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	"The driver of the car told us that gunmen riding in a covered car have showered the aid workers' car with machine-gun fires, injuring the British man in the leg," added local clan leader Mohamed Marbuc Aden, who had met with the two men a day earlier.
9756	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	"They ordered Somalis in the car to alight and sped off with the two foreigners."
9757	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	The local commissioner of Buale town, Ibrahim Noleye, identified the two men as a Briton and Kenyan who worked in his region.
9758	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	He said they were seized as they traveled between Buale and Sikow in southern Somalia.
9759	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said the two workers seized in the incident do not work for the Rome-based agency, as earlier reports said, but were contractors for Genesys International Corp.

9762	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	"We are supporting any efforts to make sure they will be released," Northoff said in a telephone interview.
9763	APW_ENG_20080401.0928.LDC2009T13	The governor of the Middle Juba region, Hajir Bile Sugal, told The Associated Press that the government has dispatched soldiers to a village near Buale where he heard the gunmen had fled.

9771	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	A University of Washington professor says a recently discovered fish that crawls instead of swimming and has forward-looking eyes like humans could be part of an entirely unknown family of fishes.

9778	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	CHARLESTON, West Virginia 2008-04-03 17:27:38 UTC
9779	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Massey Energy Co.'s chief executive threatened to shoot an ABC News producer and tore his shirt collar when the newsman made an unannounced attempt to interview him in the coal company's parking lot, a network spokesman said Thursday.
9780	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	But CEO Don Blankenship said the scuffle happened after the producer put a camera too close to his face.
9781	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	ABC is working on a story about Blankenship's relationship with state Supreme Court Chief Justice Elliott "Spike" Maynard.
9782	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	The two were photographed vacationing in Monaco in July 2006 while Massey had cases pending before the court.
9783	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	The network plans to air footage next week that shows Blankenship telling the unidentified producer, "If you're going to start taking pictures of me, you're liable to get shot," ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said.
9784	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship then moved quickly toward the producer, grabbed his camera and snapped off a microphone before putting his hand's to the man's throat and tearing his shirt collar, Schneider said.
9785	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship offered a different version of events, saying the producer followed his Cadillac into the parking lot, got out, trained a camera on him and put it too close to his face.
9786	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	"I reached up and moved the camera aside a little bit and he took great offense," he said.
9787	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said the producer grabbed his arm and he grabbed the producer's chest to keep his balance.
9788	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said he moved the producer toward his car and repeatedly asked him to leave.
9789	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said he does not remember saying the producer might be shot, though he does not dispute that comment.
9790	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Schneider said the producer attempted the interview in the parking lot of Blankenship's office in eastern Kentucky after unsuccessful attempts to arrange a face to face meeting.
9791	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said ABC also interviewed Maynard and expects to run the story next week.
9792	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Neither side plans to press charges.

9796	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	HARARE, Zimbabwe 2008-04-03 23:04:35 UTC
9797	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Intruders ransacked offices of the main opposition party and police detained foreign journalists Thursday in an ominous sign that President Robert Mugabe might turn to intimidation and violence in trying to stave off an electoral threat to his 28-year rule.
9798	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Mugabe apparently launched his campaign for an expected run-off presidential ballot even before the official results of Saturday's election were announced, with state media portraying the opposition as divided and controlled by former colonial ruler Britain.
9799	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Five days after the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission still had not released results on the presidential election despite increasing international pressure, including from former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who recently mediated an end to Kenya's postelection violence.
9800	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition Movement for Democratic Change already asserted its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won the presidency outright, but said it was prepared to compete in any run-off.
9801	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The police raids came a day after official results showed Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower house.
9802	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission was slow on the 60 elected seats in the Senate, releasing the first returns late Thursday that gave five seats each to the opposition and ruling party.
9803	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai tried on Thursday to reassure security chiefs who vowed a week ago not to serve anyone but Mugabe, according to a source close to the opposition leader.
9804	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But an agreed meeting with seven generals was canceled when the officers said that they had been ordered not to attend and that they would be under surveillance, the source said.
9805	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The man, who requested anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity, gave The Associated Press a copy of a letter signed by Tsvangirai outlining "MDC guarantees to the uniformed forces of Zimbabwe."
9806	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was given to the generals earlier in the day, he said.
9807	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The letter promises generous retirement packages for those unwilling to serve an MDC government.
9808	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It also promises not to take back farms given to officers under Mugabe's land reform program, except in cases in which an officer got several farms or if land was being neglected.
9809	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was not clear who ordered the generals not to attend the meeting, but the fact that some senior officers apparently were willing to meet with Tsvangirai underlined reports of rifts within the highly politicized upper echelons of Zimbabwe's security forces.
9810	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to give security forces time to clamp down.
9811	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The law requires a run- off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in Harare said.
9812	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	A diplomat at the U.N. Security Council, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said if the run-off was put off the council might have to take up the issue.
9813	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti said hotel rooms used as offices by the opposition at a Harare hotel were ransacked by intruders he believed were either police or agents of the feared Central Intelligence Organization.
9814	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe has started a crackdown," Biti told The Associated Press.
9815	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"It is quite clear he has unleashed a war."
9816	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people ... including myself."
9817	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had canceled plans for a news conference.
9818	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai was arrested and severely beaten by police a year ago after a banned opposition rally.
9819	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	In a further signal of the government's hardening mood, heavily armed riot police surrounded and entered a Harare hotel housing foreign correspondents and took five away, lawyers said.
9820	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said Times correspondent Barry Bearak, a winner of a 2002 Pulitzer Prize, was among them.
9821	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The identities of the other reporters hadn't been determined.
9822	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists expressed alarm and called for the reporters' immediate release.
9823	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said two of the journalists were jailed and told they would be charged Friday with practicing journalism without licenses.
9824	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	She said the other three were released.
9825	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has ruled since his guerrilla army helped force an end to white minority rule and bring about an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, but his popularity has been battered by an economic freefall that followed the often-violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms in 2000.
9826	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign, the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
9827	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back to whites.
9828	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
9829	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and agricultural production has plunged.
9830	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain and other Western nations.
9831	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But Western sanctions involve only visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of his allies.
9832	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Independent election observers say their projections based on election results posted at a representative sample of local polling stations indicate Tsvangirai won the most votes in the presidential contest, but not enough to avoid a run-off.
9833	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old president.
9834	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and suppressing the opposition.
9835	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said Mugabe was ready for a run-off.
9836	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"President Mugabe is going to fight.
9837	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He is not going anywhere.
9838	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He has not lost," Matonga said on British Broadcasting Corp. "We are going to go hard and fight and get the majority required."
9839	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Reports said leaders of the ruling party scheduled a meeting Friday to discuss the run-off.
9840	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many meetings tomorrow," but declined details.
9841	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	International concern mounted about the continuing delays in releasing official election results.
9842	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We need to see an official tally, see it soon and have assurances made that this is actually a correct counting of the votes," U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
9843	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, said the delay was dangerous and urged officials "to declare the election results faithfully and accurately."
9844	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president," Annan said.
9845	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"I urge them to do the right thing ... The election results should be released now."
9846	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission said it was still receiving ballot boxes from the provinces, raising questions about where the votes had been.
9847	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition has charged Mugabe planned to rig the results, and Western election observers have accused him of stealing previous elections.
9848	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	According to official results, a total of 2,405,147 valid votes were cast in Saturday's parliamentary contests, supporting opposition charges that the voter roll of 5.9 million names had been hugely inflated with dead and fictitious people.

9861	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal audit of 18 beef slaughterhouses following the U.S.'s largest beef recall found humane handling violations in four of them, including one serious enough for the plant to be temporarily suspended.
9862	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the first attempt.
9863	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
9864	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	None of the plants was identified.
9865	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit, which covered slaughterhouses that supply beef to the National School Lunch Program and other federal food assistance programs, was requested by Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee.
9866	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on the beef recall Tuesday.
9867	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, the department recalled 143 million pounds of meat from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. in Chino, California, following an undercover video by the Humane Society of the United States that showed slaughterhouse workers abusing "downer" cattle -- those too sick or injured to stand.
9868	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use of electronic stunning prods

9870	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	and bunching up of cattle going into the stunning area.
9871	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for insufficient stunning.
9872	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter.
9873	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	While not a violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
9874	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The problems uncovered by the audit have been corrected, Schafer told Kohl at Tuesday's hearing.
9875	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added.
9876	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We have helped train our inspectors to observe while being unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
9877	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
9878	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	I am working with USDA to gather more information about these audits and to find ways to ensure that the problems being discovered do not continue."
9879	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer told reporters after the hearing that based on the audit's findings, he does not believe the problems at Westland/Hallmark were systemic.

9881	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"But our continuing investigation will give us the full answer to that."
9882	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, argued that the findings show there is a systemic problem.
9883	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.

9888	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California video released in January truly was an anomaly."

9893	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	Gilberto Silva came on as a substitute for Flamini on Tuesday and is likely to fill in for the French midfielder, who could be set to leave Arsenal when his contract expires at the end of the season.

9897	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	Lehmann said he didn't think Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was right to leave him out.
9898	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	"The results speak against it," he said.
9899	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	The 38-year-old Lehmann, who remains Germany's No. 1 goalkeeper, said he had decided to remain with Arsenal in the hope of winning the Champions League.
9900	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	"I saw a good chance (for me) to play.
9901	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	That I didn't get it makes me very angry," Lehmann said.
9902	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	Asked if he had been give a "fair chance" against Almunia, Lehmann replied: "No, I don't think so.
9903	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	If the coach had told me before the season, I could have decided if I wanted to sit on the bench or not."
9904	APW_ENG_20080410.1048.LDC2009T13	Lehmann said he might continue playing next season if he got to play in the Champions League again.

9970	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"In just the whole match I thought she played really well, and I just wasn't playing my game," Williams said.
9971	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I got caught a little bit on the defensive a lot and I wasn't doing anything I should have been doing."
9972	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Cornet, an 18-year-old ranked No. 40 in the world, also made the semifinals at Amelia Island last week.

9980	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"She gets a lot of balls back, and those kind of players are usually around for a good 20 years," Williams said.
9981	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams, who ousted No. 2 Maria Sharapova in Friday's quarterfinals, won her last two tournaments in Bangalore and Key Biscayne, and was 18-1 on the year.

9986	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In the third, Zvonareva again rallied in a match in which she took her chances far better.
9987	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Zvonareva converted seven of 10 break points, Dementieva only five of 22.

10608	APW_ENG_20080427.0817.LDC2009T13	Jordan Staal scored a power-play goal in the second period and Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury made 26 saves, giving the Penguins a 2-0 victory Sunday over New York Rangers and a home- ice sweep of the first two games of their second-round NHL playoff series.
10609	APW_ENG_20080427.0817.LDC2009T13	Staal's goal came with older brother Marc, a Rangers defenseman on the ice, and was all the offensive support Fleury needed.

10612	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Bavarian police seize collection of Latin American artifacts believed worth US$100 million
10613	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	MUNICH, Germany 2008-04-30 15:57:27 UTC
10614	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Munich police said Wednesday they have seized a large collection of Aztec, Incan and Mayan cultural artifacts that Costa Rican authorities say were illegally taken from their country.
10615	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Art theft specialists from Bavaria's criminal investigations office estimate that the collection, which includes around 1,100 masks, necklaces and statues, is worth about US$100 million (euro64 million), said Ludwig Waldinger, a spokesman for the office.
10616	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger said that Costa Rican authorities appealed to Germany and Interpol last week to help find a collection that they contend was removed from the country illegally by a 66-year-old art collector named Leonardo Augustus Patterson.
10617	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Patterson, a former diplomat from Costa Rica, claims to have proper ownership of the artifacts, investigators said.
10618	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	The collection includes pieces made by Native American craftsmen in El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru and Colombia in addition to Costa Rica.
10619	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger said that Patterson recently arranged for the collection to be shipped from Costa Rica to Europe.
10620	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	After clearing customs in Spain, the artifacts were loaded onto a caravan of semitrailers and driven to Munich.
10621	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Bavarian authorities found the collection packed in more than 100 wooden crates at an undisclosed location in Munich in southern Germany.
10622	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	They also found Patterson, who has been questioned by investigators but is not in police custody, said Waldinger.
10623	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	He could face criminal charges if it is determined that he is not the collection's rightful owner, Waldinger said.
10624	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger added that authorities want to unpack and catalog the art, but need to coordinate that effort with archaeologists and Latin American officials -- a process that could take up to a month.
10625	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Report: Deutsche Telekom CEO asks for patience from shareholders
10626	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2008-05-11 13:03:15 UTC
10627	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Telekom AG's chief executive has asked that shareholders show patience, pointing to the global credit crisis as a reason for the company's lackluster share price, according to an interview published Sunday.
10628	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Rene Obermann took over as head of Europe's biggest telecom company in late 2006.
10629	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Last week, the company reported a rise in first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.
10630	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Telekom shares, worth nearly euro13.50 when Obermann took over, closed at euro11.81 (US$18.29) on Friday.
10631	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"I want to show shareholders what great potential our company has
10632	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	and I want to make clear how great an effort we are making to increase the value of the company," Obermann was quoted as telling the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
10633	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	However, "I can't perform magic," he added.
10634	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"This is hard work that requires trust and patience."
10635	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann noted that Telekom shares performed strongly until January.
10636	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"Only with the credit crisis did the whole industry -- so our competitors as well -- fall back," he added, according to the report.
10637	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann said that his company's marketing of Apple's iPhone in Germany, where it is available only with a two-year contract from Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit, has been "attractive and profitable."
10638	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	He was quoted as saying that it has sold more than 100,000 of the devices in Germany so far.
10639	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann brushed aside a question as to whether Deutsche Telekom wants to buy U.S. mobile phone rival Sprint Nextel Corp.
10640	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"It is our general policy not to comment on such market rumors," he said.
10641	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"That would be irresponsible."
10642	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Judge says no to sister of Spanish princess seeking restraining order against media outlets
10643	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	MADRID, Spain 2008-05-15 15:12:18 UTC
10644	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The sister of Spanish Crown Princess Letizia, it seems, is a celebrity whether she likes it or not.
10645	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	A judge rejected a request from Telma Ortiz for a restraining order barring media outlets from filming her, arguing Thursday that she is a public figure despite her wishes.
10646	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz, 35, had argued she was not a celebrity and said news organizations have been harassing her and her companion, Enrique Martin Llop.
10647	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	This week she sued about 50 news outlets in a case being heard in the central city of Toledo.
10648	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The media organizations included major TV channels and gossip magazines like Hola!
10649	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But on Thursday Judge Maria Lourdes Perez Padilla said a restraining order would be "legally unviable" because Ortiz and Martin Llop are in the limelight, even if they claim otherwise.
10650	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The judge ordered them to pay undisclosed court costs.
10651	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz's problems with the Spanish gossip media began early this year when she returned from the Philippines, where she had been employed as an aid worker, to have a baby in Spain with Martin Llop.

10660	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-05-19 12:20:50 UTC
10661	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	India and Pakistan will hold peace talks Tuesday for the first time since Islamabad shifted from military rule, but the instability of the new civilian government could prove a hurdle to even modest progress, analysts said.
10662	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Bombings last week in the historic Indian city of Jaipur that killed 61 people will also shadow the meeting.
10663	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	India has accused Pakistan-based Islamic militants of involvement in past attacks.
10664	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Recent incidents in disputed Kashmir, including one Monday in which the Indian army said it lost a soldier due to firing from the Pakistani side, could also have an impact.
10665	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Regardless of the latest twists, South Asia's nuclear-armed neighbors want to keep talking.
10666	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Neither wants to revert to the hostility that has dogged relations for 60 years and led to three wars since the partition of the subcontinent on independence from Britain in 1947.
10667	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's new coalition government -- formed by parties that triumphed in February elections that dealt a heavy defeat to allies of President Pervez Musharraf -- says it wants to press on with the peace talks that Musharraf kickstarted in early 2004.
10668	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A breakthrough in the slow-moving dialogue appears unlikely -- not least because of a falling out within the coalition over how to restore judges fired last year by the former military strongman.
10669	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	That dispute has raised doubts over the government's survival.
10670	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"The new government is so fragile," said Moonis Ahmar, a Pakistani international affairs analyst.
10671	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"As long as the fragility is there, then it cannot make a decision."
10672	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	The negotiations between Pakistan and India are aimed at ultimately resolving their conflict over the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
10673	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	So far the talks have diminished the possibility of war, and fostered cultural and transportation links, but achieved little else.
10674	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	This week's session in Islamabad will review progress after the four rounds of wide-ranging talks held so far, said Mohammed Sadiq, spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry.
10675	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	First top civil servants will hold talks, then the two foreign ministers.
10676	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	The Pakistan state news agency reported Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee was also likely meet a host of other top Pakistani figures -- underscoring confusion over who is now calling the shots in Islamabad.
10677	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	The report suggested he would meet Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, Asif Ali Zardari, the chief of the main coalition party and seen as the power behind the prime minister, ex-premier Nawaz Sharif, chief of the junior coalition party, and Musharraf -- although after years of dominance, the president now appears a marginal figure.
10678	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Now "there is no focal point and the prime minister is just bogus," said Pakistani political analyst Talat Masood.
10679	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"He doesn't have the power and everyone is looking over the shoulder to Mr. Zardari or others to Nawaz Sharif."
10680	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Analysts say the talks could lead to easing of travel and visa restrictions but no headway is expected on core issues including the military confrontation in the high-altitude Siachen glacier area, and, of course, Kashmir.
10681	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Ashok Mehta, a strategic analyst in New Delhi, predicted little progress partly because India was uncertain if the new Pakistani government would continue Musharraf's policies.
10682	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Negotiators had reached a framework solution for Kashmir, but "India failed to capitalize due to lack of political will," Mehta said, adding that it's unclear if the same deal was still an option because officials in the new Pakistani government "don't want Musharraf's proposals on anything."
10683	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over Muslim-majority Kashmir, and Pakistan-based militant groups have been fighting there since 1989, seeking independence from predominantly Hindu India or a merger with Islamic Pakistan.
10684	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	On Monday, an Indian soldier died when an army post along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir came under fire from Pakistani territory, the Indian army said.
10685	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	It was the second alleged incident of firing across the frontier in the past week.
10686	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's military spokesman could not immediately be reached Monday but he has denied the previous incident.
10687	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Masood said the fact that talks are continuing is a good sign.
10688	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	He said it did not appear the Jaipur blasts would undermine them.
10689	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A previously unknown Islamic militant group calling itself the Indian Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility.
10690	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Indian media reports say police are also investigating a Bangladesh-based extremist group.
10691	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Even if concrete evidence emerged that Pakistani groups were involved, Masood said it was unlikely it would stop the peace process.
10692	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"I don't think they necessarily want to build up tension," he said.
10693	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"India is interested in economic growth.
10694	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	It is wiser to cooperate with Pakistan rather than making a fuss out of it."

10702	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The Israeli military said they hit militants who had just fired rockets into southern Israel.
10703	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The militant Hamas that controls Gaza said the wounded Wednesday were civilian bystanders.

10705	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Two Israeli civilians were killed in recent attacks in the past two weeks, and 14 were wounded last week when a rocket hit a mall in the southern city of Ashkelon.
10706	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Israeli airstrikes aimed to stop the rocket attacks have killed 14 Palestinians during that time.
10707	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Israel holds the Hamas militant group, which violently seized control of Gaza last June, responsible for all violence emanating from the area.
10708	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Hamas militants clash regularly with the Israeli military in Gaza and along its borders, and reject Israel's right to exist.
10709	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, Hamas said one of its members was killed on a "holy mission."
10710	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The term is used when a Hamas militant dies, either when mishandling explosives or in a premature explosion intended for an attack against Israel.

10713	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-05-22 04:04:26 UTC
10714	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The U.S. must be careful not to withdraw forces from Iraq too quickly because security gains could be lost, the country's top two war generals warn.
10715	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The position of Gen. David Petraeus, nominated to assume control of U.S. forces in the Middle East, and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, picked to replace Petraeus as the top commander in Iraq, all but guarantees that some 140,000 troops will be committed in Iraq for the remainder of the year.
10716	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The nominations, if approved by the Senate as expected, would keep the administration on its present course in Iraq and hand the next administration a pair of combat-tested commanders who have relentlessly defended President George W. Bush's decision last year to build up troop levels rather than wind down the war.
10717	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	"There is no simple metric or calculation that can give us a green or red light on further reductions," wrote Odierno in a lengthy question-and-answer document submitted to the panel in advance of a hearing scheduled Thursday before the Senate.
10718	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Various factors will be considered, but "I will rely most heavily on my subordinate commanders' recommendations and my own independent judgment," he added.
10719	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The two Army generals were set to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee, giving Democrats a chance to question them on when more troops might come home and whether the U.S. war effort in Iraq has aggravated the violence there.
10720	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Last year, both generals were integral to crafting and implementing Bush's new military strategy in Iraq, which included the deployment of 30,000 additional troops.
10721	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has recommended, and Bush has agreed, to withdraw the extra troops by July but to halt further reductions after that.
10722	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has said he needs a 45-day period of evaluation and then an indefinite period of assessment before he could recommend further pullouts.
10723	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	In his response to the committee, Petraeus reports that violence in Iraq last week was at its lowest levels in a month with trend lines indicating that security has improved.
10724	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	"Having noted that, progress is uneven and difficult challenges remain" including meddling by Iran and continued attacks by al- Qaida and sectarian militants, Petraeus wrote.
10725	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	But, he later added, "we have seen more unity across sectarian lines at the national level, and this presents opportunities for further progress."
10726	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus was picked to replace Navy Adm. William J. Fallon as chief of U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida.
10727	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The command's area of responsibility includes some of the most troubling hot spots: Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon, parts of Africa and Afghanistan.
10728	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Fallon resigned last month, saying news reports that he was at odds with the White House over Iran policy had become a distraction.
10729	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Odierno spent 15 months as Petraeus' top deputy before being nominated as the top commander in Iraq.

10779	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
10780	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a release Saturday that hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people had also been expelled from schools, monasteries and public buildings.

10783	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.

10785	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing."
10786	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	After his statement was reported, UNICEF issued a statement saying the remarks referred to "unconfirmed reports by relief workers on the relocation of displaced people affected by" the May 2-3 storm.
10787	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said the information came from a relief worker who had just returned from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he recounted his findings earlier in the day.
10788	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Separately, at a church in Yangon, more than 400 cyclone victims from a delta township, Labutta, were evicted Friday following orders from authorities a day earlier.
10789	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"It was a scene of sadness, despair and pain," said a church official at the Yangon Karen Baptist Home Missions in Yangon, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisal.
10790	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.
10791	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They have no home to go back to."
10792	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young children and those with severe illnesses left the church in eleven trucks Friday morning.
10793	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The authorities told church workers that the victims would first be taken to a government camp in Myaung Mya -- a mostly undamaged town in the Irrawaddy delta -- but it was not immediately clear when they would be resettled in their villages.
10794	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid groups meanwhile said Myanmar's military government was hindering foreign assistance for victims of the cyclone, despite a promise to U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon to ease travel restrictions.
10795	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.
10796	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They said the International Red Cross was waiting for permission to send 30 foreign staffers into the delta.
10797	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	An estimated 2.4 million people remain homeless and hungry after the May 2-3 cyclone hit Myanmar, also known as Burma.
10798	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's government says the cyclone killed 78,000 people and left another 56,000 missing.
10799	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations and then they are forced to move."
10800	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	But others were being denied such aid because they had lost their government identity cards, he said.
10801	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it was time for "reconstruction."
10802	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Foreign aid experts disagree, arguing that many people are still in need of emergency assistance for food and shelter, as well as medical care.
10803	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid workers who have reached some of the remote villages say little remains that could sustain the former residents.
10804	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Houses are destroyed, livestock have perished and food stocks have virtually run out.
10805	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Medicines are nonexistent.
10806	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The forced evictions are part of government efforts to demonstrate that the emergency relief period is over and that the affected population is capable of rebuilding their lives without foreign assistance," Human Rights Watch said.

10858	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	HAMILTON, Bermuda 2008-07-12 12:51:34 UTC
10859	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Hurricane Bertha was nearly stationary off Bermuda on Saturday but is still likely to create tropical storm conditions as it heads east of the Atlantic island, forecasters said.
10860	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Surfers and swimmers remained in the water under sunny skies on Friday despite reports of stronger surf and rip currents along the southern coast.
10861	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	"I'm not concerned at all," said John Wilson, a native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who was vacationing in the capital of the wealthy British territory.
10862	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	"If you're going to be on an island during a hurricane, the best thing is to be in a hotel with a nice minibar.
10863	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	And I'm on the second floor, so the waves won't hit me!"
10864	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Early Saturday, Bertha's center was about 220 miles (360 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda.
10865	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Forecasters said tropical storm conditions are possible on the island by late Saturday night.
10866	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bertha had maximum sustained winds of about 90 mph (150 kph) with some higher gusting.
10867	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm was barely moving but expected to chug north-northwest at about 5 mph (7 kph) later in the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
10868	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm is expected to pass well east of Bermuda, although any inclination toward the west would create stronger winds.
10869	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bermuda will likely receive up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain in the next two days.
10870	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	"We're on tropical storm watch, but not hurricane watch and that's a plus," said 47-year-old Joanne Cook from New Jersey.
10871	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	"I'll take that."
10872	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	She said Bertha had only brought bothersome things like large amounts of jellyfish and lionfish.
10873	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bertha became the Atlantic season's first hurricane on July 7 and has vacillated between a Category 1 and 2 storm.
10874	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The first named storm this year, Arthur, formed in the Atlantic the day before the season officially started June 1 and soaked the Yucatan Peninsula.
10875	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Police pose as pedestrians to nab motorists who fail to yield
10876	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	CHICAGO 2008-07-16 18:53:38 UTC
10877	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	So why did officer Grace Delgado try to cross the road?
10878	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	To remind motorists that they must stop whenever someone steps off the curb into a crosswalk.
10879	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In an unusual undercover operation, Delgado posed as a pedestrian on a busy street while fellow officers waited for drivers to barrel past her in violation of a law that requires them yield at crosswalks, even if there is no stop sign.
10880	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Chicago this year joined a growing number of big cities and small towns that are sending officers into traffic to make motorists pay more attention to pedestrians.
10881	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"People, they don't care," said Delgado, whose bright pink baseball hat and orange blouse made her especially tough to miss.
10882	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It's 'Get out of my way.'
10883	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The whole mentality is 'Get out of my way.'"
10884	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	With Delgado's help, police stopped 78 vehicles in just two hours and told them they'd violated a law that's been on the books for years.
10885	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	That number easily could have been doubled, but officers stopped only drivers who kept moving after Delgado had walked four or five feet into the road.
10886	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	When they were pulled over, motorists offered all kinds of explanations: One saw the pedestrian in the crosswalk but hadn't heard about the law requiring him to stop.
10887	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Another knew about the law but didn't see the pedestrian.
10888	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,800 pedestrians were killed and 61,000 injured in 2006, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
10889	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago alone, 65 pedestrians have died annually in recent years.
10890	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The number of deaths has dropped, but there is concern those numbers could climb again as more vehicles hit the road, and the elderly population skyrockets.
10891	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"We're beginning to see a healthy desire of older folks to remain active and go out for their daily walks," said Doug Hecox, spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration.
10892	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"That, along with more cars ... is a recipe for danger."
10893	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Some communities already are seeing more walkers because of the slow economy.
10894	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"The way gas prices are, people are rediscovering their feet," said Pam Fischer, highway traffic safety director in New Jersey, which recently launched a "Cops in the Crosswalks" program.
10895	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the law, then sent relieved drivers on their way.
10896	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	But police understand that the only thing more effective than a lecture from a police officer is a lecture and a ticket.
10897	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"If there's really no threat of getting a ticket for it, you're not going to really pay attention," said officer Chuck Trendle, who was working with Delgado.
10898	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Essex County, New Jersey, authorities "tried the educational route for years," said Paul Loriquet, spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
10899	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"But until you hit somebody in the wallet, it doesn't stick."
10900	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The threat of a ticket seemed to work in Bellingham, Washington.
10901	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	After the city started a police-decoy program in 2002, the percentage of drivers who yielded to pedestrians rose at least 25 percent -- even at corners where tickets were not being issued.
10902	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In St. Petersburg, Florida, the results were even more impressive.
10903	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The percentage of motorists who yielded to pedestrians jumped from 2 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2007, after police began writing tickets, educating the public and installing flashing beacons.
10904	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Pedestrian crashes dropped 17 percent between 2005 and 2006.
10905	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It starts putting pedestrians on their radar," said Ron Van Houten, a Western Michigan University psychology professor who has studied pedestrian safety and trained officers around the nation, including Chicago.
10906	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Police say undercover pedestrians will focus attention on crosswalk safety the same way that giving tickets for seat belt violations convinced more people to buckle up in the 1980s.
10907	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"Eventually, people get it," Trendle said.
10908	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Hurricanes Fausto off Mexico, Bertha off New England pose no threat to land
10909	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	MEXICO CITY 2008-07-19 21:56:48 UTC
10910	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Hurricane Fausto strengthened Saturday far off Mexico's Pacific coast, while Hurricane Bertha hovered over the Atlantic hundreds of miles (kilometers) off the coast of New England.
10911	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said neither storm is expected to threaten land.
10912	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Tropical Storm Cristobal meanwhile formed off the southeastern United States, sending bands of rain into Georgia and the Carolinas.
10913	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	It is the first storm to threaten the U.S. this hurricane season, the center said.
10914	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	In the Pacific, Hurricane Fausto had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph).
10915	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	It was centered was about 460 miles (735 kilometers) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, and was moving northwest at 8 mph (13 kph).
10916	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Bertha remained a Category 1 hurricane and raced through the Atlantic with winds near 75 mph (120 kph).
10917	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	It was located about 490 miles (790 kilometers) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and was moving northeast at 25 mph (41kph).
10918	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Bertha battered Bermuda earlier this week, knocking out electricity to thousands at the Atlantic tourist destination.
10919	APW_ENG_20080719.0770.LDC2009T13	Bertha is the longest-lived July tropical storm in history, but was expected to weaken in coming days, the hurricane center said.
10920	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	BLACKBURN, England 2008-07-21 14:48:57 UTC
10921	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	Blackburn chairman John Williams said two offers to buy David Bentley have failed to meet his valuation of the England winger.
10922	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	Bids by Tottenham and Aston Villa for the 23-year-old Bentley were rejected, but even if an attractive offer is made, manager Paul Ince will be left to decide whether to accept it.
10923	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	"We have received two bids but neither have come anywhere close to our valuation which is based in line with how we see the market," Williams said Monday.
10924	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	"We don't want to lose David, but if we do get a bid that meets our valuation then ultimately it comes down to a football decision by Paul.
10925	APW_ENG_20080721.0754.LDC2009T13	"David is one year into a four-year contract, but he told us when (manager) Mark Hughes was here that he wanted a move so this doesn't come as a shock to us."

10927	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan says 2Q sales grow, MS drug to become US$1 billion `blockbuster ' soon
10928	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	DUBLIN, Ireland 2008-07-24 18:42:40 UTC
10929	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp.
10930	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	PLC. reported narrowing second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
10931	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Revenues rose 30 percent to US$245.6 million (euro156.6 million) in the April-June quarter, chiefly because of Tysabri, which is produced and distributed in alliance with U.S. drugmaker Biogen Idec Inc.
10932	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan cut its losses nearly in half to US$71.5 million (euro45.6 million), compared to a US$141.1 million loss in the second quarter of 2007.
10933	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Executives said they hoped to report narrower full-year losses and a 2009 return to profit -- which would be Elan's first since the company nearly went bankrupt amid an accounting scandal in 2002.
10934	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The fate of Ireland's largest pharmaceutical company rests with Tysabri, which appears finally on the verge of attaining Elan's ambition of a "blockbuster" drug that exceeds US$1 billion (the equivalent of euro650,000) in annual sales.
10935	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
10936	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke said Elan hoped to reach 100,000 Tysabri customers by the end of 2010, while current projections pointed to 90,000.
10937	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	It's a strong turnaround from 2005, when Elan faced potential financial ruin over the surprise withdrawal of Tysabri.
10938	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Three clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called PML, and two died.
10939	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
10940	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.
10941	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The three PML victims were simultaneously taking another MS-fighting drug
10942	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.
10943	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The further we go (without any new PML cases), the more comfortable that people become and the more that patients demand to be put on Tysabri," Cooke said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
10944	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
10945	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He said close to 7 percent were already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20 percent would be.
10946	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
10947	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He downplayed the restrictions placed on Tysabri's use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators, noting that specialist clinics do have leeway to prescribe the drug as a first resort and were increasingly doing so.
10948	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the drug today.
10949	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan's spending on research and development increased 36 percent to US$81.2 million (euro51.8 million), chiefly reflecting efforts to produce treatments and a potential cure for the brain- destroying Alzheimer's disease.
10950	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan and its research partner, Wyeth, plan to present second- phase results for one potential Alzheimer's treatment, bapineuzumab, at a Chicago conference for neurologists Tuesday.
10951	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical trials.
10952	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan Chief Executive Kelly Martin said the company had spent 15 years researching to combat Alzheimer's, which afflicts an estimated 15 million people worldwide, a figure expected to double at least within the next decade.
10953	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The Alzheimer's need is, unfortunately, immense," Martin said.
10954	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"It is probably the largest single market that's as yet untapped by the biopharmaceutical industry."
10955	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan has been the star performer on the Irish Stock Exchange over the past year, rising nearly 40 percent during a period when the overall Dublin market has lost half its value.
10956	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan shares suffered their biggest drop in seven months Thursday, closing down 8.8 percent at euro20.12 (US$31.49).
10957	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, wider market losses and analyst concerns that next week's Alzheimer's data might deliver mixed news.

10962	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2008-07-25 12:39:34 UTC
10963	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The England and Wales Cricket Board will decide next week whether the English team will compete in the Champions Trophy due to ongoing concerns over the security situation in Pakistan.
10964	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The International Cricket Council confirmed Pakistan as the host on Thursday, but the ECB will make a final decision on Aug. 4 with the participation of Australia and New Zealand also in doubt.
10965	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"The ECB takes it own security advice," chief executive David Collier said Friday.
10966	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Our board will be considering that on August 4, so we will have a look at that.
10967	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	There were concerns expressed not only by the ECB, but also by CA (Australia), CSA (South Africa), NZC (New Zealand).
10968	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It's a very fluid situation in Pakistan at the moment.
10969	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It's primarily the external environment we're looking at and which we have raised some concerns over.
10970	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	We will be monitoring that very closely."
10971	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Collier said England's players would be consulted before any decision is taken.
10972	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're in very close touch with the PCA (Professional Cricketers Association)," he said.
10973	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Clearly, other boards around the world are in the same position.
10974	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The safety and security of our players is paramount and we won't compromise on that."
10975	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	PCA chief executive Sean Morris said England's players did have some misgivings about playing.
10976	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We've still got some very serious concerns, despite the fact that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have made every effort they can to try to make it as safe as possible," Morris said.
10977	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"But, unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyone's control."
10978	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf tried to reassure participating nations by noting the security at last month's Asia Cup.
10979	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"The security firm of the ICC gave us (an) 'A' grade in the arrangements made during the Asia Cup," he said, adding that Pakistan is a "safe country to play cricket in."
10980	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Ashraf's stance was backed by ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat.
10981	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Our security advisers are very confident," Lorgat said.
10982	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We know of no credible threat against the event or any players.
10983	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The Asia Cup was held recently and there were no incidents.
10984	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It was a pretty safe event."
10985	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Yet concerns remain.
10986	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Australian Cricketers Association chief Paul Marsh said a boycott was possible.
10987	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There are many players, not just in Australia but all around the world, that are not comfortable with going to Pakistan at this time," Marsh said.
10988	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"So, the sad part about all of this is that the Champions Trophy looks like it's going to disintegrate into a second-rate event, unfortunately."
10989	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	New Zealand Players' Association head Heath Mills said touring Pakistan had met with unanimous disapproval from his players.
10990	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There isn't one player I have spoken to who is comfortable about traveling to Pakistan at the moment," Mills said.
10991	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"From what we've seen from the various security reports compiled prior to the meeting in Dubai, there is no way you could consider Pakistan a safe workplace.
10992	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're not in a position where we can compromise on this issue.
10993	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	If we compromise on player safety for commercial considerations or politics, then in my view we might as well pack up our bags and go home."

10998	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	Meteorologists said more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in the mountainous area, and flash flood watches were in effect for central and eastern New Mexico.

11001	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	A police helicopter was sent to rescue people reported to be standing on buildings and vehicles, state Department of Public Safety spokesman Peter Olson said.

11010	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-07-28 08:17:29 UTC
11011	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	Some 5,000 employees of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Germany's largest airline, walked off the job Monday to begin a strike for higher wages, the ver.di union said.
11012	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	Ground crews in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich and several other cities were taking part in the stoppage, union spokesman Erhard Ott said on ZDF television.
11013	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	Still, Lufthansa said that initial effects of the walkout were minimal.
11014	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	"So far, all flights are on time," airline spokesman Klaus Walther told ZDF.
11015	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	Ott said, however, that the goal was not to affect customers with "as many canceled flights as possible, but to hit the airline."
11016	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	Ver.di, which represents some 52,000 Lufthansa workers, said Friday that nearly 91 percent of its members voted for an open- ended strike.
11017	APW_ENG_20080728.0268.LDC2009T13	The union had sought a pay rise of 9.8 percent this year, and rejected a Lufthansa offer of 6.7 percent spread through February 2010, plus a one-time bonus payment.

11020	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
11021	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
11022	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.
11023	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee already had said the warning did not affect Hamm's spot on the team for the Beijing Games.
11024	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG's announcement came a day after Hamm's twin brother, Paul, withdrew from the Olympics, saying he won't be healthy enough to defend his all-around title.
11025	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Paul Hamm had a broken right hand and strained left rotator cuff.
11026	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle.
11027	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	After being notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
11028	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USADA said it had "absolutely no concern" the shot was for anything but medicinal purposes.
11029	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	As part of his punishment, Hamm's results from the second day of nationals were wiped out.
11030	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm would still have made the team.

11033	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa began cancelling the first international long-haul flights on Wednesday as ground and cabin crew continued their strike at Germany's biggest airline for a third day, the company said.
11034	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it canceled round trips to New York, Dallas, Chicago, Calgary, Calcutta and Dubai.
11035	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The rest of the 82 flights canceled Wednesday were for destinations in Germany and Europe.
11036	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Spokeswoman Amelie Lorenz said the canceled flights accounted for about 4 percent of the airline's total flight capacity.
11037	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	She said affected passengers were being put on flights operated by other airlines.
11038	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The airline said it had drawn up a special schedule for German and European routes for the next five days that calls for about 90 percent of flights to take off.
11039	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	It said a similar plan for intercontinental flights will follow soon.
11040	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said the cost of the strike was not yet clear.
11041	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"There are not yet measurable effects of possible further strike actions and cost burdens from the ongoing negotiations," Mayrhuber said, speaking at the company's release of second- quarter earnings Wednesday.
11042	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Stephan Gemkow was brief but frank on the subject, admitting: "It's expensive."
11043	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The ver.di union, which represents about 50,000 ground service personnel and a small number of cabin staff, started an open- ended strike for more pay Monday.
11044	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The first day of strikes had little effect on the Cologne-based airline's flights, but approximately 70 flights were canceled Tuesday.
11045	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The union is seeking a 9.8 percent pay rise for a year, while the airline has offered 7.7 percent for 21 months including a one- time bonus payment.
11046	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Gemkow said the union and airline were not in discussions currently.
11047	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The union isn't ready to talk to us at the moment," he said.
11048	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	A top official with the Federation of German Industries urged ver.di to "show moderation and return to the negotiating table."
11049	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The strike is damaging air transport, tourism, logistics and the whole economy -- and that in a phase in which economic signals are in any case pointing downward," Werner Schnappauf said in a statement.
11050	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Harald Walter, a ver.di spokesman, said the union was compiling a cost estimate of what Lufthansa could be encountering through the strikes.
11051	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	He said that, for instance, both Lufthansa Technik, the company's aircraft maintenance and repair business, and catering unit LSG SkyChefs usually do a lot of work for airlines other than Lufthansa, but that extra revenue was not coming in from outside customers during the strike.
11052	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa Cargo spokesman Nils Haupt said cargo operations also were affected and freight to many German and European destinations was being transported by truck instead of by air.
11053	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Haupt said the cargo division was doing its best to compensate for the strike by using different internal personnel, including some from outside Germany, as well as other service companies.
11054	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa shares closed down nearly 1.5 percent at euro14.88 (US$23.36) in Frankfurt.

11059	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Country music star John Rich wants like-minded voters to join him in "Raising McCain."
11060	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The other half of the Nashville duo Big and Rich, the singer- songwriter has penned lyrics for a rock-infused anthem focused on the 5 1/2 years Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his refusal of an early release.
11061	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He stayed strong, stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out.
11062	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Now we've got a real man with an American plan, we're going to put him in the big White House," the song says.
11063	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Its refrain: "We're all just raising McCain" -- a play on the phrase "raising Cain" that refers to causing trouble.
11064	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich, 34, planned to debut "Raising McCain" on Friday at the Country First concert in Panama City, Florida, with McCain on hand.
11065	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	In an interview, Rich said he hadn't been involved in politics before but got excited about the Arizona senator's campaign.
11066	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	He finished the song about a month ago and sent it to McCain's daughter Meghan, who sent it onto campaign officials.
11067	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"I wanted to offer him something that he didn't have, a rally song, one that really captures that maverick spirit," Rich said.
11068	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich said McCain's Vietnam experience motivated him to compose the song, which he planned to offer on his Web site without charge.
11069	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"This guy is a hero," Rich said.
11070	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He was physically tortured for years, and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades."
11071	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas composed a song for Obama, "Yes We Can," and enlisted celebrities like actress Scarlett Johansson and singer John Legend to perform and sing.
11072	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The song became an online sensation, drawing more than 8 million hits on YouTube alone.
11073	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich said that while he admired Obama and was "proud as an American" that a black candidate was on the verge of winning the Democratic nomination, he disagreed with the Illinois senator on most major issues and felt he didn't have enough experience to be president.
11074	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"The entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us," Rich said.
11075	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"National security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues.
11076	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us safe."

11080	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	Malaysia to set retail gasoline price once a month
11081	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2008-08-01 11:00:29 UTC
11082	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	Malaysia's government will set a new retail price for gasoline once a month starting Sept. 1, the prime minister said Friday, in an apparent bid to curb public frustrations over soaring inflation.
11083	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in a statement that the figure will be calculated based on the average international price for a barrel of crude oil each month.
11084	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	He did not elaborate on what pricing system or exchange would be used to calculate the crude price.
11085	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The government will provide a public subsidy of 30 sen (9 cents) per liter of gasoline to keep the retail price lower than the market rate, Abdullah also said.
11086	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	He added that the pump price would not exceed the current 2.70 ringgit (US$0.83) per liter for the rest of this year.
11087	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The new mechanism comes after the government hiked gasoline prices by 41 percent in June to curb a runaway subsidy bill.
11088	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The increase caused year-on-year inflation to spiral to 7.7 percent that month -- the steepest rate in more than 27 years.
11089	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	Abdullah noted that crude oil prices have shown a recent "downward trend," indicating that the government expects to lower retail gasoline prices by next month.
11090	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	Subsidies have kept the price of fuel in Malaysia -- a net exporter of oil -- among the lowest in Southeast Asia.
11091	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	But the government has said it cannot afford to fund overly high subsidies.

11093	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	ALGIERS, Algeria 2008-08-03 10:19:49 UTC
11094	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	A blast near a police station in northern Algeria early Sunday wounded 21 people, including six police officers, the Interior Ministry said.
11095	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The explosion occurred in Tizi-Ouzou, a northern city about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the capital, Algiers, the ministry said in a statement that gave no further details.
11096	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said, however, that the explosion appeared to have come from a van.
11097	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but the country's al-Qaida affiliate -- al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa -- has said it was behind most recent bombings.
11098	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The group, formerly known as the GSPC, grew out of an insurgency in the 1990s.
11099	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The violence, which left as many as 200,000 dead, was prompted by the army's cancellation of 1992 legislative elections that an Islamist party was poised to win.
11100	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The number of attacks had diminished before rising again dramatically after the GSPC in 2006 reaffirmed allegiance to al-Qaida.
11101	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Many attacks in Algeria have targeted the national security services and military, while others have struck foreigners.
11102	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	A double suicide bombing in December in Algiers killed 41 people, including 17 U.N. workers.
11103	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	In April 2007, coordinated suicide strikes against the main government offices in central Algiers and a police station killed 33.
11104	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Tizi-Ouzou and surrounding areas are frequent sites of clashes between extremists and security forces.

11106	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	ATHENS, Greece 2008-08-04 12:12:14 UTC
11107	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	A 31-year-old Greek man accused of beheading his girlfriend with a cleaver is in critical condition after being shot by police, Health Ministry officials said Monday.
11108	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Police said restaurant cook Thanassis Arvanitis severed the head of his 25-year-old girlfriend Sunday on the holiday island of Santorini.
11109	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Arvanitis agreed to surrender to police officers, then attacked one officer with the cleaver and escaped in a patrol car, police said in a statement.
11110	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	He was shot three times by police while trying to flee.
11111	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Three female bystanders were also injured in the clash in Bourboulos, near the island's main town of Fira.
11112	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	A 21-year-old Greek female tourist was hit by a ricocheting police bullet, while the suspect crashed into an oncoming motorbike, injuring two female doctors, both aged 26.
11113	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Arvanitis and the three bystanders were being treated in a state hospital in Athens.
11114	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The two doctors were making a good recovery after suffering leg injuries, said Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos.
11115	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The tourist was in stable condition.
11116	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The injured policeman received treatment for facial wounds on Santorini.
11117	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Following an argument, "the (suspect) slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman ... totally severing her head," a statement from the South Aegean Police Department said.
11118	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	"The attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other."
11119	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to believe that people like this circulate among us," said Santorini Mayor Angelos Roussos.
11120	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	11 charged in connection with credit card fraud
11121	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	BOSTON 2008-08-06 01:22:35 UTC
11122	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Eleven people, including a U.S. Secret Service informant, have been charged in connection with the hacking of nine major retailers and the theft and sale of more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
11123	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The data breach is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which said the suspects were charged with conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft.
11124	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Three of those charged are U.S. citizens while the others are from places such as Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus and China.
11125	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The indictment returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston alleges that the suspects hacked into the wireless computer networks of retailers including TJX Cos., BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp
11126	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW and set up programs that captured card numbers, passwords and account information.
11127	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"They used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data, which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves," Attorney General Michael Mukasey said at a news conference.
11128	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"And in total, they caused widespread losses by banks, retailers, and consumers."
11129	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Mukasey called the total dollar amount of the alleged theft "impossible to quantify at this point."
11130	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said that while most of the victims were in the United States, officials still haven't identified all the people who had a card number stolen.
11131	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised," he said.
11132	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Sullivan said the alleged thieves weren't computer geniuses, just opportunists who used a technique called "wardriving," which involved cruising through different areas with a laptop and looking for accessible wireless Internet signals.
11133	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Once they located a vulnerable network, they installed so-called "sniffer programs" that captured credit and debit card numbers as they moved through a retailer's processing networks.
11134	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The information was stored on two servers in Ukraine and Latvia -- one with more than 25 million credit and debit card numbers and another with more than 16 million numbers, Sullivan said.
11135	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The heist was a black eye for retailers like TJX.
11136	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The company initially disclosed the data breach in January 2007 but said a few months later that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to possible fraud in a breach of its computer systems that began in July 2005.
11137	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Court filings by some banks that sued TJX put the number of cards affected at more than 100 million, based on estimates by officials with Visa and MasterCard, who were deposed in the suit.
11138	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, TJX said it won support from MasterCard-issuing banks for a settlement that will pay them as much as $24 million to cover costs from the breach.
11139	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A similar agreement reached last November with Visa-card issuing banks set aside as much as $40.9 million to help banks cover costs including replacing customers' payment cards and covering fraudulent charges.
11140	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	According to the indictments unsealed Tuesday, three of the defendants are U.S. citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from China and one is from Belarus.
11141	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	One individual is known only by an alias online, and his place of origin is unknown.
11142	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	At a press briefing in San Jose, California, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the non-U.S. citizens under indictment were part of an international stolen credit and debit card ring.
11143	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The ring operated in mainly in Eastern Europe, the Phillipines, China and Thailand, and the alleged foreign conspirators remained outside the U.S., Chertoff said.
11144	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The thefts were criminal actions committed for the personal gain of the defendants, who investigators did not consider a national security threat, Chertoff said.
11145	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, their alleged crimes demonstrated the weaknesses of cybersecurity in the U.S.
11146	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Today's indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every American faces in the 21st century -- the fact that each individual's greatest asset is their names, their identity," Chertoff said.
11147	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In the Boston indictment, the alleged ringleader Albert "Segvec" Gonzalez of Miami was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy.
11148	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez, who is in custody in New York, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all the charges.
11149	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez was a U.S. Secret Service informant who helped the agency take over a Web site being used to transmit stolen identifiers and stolen credit card numbers, U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said at the news conference.
11150	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"That was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped," he said.
11151	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	But he said the Secret Service later found out that Gonzalez had also been feeding criminals information about ongoing investigations -- even warning off at least one person.
11152	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, we weren't happy that a person working for us as an informant was double-dealing," Mark Sullivan said.
11153	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments were also unsealed Tuesday in San Diego against Maksym "Maksik" Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr "Jonny Hell" Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia.
11154	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	They are charged with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data.
11155	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Yastremskiy was arrested when he traveled to Turkey on vacation in July 2007.
11156	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is facing related Turkish charges, and U.S. officials said they have requested his extradition.
11157	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Justice Department officials said Suvorov was arrested on the San Diego charges by German officials in March when he traveled there on vacation.
11158	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is in custody awaiting the resolution of extradition proceedings.
11159	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments against Hung-Ming Chiu and Zhi Zhi Wang, both of China, and a person known only by the online nickname "Delpiero" were also unsealed in San Diego.
11160	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A Justice Department spokeswoman said those three suspects, together with five others, are still at large.
11161	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Officials did not give an arraignment date for Gonzalez.
11162	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Yastremskiy, Suvorov and Gonzalez on 27 counts of fraud and identity theft.
11163	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The charges stemmed from allegations that they hacked into a national restaurant chain's computerized cash registers and stole credit card information from customers.

11165	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Buster's restaurants around the United States suffered at least $600,000 in losses, prosecutors said.

11173	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile the 15-nation euro dropped to $1.5420 from $1.5473 after going as low as $1.5396, and the British pound sank to $1.9475 from $1.9562 ahead of interest-rate decisions by the European Central Bank and Bank of England Thursday.
11174	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar gained as gloomy economic signs came in from abroad.
11175	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Japanese government said a monthly index of business conditions was worsening, setting off the yen decline, said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
11176	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the German government said industrial orders dropped unexpectedly in June, with orders from elsewhere in Europe leading a decline that underlined pessimism about the outlook for the continent's biggest economy.
11177	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Orders dropped 2.9 percent in June, following a 1.4 percent drop in May, the Economy Ministry said.
11178	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Ashraf Laidi, a currency strategist at CMC Markets, said the decline, the seventh in a row, along with a leaked report by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung claiming that German second-quarter GDP likely shrunk by 1 percent, would weigh on the European Central Bank at its Thursday meeting.
11179	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"The hawkish rancor of (ECB President) Jean-Claude Trichet is likely going to be toned down considerably," Woolfolk said.
11180	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Rate- hike talk will be cast aside, and Britain may signal future rate cuts, he said.
11181	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"The ECB and Bank of England don't have much to cheer about."
11182	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The ECB is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25 percent, given the 4.1 percent inflation in the 15-nation euro zone, while the BoE is expected to keep its rate steady as well, at 5 percent.
11183	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve left the benchmark U.S. federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday.
11184	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Before rising inflation forced a pause in June, the Fed had cut rates seven times since the fall in hopes of reviving the flagging U.S. economy.
11185	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Talk of the Fed hiking rates had driven the dollar higher over the past three weeks, but Tuesday's announcement hinted that a weak economy was still a risk, and many analysts talked down the chance of a rate hike.
11186	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Higher interest rates abroad can push down the dollar, as investors transfer their funds from American assets to overseas, where they can get higher returns on their investments.
11187	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, oil futures touched below $118 a barrel Wednesday, while gold dropped below $880 an ounce.
11188	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Commodity-exporting countries whose currencies were buoyed as long as commodities shot higher, such as Canada and Australia, have seen the value of their dollars eroded.
11189	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar rose to 1.0477 Canadian dollars from 1.0428, circling year highs.
11190	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Australian dollar, meanwhile, fell to its lowest point in more than four months, to 90.62 U.S. cents.
11191	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	In other New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.0602 Swiss francs from 1.0539 francs.
11192	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"It is not simply a dollar rally but a sell-off in the Europeans," said Woolfolk.

11194	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	BEIJING 2008-08-10 16:19:01 UTC
11195	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	A Christian activist was detained Sunday while bicycling to a church service in the Chinese capital attended by U.S. President George W. Bush, who emerged later extolling religious freedoms before continuing with his Olympics visit.
11196	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Also Sunday, five Tibet activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, were taken away by security agents after protesting near Tiananmen Square, the latest in a series of small, short-lived attempts by demonstrators to use the games to showcase their causes.
11197	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hours before, Hua Huilin said he and his brother, Hua Huiqi, a housing activist and member of Beijing's underground Christian church, were stopped by two black cars while bicycling to Kuan Jie Protestant Church around dawn.
11198	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huilin said they were taken away in separate cars by security agents, whom his brother recognized from previous encounters.
11199	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua said they took away his brother's Bible and cell phone.
11200	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	He was released in the afternoon but Hua Huiqi was still at an undisclosed location, he said.
11201	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"I told him not to go because it's during the Olympic Games and this period is sensitive," Hua Huilin told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
11202	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"But he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized.
11203	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	So I went with him hoping to protect him."
11204	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The line was disconnected three times during Hua's conversation, a sign that authorities were monitoring the telephone.
11205	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huiqi had been planning for days to be at the church at the same time as Bush, but it was not immediately clear what he was going to do.
11206	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	A man who answered the telephone at the Beijing Public Security Bureau's spokesman's office said they would try to find out what happened.
11207	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	He would not comment otherwise or give his name, as is common with Chinese officials.
11208	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	China allows worship only in officially approved churches such as the one Bush visited Sunday with first lady Laura Bush, so millions of people pray privately in house churches to avoid detection.
11209	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	After attending the service, Bush gathered for photos with parishioners on the front steps.
11210	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"It just goes to show that God is universal," Bush said.
11211	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"No state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion" -- a reference to China's tight control of churches.
11212	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	It was not clear if Bush was aware of Hua's situation.
11213	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	In the Tibet protest, Padma-Dolma Fielitz, a 21-year-old Tibetan, and another activist held the Himalayan region's national flag aloft just outside the south entrance of Tiananmen Square, according to a statement by Students for a Free Tibet.
11214	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Photos on the group's Web site show a woman identified as Padma- Dolma being dragged on the ground as police and plainclothes agents try to wrest the flag away from her.
11215	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Shortly after, three other activists tried to unveil a banner that said "Tibetans are dying for freedom" but were stopped by authorities, the group said.
11216	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	All five protesters -- including two Americans and two Canadians -- belong to the New York-based group.
11217	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Later Sunday, John Hocevar, a member of the activist group who videotaped the protest, told AP Television News that Chinese officials had escorted the group onto a plane bound for the United States.
11218	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Many Tibetans insist their region was an independent nation before Chinese Communist troops invaded in 1950, while Beijing says it has been part of its territory for centuries.
11219	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Pro-Tibet activists say China is using the Olympics to legitimize its rule in Tibet.
11220	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The demonstration lasted about five minutes and all five were led away, the group said.
11221	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	It was the latest in string of similar protests in the past week as Beijing became a focus of international attention because of the games, which opened Friday.
11222	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Chinese authorities often round up activists before and during sensitive periods, taking them to detention centers and other faraway locations.
11223	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	They have already further tightened normally stringent restrictions to curb potential criticism or protests during the Olympics.
11224	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, a human rights group said an activist whose husband was jailed earlier this year has disappeared and may have been taken by police to prevent her from speaking to journalists during the games.
11225	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said Zeng Jinyan disappeared on Thursday and has not been heard from since.
11226	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Zeng is married to activist Hu Jia, who was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison in April for "inciting state subversion."
11227	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The Communist government routinely uses the vague charge to imprison dissidents for years.
11228	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huiqi, an underground pastor who has fought against a development project in his neighborhood, has been arrested and beaten several times over the last few years because of his religious activities and has served six months in jail for "obstructing official business."
11229	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups say that charge stemmed from an incident in which Hua and his mother scuffled with police as they prepared to deliver a petition to the central government over the demolition of their home in 2001.

11233	APW_ENG_20080812.0924.LDC2009T13	Red and white Georgian flags fluttered over the crowd in central Tbilsi, which filled a square and nearby streets as far as the eye could see.
11234	APW_ENG_20080812.0924.LDC2009T13	People held posters saying "I love Georgia" and "I love you Misha" -- the familiar form of the president's first name.
11235	APW_ENG_20080812.0924.LDC2009T13	Deputy Prime Minister Gia Baramidze told the crowd they should hold their flags high and stand together, saying "we shouldn't be afraid of the enemy."

11288	APW_ENG_20080813.0002.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK -- Late September and early October are typically the best times to view fall foliage in the Northeast.

11314	APW_ENG_20080813.0002.LDC2009T13	HAVANA -- The money from abroad comes every few months, and after she divides it among fellow dissidents, there's usually only about $100 left for Laura Pollan.

11463	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks ago, authorities recovered another shank from his cell.
11464	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	His threats of violence kept prison officials from making him available for media interviews as his execution date approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome inmates.
11465	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	But prison officials said he offered no resistance as he was led to the death chamber.
11466	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said, calling him a "true psychopath."
11467	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery, when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video store in East Dallas where they worked.
11468	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after midnight to steal $392 from a cash register.
11469	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He shot the workers when Armstrong had difficulty opening a safe at gunpoint and Lindsey tried to run.
11470	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Most of the crime was recorded on security cameras in the store.
11471	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been the gunman.
11472	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Five months after the video store killings, Dorsey killed a 51 -year-old Korean woman, Hyon Suk Chon, at the convenience store she managed in Ennis, south of Dallas.
11473	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was in prison for that slaying when he was questioned again about the double slaying and confessed.
11474	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview from prison while he was awaiting trial.
11475	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I've done cut folks
11476	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've done stabbed folks
11477	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've killed folks," he told The Dallas Morning News.
11478	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"But it don't bother me."
11479	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey at age 12 moved to Waxahachie to live with his grandparents after he was booted from Germany where his mother was stationed in the Air Force.
11480	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Records show when he was 14 he took a gun to school and fired it.
11481	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	At 16, he fired at a couple driving in a car.
11482	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He'd walk down the street with a sawed-off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open -- just to see the reaction of people," Shook said.
11483	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's a piece of work."

11488	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	A Russian military convoy defied a cease-fire agreement and rolled through a strategically important city in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, which claimed fresh looting and bombing by the Russians and their allies.
11489	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush said a massive U.S. aid package was on the way for tens of thousands uprooted in the conflict and demanded that Russia "keep its word and act to end this crisis."
11490	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"The United States stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia be respected," Bush said sternly in Washington on Wednesday.
11491	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	One day after the Kremlin and its smaller neighbor agreed to a French-brokered cease-fire to end the dispute over two pro- Russian breakaway territories, the pact appeared fragile at best.
11492	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of Russian trucks and armored vehicles leaving the city of Gori, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the separatist region of South Ossetia and home of a key highway that divides Georgia in two, and moving deeper into Georgia.
11493	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Soldiers waved at journalists and one jokingly shouted, "Come with us, beauty, we're going to Tbilisi."
11494	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The convoy roared southeast, toward the Georgian capital, but then turned north and set up camp about an hour's drive away from it.
11495	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgian officials said the Russians had looted and bombed Gori before they left.
11496	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Moscow denied the accusation, but it appeared to be on a technicality: A BBC reporter in Gori said Russian tanks were in the streets while their South Ossetian allies seized cars, looted homes and set houses on fire.
11497	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	As confusion reigned on the first day of the cease-fire agreement, Bush called a Rose Garden speech to express concern about reports the Russians were already breaking it.
11498	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he was sending U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice first to France and then to Tbilisi to reinforce U.S. efforts to "rally the world in defense of a free Georgia."
11499	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	For her part, Rice said: "This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a neighbor, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with it.
11500	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Things have changed."
11501	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Bush said a huge U.S. aid effort was under way, including American naval forces and C-17 military cargo planes, to get clothes, blankets, medicine and other supplies to refugees.
11502	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The European Union agreed to consider deploying European peacekeeping monitors to the area.
11503	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides the hundreds killed since hostilities broke out last week, a United Nations agency estimates 100,000 Georgians may have been uprooted.
11504	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	A spokesman said the U.N. refugee agency was helping evacuate about 1,500 people fleeing the Kodori Gorge in the breakaway province of Abkhazia alone on Wednesday.
11505	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili conducted a blitz of interviews with news outlets at home and abroad and made a series of claims, some of which were disputed as inaccurate or exaggerated.
11506	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	He said on national television that the U.S. arrival of a military cargo plane with humanitarian aid "means that Georgia's ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S. Defense Department."
11507	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell stressed the United States had no plans to take over Georgian airports or seaports to deliver the aid.
11508	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have no designs on taking control of any Georgian facility."
11509	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	In a sharp response to Bush's speech, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called Georgia's leadership "a special project of the United States.
11510	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	And we understand that the United States is worried about its project."
11511	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russian news agencies quoted him saying the United States would have to choose "support for a virtual project" or "real partnership" on issues such as U.S.-Russian cooperation on Iran and other world tension spots.
11512	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said his country's military actions in Georgia were comparable to the U.S. response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.
11513	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"We just reacted because we didn't have any other option.
11514	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Any civilized country would act same way.
11515	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	I may remind you, September the 11th, the reaction was similar.
11516	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	American citizens were killed.
11517	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	You know the reaction," he said on BBC World News.
11518	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili criticized Western nations for failing to help Georgia, a U.S. ally that has been seeking NATO membership.
11519	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"In a way," he said, "Russians are fighting a proxy war with the West through us."
11520	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The conflict centers on South Ossetia and another region claimed by Georgia that leans Russian, Abkhazia.
11521	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	When Georgia cracked down on South Ossetia on Aug. 7, Russia sent its tanks and troops into the two regions and deeper into Georgia proper.
11522	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgia, bordering the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia, was ruled by Moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.
11523	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Abkhazia lies close to the heart of many Russians.
11524	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Its coast was a favorite vacation spot in Soviet times and the province is just down the coast from Sochi, the Russian resort that will host the 2014 Olympics.
11525	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russia has distributed passports to most people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and stationed peacekeepers there since the early 1990s.
11526	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgia wants the peacekeepers out, but Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has insisted they stay.
11527	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	In defiance, a few dozen Abkhazian fighters, some with assault rifles and one with a dagger, planted their red, white and green flag in Georgian territory across the Inguri River.
11528	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is Abkhazian land," one of them said.
11529	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Another laughed that Georgians retreating from Abkhazia had received "American training in running away."
11530	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The peace plan apparently would allow Georgian forces to return to the positions they held in South Ossetia and Abkhazia before Aug. 7 and clearly requires Russia to leave all parts of Georgia except South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
11531	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Georgian Security Council chief Alexander Lomaia said 50 Russian tanks entered Gori on Wednesday morning.
11532	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Some of the Russian units that later left to camp outside the city were camouflaged with foliage.
11533	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The convoy was mainly support vehicles, including ambulances, although there were a few heavy cannons.
11534	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	There were about 100 combat troops and another 100 medics, drivers and other support personnel.
11535	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	About 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the camp, about 80 well- equipped Georgian soldiers were forming what appeared to be a new front line, armed with pistols, shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets and Kalashnikovs.
11536	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Sporadic clashes continued in South Ossetia where Russians responded to Georgian snipers.
11537	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	In the Black Sea port of Poti, and Georgian television showed boats ablaze in the harbor.
11538	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgia's security chief said Russian forces targeted three Georgian boats -- but Lavrov said Russian troops were nowhere near the city.
11539	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	For several days, Russian troops held the western town of Zugdidi near Abkhazia, controlling the region's main highway.
11540	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	An AP reporter saw a convoy of 13 Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers in Zugdidi's outskirts Wednesday.
11541	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Later in the day, Georgian officials said the Russians pulled out of Zugdidi.
11542	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree Wednesday saying that Russian navy ships deployed to the Georgian coast will need authorization to return to the navy base Russia leases from Ukraine.
11543	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The rights group Human Rights Watch said it has witnessed South Ossetian fighters looting ethnic Georgians' houses and has recorded multiple accounts of Georgian militias intimidating ethnic Ossetians.
11544	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The report was important independent confirmation of the claims by each side in the Russia-Georgia conflict.

11578	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Tropical Storm Gustav surged toward hurricane force on Thursday as it drove toward Jamaica and aimed for the Cayman islands, prompting evacuations of tourists and offshore oil workers.

11582	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Its top sustained winds were just below hurricane strength at about 70 mph (110 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

11621	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 2008-09-02 16:43:18 UTC
11622	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The Tehran bureau chief for Al-Arabiya television has been banned by Iranian authorities from working in the Islamic Republic and was told on Tuesday to leave the country as soon as possible, the Saudi-owned network told The Associated Press.
11623	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The representative of the Dubai-based TV station spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue involving its reporter Hassan Fahas, based in Tehran since 2000.
11624	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The network's representative did not want to elaborate on how the decision of Iranian Information Ministry to revoke Fahas' press accreditation and declare him "persona non grata" will affect Al- Arabiya's news office in Iran, involving a staff of a dozen reporters, producers and cameramen.
11625	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	"It is not yet clear if they are deporting our bureau chief or closing our (Tehran) office," the Al-Arabiya representative said.
11626	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	"Either way, the message to the network is clear," he added.
11627	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	Iranian officials have long complained of Al-Arabiya's coverage of Iran as biased.
11628	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The network has rejected the criticism, saying that it had always given Iranian officials the chance to take part in its programs.
11629	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	Al-Arabiya opened its Tehran office in 2003.

11633	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Michael Moore to release new film online for free
11634	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-09-04 20:04:24 UTC
11635	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Inspired by Neil Young and Radiohead, Michael Moore will release his new film online and for free.
11636	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The film, "Slacker Uprising," follows Moore's 62-city tour during the 2004 election to rally young voters.
11637	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	It will be available for three weeks as a free download to North American residents, beginning Sept. 23.
11638	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	An official announcement of the film is planned for Friday.
11639	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore said he considered releasing "Slacker Uprising" theatrically as "Michael Moore's big election year movie" as he did with 2004's "Fahrenheit 9/11," which was highly critical of President Bush.
11640	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Instead, Moore opted for a symbol of gratitude to his fans as he approaches the 20th anniversary of his first film, 1989's "Roger &amp
11641	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Me."
11642	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate my 20th year of doing this," Moore said.
11643	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"And also help get out the vote for November.
11644	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	I've been thinking about what I want to do to help with the election this year."
11645	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The 97-minute long "Slacker Uprising" will be the first major film to be released in such a way.
11646	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Last December, "Jackass 2.5" was streamed online and for free, but that was only a collection of left over material from "Jackass 2."
11647	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Companies like ClickStar, which Morgan Freeman co-founded, have made films still in theaters -- such as 2006's "10 Items or Less" -- digitally available for purchase or rental.
11648	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Experimentation in distribution has been more common in the music industry, where the Internet has significantly damaged traditional business models.
11649	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore took notice when Radiohead last year released their seventh album, "In Rainbows," online with optional pricing.
11650	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	In 2006, Neil Young streamed his anti-war album "Living With War" for free before its standard release -- now a more common practice.
11651	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	If history is any measure, "Slacker Uprising" could have made a decent sum in theaters.
11652	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	His last two films, "Sicko" ($24 million) and "Fahrenheit 9/11" ($119 million) are two of the three highest grossing documentaries ever.
11653	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore said that "Slacker Uprising" cost about $2 million to make and that he will end up paying about $1 million out of his pocket.
11654	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Neither he nor the distributor, Brave New Films, plan to profit from the release.
11655	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The director's last film, "Sicko," leaked online and was downloaded illegally in large numbers.
11656	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	He says this download, offered by BlipTV, will be high-resolution and far better than "YouTube quality."
11657	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	To receive the download, people can sign up at SlackerUprising.com.
11658	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A "Night of a Thousand House Parties" is planned for Oct. 4, when local neighborhood screenings are hoped to be scheduled.
11659	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A DVD will be released Oct. 7.
11660	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore last week released a paperback book, "Mike's Election Guide 2008" and is currently working on a movie for theatrical release next year.
11661	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	That film is expected to examine America as an empire, but the director declined to discuss any details about it.
11662	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	For now, Moore hopes "Slacker Uprising" will help spur young people to vote this November.
11663	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	After more than 20 million 18 to 29 -year-olds cast ballots in 2004 (an 11 percent increase from 2000), he's hoping even greater numbers of "slackers" vote this year.
11664	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore readily acknowledges this a film for Democrats.
11665	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"This film, really isn't for anybody other than the choir," said Moore.
11666	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"But that's because I believe the choir needs a song to sing every now and then."

11671	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-09-05 00:12:14 UTC
11672	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Times may be tough in the real world.
11673	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Not in Hollywood.
11674	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	As it usually does during economic downturns, the movie business has come on strong, expected to set a summer revenue record of about $4.2 billion from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers.
11675	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	That would put Hollywood a fraction ahead of the previous record of $4.18 billion in summer 2007, though accounting for inflation, the actual number of tickets sold -- about 587 million -- is down 3.5 percent.
11676	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Still, given the sluggish economy, studio executives are happy their business held up so well.
11677	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	It's almost a tradition dating back to the Depression: When the economy goes sour, the escapism and relative cheapness of a night at the movies is an attractive prospect for audiences.
11678	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"Let's face it.
11679	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	It is truly one of the least-expensive ways to entertain yourself for a few hours," said Rory Bruer, head of distribution at Sony, whose summer releases included Will Smith's latest $200 million hit, "Hancock."
11680	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	The behemoth of summer was the Warner Bros.
11681	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman sequel "The Dark Knight," whose haul -- $500 million and counting -- amounted to nearly one-eighth of overall Hollywood revenues.
11682	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" passed "Star Wars" to rank No. 2 on the all- time domestic revenue chart, behind only "Titanic" at $600.8 million.
11683	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman mania already was high as production wrapped last fall, but it grew to a fever after Heath Ledger, who co-stars as the Joker, died in January.
11684	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"We would not be looking at a $4 billion summer if not for `The Dark Knight,'" said Paul Dergarabedian, Media By Numbers president.
11685	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"In this case, one film made a huge difference."
11686	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and four other superhero tales -- "Hancock," Paramount's "Iron Man," and Universal's "The Incredible Hulk" and "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" -- rang up $1.25 billion, 30 percent of the summer box office.
11687	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Add in the $315 million take for Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and it's clear that audiences were looking for pure adventure this summer.
11688	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	On the family front, the animated tales "WALL-E" from Disney and "Kung Fu Panda" from DreamWorks both topped $200 million.
11689	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	There was a healthy dose of chick flicks during the male-dominated summer with Warner's "Sex and the City" and Universal's "Mamma Mia!"
11690	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	-- both $100 million hits.
11691	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Raunchy comedy also packed in crowds with the R-rated hits "Tropic Thunder" from Paramount and "Step Brothers" and "Pineapple Express," both from Sony.
11692	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Some major flops accompanied the successes.
11693	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Eddie Murphy bombed with his sci-fi comedy "Meet Dave" from 20th Century Fox, as did Mike Myers with Paramount's comedy "The Love Guru."
11694	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Warner's family-action tale "Speed Racer" and 20th Century Fox's sci-fi sequel "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" also crashed and burned.
11695	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Yet most big studio films delivered, finding both commercial success and better-than-usual reaction from critics, who typically tear many summer blockbusters to shreds.
11696	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and "Iron Man" earned some of the best reviews ever for summer popcorn flicks, the acclaim helping to keep the theaters packed.

11699	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	LAGOS, Nigeria 2008-09-06 11:11:22 UTC
11700	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua returned to the West African country Saturday after more than two weeks in Saudi Arabia, where he reportedly spent a lengthy stint in a private hospital, officials said.
11701	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Information Minister John Odey told The Associated Press that Yar'Adua landed in Nigeria early Saturday and is "strong and well."
11702	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The opposition has demanded more disclosure on the state of Yar'Adua's health and Nigerian media reported that Yar'Adua spent much of his trip to Saudi Arabia in a hospital undergoing treatment for his chronic kidney condition.
11703	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	While Yar'Adua has long been known to suffer from a kidney ailment, government officials say he traveled to Islam's holiest land primarily as a pilgrim, although they say he has consulted with doctors during his 16-day trip there.
11704	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	But the political opposition has been pressing for more details.
11705	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The Nigerian media has reported that Yar'Adua's situation is more serious than the government has acknowledged, and that many members of Yar'Adua's family and political allies have traveled to Saudi Arabia to be with him.
11706	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	One major mass daily newspaper reported Friday that Yar'Adua may have undergone a kidney transplant.
11707	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Yar'Adua has made several lengthy trips to overseas medical clinics since he became governor of a northern Nigeria state in 2000.
11708	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	He also flew unannounced from the country in mid-2007, disappearing to Germany for days, just before April 2007 elections that he won.
11709	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Election observers condemned the vote as rigged and unrepresentative of the public will.
11710	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The government has insisted during Yar'Adua's trip to Saudi Arabia that he has been able to fulfill his presidential duties -- apparently trying to forestall challenges to his authority.
11711	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	If Yar'Adua were to leave power before his term ends in 2011, the official reins of government would be passed to Vice President Goodluck Jonathan.
11712	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	But under an informal agreement among Nigeria's business and political elite, presidential power should be rotated between Nigerians from the north and the south, the country's two main population blocs.
11713	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Yar'Adua's predecessor was a southerner, as is Jonathan, Yar'Adua's deputy.
11714	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Many fear that power passing again so soon to a southerner would raise fierce opposition from northerners, and potentially undermine the country's fragile political consensus.

11719	APW_ENG_20080907.0093.LDC2009T13	The shot was witnessed by several family members and verified by course owner John Bethard.

11725	APW_ENG_20080910.1242.LDC2009T13	Emre Belezoglu scored on a second-half penalty Wednesday to help Turkey earn a 1-1 draw against Belgium in a World Cup qualifier.
11726	APW_ENG_20080910.1242.LDC2009T13	FC Brugge's Wesley Sonck had given the visitors the lead in the 31st minute, heading a free kick past Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel into the top right corner of the net.
11727	APW_ENG_20080910.1242.LDC2009T13	That goal was a wake-up call for Turkey, and the European Championship semifinalists went on the attack for the rest of the first half, forcing several good saves from Belgium goalkeeper Stijn Stijnen.
11728	APW_ENG_20080910.1242.LDC2009T13	Turkey kept pressing relentlessly in the second half and the equalizer finally came in the 73rd minute, when Emre easily converted a penalty into the bottom right corner after a handball.

11739	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Sri Lankan authorities on Thursday ordered tens of thousands of ethnic Tamils living in Colombo to register with police a day after fierce fighting in the country's civil war killed 71 fighters, the military said.
11740	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The military also announced that naval forces destroyed a rebel boat off the coast during a sea battle Thursday, while downplaying reports that the rebels had attacked advancing troops with a chemical weapon.
11741	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	As the fighting intensified in recent months, the rebels have been blamed for a series of deadly attacks on buses, trains and other targets in the capital of Colombo and other towns that have killed scores of civilians far from the war zone.
11742	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities established a maze of roadblocks and checkpoints and continuously changed traffic patterns in Colombo in an effort to prevent new attacks.
11743	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	They have also required all residents of the north to register with the police upon their arrival in the city.
11744	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera announced Thursday that every Sri Lankan who came to Colombo from the north in the past five years would have to reregister with police en masse Sunday at police stations and other designated centers across the city.
11745	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The order will affect more than 100,000 people who came from the districts of Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaittivu, he said.
11746	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The overwhelming majority of those people are ethnic Tamils.
11747	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"We will not harass people, but we will request, 'Please come,'" Gunasekera said, adding that the exercise was simply an effort by authorities to update their records.
11748	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	He did not say what would happen to those who fail to register.
11749	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Ethnic Tamils living in the capital have complained of frequent police raids, harassment and arbitrary detentions as the fighting between government forces, dominated by the Sinhalese majority, and the Tamil Tigers escalated in recent years.
11750	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities, who hold wide-ranging security powers under emergency regulations renewed by Parliament each month, have long accused rebel sleeper agents of hiding amid Colombo's Tamil community.
11751	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Mano Ganesan, a Tamil lawmaker from Colombo, said there would not be enough time to register everyone in one day and few will be able to produce the required documents from government agents in their faraway home districts.
11752	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Those unable to register will likely be expelled from the city, he said.
11753	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"We will not allow it.
11754	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	We will fight against it, but that is their plan," he said.
11755	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	In new fighting Wednesday, soldiers killed 15 guerrillas in scattered battles in the Vavuniya district bordering the rebels' de facto state, the military said Thursday.
11756	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Other battles along the front lines killed five rebels and seven soldiers, the military said.
11757	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The government previously reported 40 rebels and four soldiers killed in other fighting Wednesday.
11758	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Much of the communication to northern Sri Lanka has been cut, and it was not possible to contact rebel officials for comment.
11759	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The military's figures could not be independently confirmed.
11760	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Each side commonly exaggerates its enemy's casualties and plays down its own.
11761	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	With the Tamil Tigers growing increasingly desperate in the face of a new government offensive, military officials said Thursday that some rebel fighters had attacked troops with CS gas, a form of tear gas.
11762	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said six troops were hit and hospitalized with minor breathing problems.
11763	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	However, a Special Forces soldier in the northern war zone told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a group of soldiers was killed by what appeared to be a burn agent loaded into a shoulder-fired rocket during a battle in the Kilinochchi district Monday.
11764	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The soldier, who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he had seen the bodies, and many were so badly disfigured they had to be buried in closed-caskets funerals.
11765	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Nanayakkara denied the account, saying that rebels had experimented with using chemical weapons, but had never employed them in battle.
11766	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"There was no burn agent," he said.
11767	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The rebels have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese majority.
11768	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people.

11770	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-09-18 11:13:23 UTC
11771	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	A trial has begun in the case of a baseball player-turned-actor accused of brutally killing a cat in a jealous rage after complaining that his ex-girlfriend cared more for the feline than she did for him.
11772	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Assistant District Attorney Leila Kermani said the cat named Norman died with broken teeth, broken ribs, a broken leg, a torn tongue, massive internal injuries including bruised lungs and a bruised liver and a chest cavity filled with blood.
11773	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant, in a fit of anger and rage, beat a defenseless animal to death," Kermani told the jury in her opening remarks Wednesday.
11774	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant killed Norman simply because he was an angry, jealous and drunken bully."
11775	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Former New York Mets baseball minor leaguer Joseph Petcka, 37, is on trial on charges of aggravated cruelty to animals for killing Norman on March 27, 2007, after a night of heavy drinking.
11776	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He faces up to two years in prison if convicted.
11777	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Petcka's lawyer, Charles Hochbaum, admitted his client kicked the 8-year-old tabby and "swatted him really hard" after the cat bit him, but he said his client did not mean to kill him.
11778	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"This was a tragic accident," Hochbaum said.
11779	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was not intentional."
11780	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum complained the district attorney's office never offered his client a plea deal.
11781	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He said outside court he believes that was because of the publicity the case attracted and the urgings of cat fanciers.
11782	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Norman's owner, Lisa Altobelli, testified she had dated Petcka about six weeks before he killed her cat.
11783	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said one night they quarreled and he began drinking heavily.
11784	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said she went to bed to avoid him but he woke her around 3 a.m. by putting his knee in her ribs and complaining that Norman had attacked him.
11785	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Altobelli, a Sports Illustrated reporter, said she left the apartment after Petcka refused to calm down.
11786	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said Petcka had complained, "You love that cat more than you love me," but she had no idea Norman would be in danger.
11787	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	When she returned home Norman did not meet her at the door as usual.
11788	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She found his body under her bedside table.
11789	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Petcka, a pitcher briefly in the Mets' minor league system in 1992, later appeared in a paper towel commercial and had small roles in "Sex and the City" and other television shows.
11790	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum said his client had more recently worked as a bartender and waiter.

11793	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has lashed out again at Israel, saying that the Jewish state won't survive in any form.
11794	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the hard-line leader smirked at a former mantra of the Israeli right of a "Greater" Israel that would include occupied Palestinian territories.
11795	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	The idea has since been abandoned, with Israeli consensus now that there will be a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
11796	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad said that while "some say the idea of Greater Israel has expired, I say the idea of a Lesser Israel has expired, too."

11799	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	GALVESTON, Texas 2008-09-18 18:15:34 UTC
11800	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The barrier island community of Galveston is not ready for residents to return even briefly to the city thrashed by Hurricane Ike, officials said Thursday as they pleaded for at least another week to make repairs.
11801	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Ike's death toll in the U.S. stood at 53, with 19 in Texas.
11802	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	In the Caribbean, Ike killed more than 80 people.
11803	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Many of the city's services -- including water, sewer and power -- are recovering but remain several days away from returning to full function, City Manager Steve LeBlanc said.
11804	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The only hospital on the island is getting some power, but not enough to care for the 60,000 residents of Galveston Island.
11805	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The extra strain placed on the city by the return of residents would only slow the recovery effort, LeBlanc said.
11806	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We don't have adequate water at this point for just taking a shower, flushing a toilet," he said.
11807	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We're not there yet."
11808	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Authorities let residents and business owners back onto the island briefly Tuesday to "look and leave," but quickly reversed course after the decision created traffic jams that backed up for miles Tuesday and Wednesday on Interstate 45, the only road onto the island.
11809	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Officials ruled out a resumption of that policy Thursday.
11810	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"It's more confusing," Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said.
11811	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We just want to bring everyone home, and we'll try to do it next week."
11812	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Thomas told residents that by waiting they were "making it possible for us to get you home in a week or so, instead of the months it would take if the city's infrastructure were more overwhelmed at this point."
11813	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Roughly 15,000 residents defied forecasters' warning of "certain death" to ride out the storm on the barrier island, and many remained there despite the repeated urgings of officials -- worried about threats that include mosquito-borne disease -- to get out.
11814	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are clear signs of life returning to Galveston.
11815	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Cell phone service had largely returned, and for the second day since the storm hit, a grocery store was open, though it wasn't selling meat or dairy items.
11816	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Galveston Police Chief Charles Wiley said since Ike hit, authorities have seen only 11 cases of looting -- a rate he called "phenomenally low."
11817	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are fears there are more victims yet to be found.

11839	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Protesters who defied Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip to bring aid to Palestinians last month are making a return voyage, a trip organizer said Tuesday.
11840	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Free Gaza organizer Greta Berlin said about 20 protesters will sail Wednesday from Cyprus aboard a boat named Hope for the 20-hour trip to the Palestinian territory.
11841	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Berlin said Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead McGuire, Palestinian Legislative Council member Mustafa Barghouti and an Italian opera tenor would be among the passengers.
11842	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	She said protesters would deliver a consignment of medicine and ferry Palestinians back to the east Mediterranean island on the return trip.
11843	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Israel had not decided whether or not to allow the boat into Gaza.
11844	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Palmor said he didn't know when a decision would be made, but that it was unlikely any decision would be announced in advance.
11845	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Protesters sailed to Gaza last month to protest Israel's yearlong blockade of Gaza imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas overran the territory.
11846	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	They hailed the trip as effectively ending the blockade.
11847	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Israeli officials had said the decision to allow the boats to reach Gaza and then to sail back to Cyprus was an attempt to deny the protesters a propaganda victory.
11848	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Finland ' s PM calls for stricter gun laws
11849	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	KAUHAJOKI, Finland 2008-09-24 12:29:04 UTC
11850	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Finland's prime minister called for stricter gun laws Wednesday as investigators revealed that the 22-year-old gunman focused his violence against women, killing eight female students and shooting another in the head.
11851	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The slaughter that left 10 people and the shooter dead Tuesday was Finland's second deadly school shooting in less than a year.
11852	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said it was time to consider restricting access to guns in a country with more than 1.6 million firearms in private hands.
11853	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We need to study if people should get access to handguns so freely," Vanhanen told reporters in Kauhajoki, 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Helsinki.
11854	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"I'm very, very critical about the guns and during next few months we will make a decision about it."
11855	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Finland has deeply held hunting traditions and ranks -- along with the United States -- in the top five nations in the world when it comes to civilian gun ownership.
11856	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The government also called Wednesday for an investigation into police handling of the case.
11857	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Police had questioned shooter Matti Saari, a student at the school, a day before the attack about YouTube clips showing him firing a handgun.
11858	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We will obviously investigate what the foundation was for the decision to let him keep his weapon," Vanhanen said.
11859	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	An anonymous tip Friday led police to search for Saari, but they released him after questioning Monday because police said they found no reason to keep him in custody.
11860	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Some of the YouTube clips appeared to have been shot by another person and police said they would question Saari's acquaintances to find out who that was.
11861	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	However, police said there was no indication that Saari had an accomplice during the shooting.
11862	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Solemnly leading his nation in a day of mourning, Vanhanen and other ministers visited Kauhajoki, a town of 14,000 people, as flags flew at half-staff.
11863	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Grieving residents placed candles and flowers outside the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality.
11864	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The National Bureau of Investigation said all the female victims were students, while the two men who were killed were a teacher and a student.
11865	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Saari also shot another female student in the head before shooting himself in the head.
11866	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	That 21-year-old woman had two operations overnight but doctors said she was in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
11867	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Investigators said most of the victims were from the Kauhajoki area, like Saari, meaning he probably knew them.
11868	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"He really went out with the intention of killing," investigation leader Jari Neulaniemi said.
11869	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"He left at home a message saying he wanted to murder as many people as possible.
11870	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	He tried to shoot fatal shots."
11871	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Police spokesman Urpo Lintula said Saari had acquired a permit for his weapon, a .22-caliber handgun, in August.
11872	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"With this weapon and plenty of ammunition, he came into the school yesterday morning and he also had a largish bag which apparently had flammable liquids or something to start fires," Lintula said.
11873	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said panic erupted at the school, which offers courses in catering, tourism, nursing and home economics, as the masked gunman entered just before 11 a.m. and started firing in a classroom where students were taking an exam.
11874	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	A video clip posted on the Internet by the alleged gunman showed him pointing his gun to the camera and saying "You will die next" before firing four rounds.
11875	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The rampage bore eerie similarities to another school massacre in Finland last year in which an 18-year-old gunman killed eight people and himself.
11876	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	After that massacre, the government promised to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 15 to 18, but legislation was never passed.
11877	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	That change would not have stopped either of the recent school shooters, who were 18 and 22 years old.

11964	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain focusing on Iowa despite polls
11965	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES, Iowa 2008-09-30 16:49:22 UTC
11966	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
11967	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrats counter that McCain's event Tuesday in Des Moines shows he cannot be elected president without winning in states where he trails his rival.
11968	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Republicans acknowledge that McCain is behind, but say the race is closer than the polling indicates.
11969	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I honestly believe right now in Iowa that Obama is ahead but it is less than five," said former Iowa Republican Chairman Michael Mahaffey.
11970	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	A Des Moines Register poll conducted Sept. 8-10 showed Obama ahead, 52 percent to 40 percent, while a Big Ten Battleground Poll a few days later, conducted Sept. 14-17, found the rivals tied at 45 percent.
11971	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks.
11972	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He held a small-business round-table in Des Moines, following up on a Sept. 18 stop in Cedar Rapids with running mate Sarah Palin.
11973	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	His campaign also has continued television advertising in the state at roughly the same level as Obama.
11974	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe Sen. Obama has the lead that one or two polls indicate he does," said veteran Republican strategist Eric Woolson.
11975	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	That Republican optimism comes despite voter registration trends that show Democrats have gained a more than a 100,000-person edge in Iowa.
11976	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Still, the last two presidential elections were decided by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point.
11977	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrat Al Gore won the state in 2000, and President George W. Bush won it during his re-election in 2004 -- and independent voters still outnumber those in each of the major parties.
11978	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
11979	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"They still have the time, they still have the money.
11980	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	It's too early for them to bail out of Iowa," he said, noting the fairly cheap cost of advertising here.
11981	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Veteran Republican strategist Bob Haus said all candidates should be nervous about the Nov. 4 election.
11982	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I have never seen an election that has had this many violent mood swings," he said.

12007	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-10-04 02:48:25 UTC
12008	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered a Texas doctor and his wife on Friday not to distribute videotaped footage of Anna Nicole Smith's breast augmentation surgery in 1994.
12009	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The order settles alawsuit filed last year by Howard K. Stern, the executor of Smith's estate, who was trying to stop Dr. Gerald Johnson and his wife from distributing the tapes of the former Playboy Playmate and reality star who died last year.
12010	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff issued preliminary injunctions against the Johnsons more than a year ago before issuing his final decision.
12011	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern maintained that Smith never consented to the taping or to allowing the footage to be seen by Los Angeles memorabilia dealer Thomas Riccio, who got tapes from the Johnsons, according to court records.
12012	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Johnson has said he routinely records surgeries with the patient's permission and promises to keep the video confidential "during the patient's lifetime."
12013	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	He said he gave Riccio permission to use the video after Smith died of a drug overdose in February 2007 in Florida.
12014	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She was 39.
12015	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Riccio's daughter edited the footage into a five-minute tape, scored with music similar to the theme from the film "Jaws."
12016	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The Johnsons' Houston-based attorney, Gus Pappas, did not return a message seeking comment Friday.
12017	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Larry Birkhead, who fathered Smith's daughter, called the video "truly disgusting" in a sworn declaration issued last year.
12018	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	"It was clear that Anna Nicole was unconscious during the videotaping, and even more disturbing, the videotape focused on areas of her nude body that were unrelated to the location of the surgery," he said in the declaration.
12019	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern's attorney, Vivian Thoreen, said all the tapes have been accounted for under the judge's previous orders.
12020	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She said the other terms of the settlement are confidential.
12021	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Although the Johnsons live in Texas, the Los Angeles Superior Court still has jurisdiction because the physician allegedly tried to disseminate the tape in Los Angeles County, said attorney Bruce S. Ross, who also represents Stern.

12024	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Tenor Placido Domingo peppered his classical repertoire with a crowd-pleasing array of popular music and even donned a mariachi suit and sang along with the audience, smoothing over controversy surrounding his Saturday concert at the Mayan pyramids of Chichen Itza.
12025	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	With help from Mexican crooner Armando Manzanero and Puerto Rican soprano Ana Maria Martinez, an ebullient Domingo won over the crowd with encores ranging from West Side Story's "Tonight," to the popular ballad of southern Yucatan state, "Peregrina."
12026	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo and Martinez also joined forces on a thundering, majestic tribute to the Mayan ruins in "The Silver Moon of Chichen Itza," by Lorena Tassinari, which he called "a kind of Mayan hymn."
12027	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The singers were dwarfed by the hulking mass of the site's main pyramid, eerily illuminated in red against a black sky, and the concert began with Mayan-style music from by The Monumental Chorus of the Mayab, accompanied by Indian drums
12028	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins.
12029	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The concert's name is a reference to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.
12030	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is marvelous to be here," Domingo said during a break.
12031	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is an honor for us to have a concert like this," said Armando de Leon from the nearby city of Merida.
12032	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Herman Segovia came all the way from San Antonio, Texas, to hear Domingo, whom he called "an artist of high quality."
12033	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the site will be damaged.
12034	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	This is a controlled event," Segovia said.
12035	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Karen Eddy, originally of Toronto, Canada, traveled to the concert from her current home in Mexico City because "I thought it would be magical, just magical" to see Domingo sing in front of the towering main pyramid.
12036	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and activists have complained that concerts like Saturday's expose ruin sites to additional damage and degrade their cultural significance by treating them as mere backdrops.
12037	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Mexico's federal government turns down most requests to hold concerts at ancient temples.
12038	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But it faces increasing pressure from state governors to promote ruins which, critics argue, are already swamped with tourists.
12039	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Officials did impose limits on stage and seating structures and the number of spectators for Domingo's concert, ensuring that it would be smaller than tenor Luciano Pavarotti's 1997 appearance at Chichen Itza, which drew 17,000.
12040	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Since then, more than a half dozen concerts have been held at or near the ruins.
12041	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Despite intermittent drops of rain, Domingo opened masterfully with the inspiring "O Souverain" from Massenet's Le Cid.
12042	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo and local hero Manzanero won a standing ovation for a duet -- which the Mexican sang party in Mayan -- on Manzanero's love ballad "Adoro."

12048	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo sang Zarzuela from his native Spain, and drew a swell of applause for the classic Granada.
12049	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But the audience went wild when, in an encore, Domingo donned a silver-buttoned suit like the ones used by Mexico's cowboy- singers and belted out mariachi classics like "El Rey", at times asking the audience to sing along.
12050	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The program also includes the melancholy, melodic "Lamento di Federico" from Francesco Cilea's "L'Arlesiana," and the soaring "Gia nella notte densa" from Verdi's Otello.

12065	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-10-08 20:45:49 UTC
12066	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	John McCain's health care plan would reduce the ranks of the roughly 45 million uninsured Americans by about 21.1 million people if fully implemented by 2010, while Barack Obama's would reduce the number by 26.6 million, a new analysis predicts.
12067	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Some previous reviews of the two presidential candidates' health plans indicated that Republican McCain's proposals would amount to little more than a wash when it comes to the number of uninsured in the United States.
12068	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The analysis released Wednesday by The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, drew a more optimistic scenario about the overall number of people who would get health coverage under McCain's plan.
12069	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The cost for both candidates' plans are enormous.
12070	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain's plan was projected to cost more than $2 trillion from 2010 through 2019.
12071	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Democrat Obama's plan would cost $1.17 trillion.
12072	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Neither candidate provides specifics on how to cover the costs, The Lewin Group said.
12073	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The United States, which has a population of about 300 million, is one of the few western countries without universal health care.
12074	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain has proposed two distinct changes to the current system.
12075	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The first is a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals or $5,000 for a family that buys health insurance.
12076	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The credit would replace the tax break people now get for obtaining health coverage through their work.
12077	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Second, McCain calls for letting people shop across state lines when buying insurance, essentially letting millions bypass states where insurance is more expensive and comprehensive.
12078	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	About half of the nation's uninsured adults are ages 19-34.
12079	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	They are the youngest and cheapest to cover, and they are the ones that would generally gain coverage under McCain's proposal, Sheils said.
12080	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Obama's plan would expand health insurance coverage through public programs.
12081	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	He requires all children to have health coverage.
12082	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	In all, about 16 million people would gain coverage through those programs.
12083	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Another 10 million would use government subsidies to buy insurance coverage.

12089	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan has appealed for more NATO help to attack heroin dealers whose thriving trade is blamed for bankrolling the widening insurgency against the pro-Western government and international forces.
12090	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak made the appeal Thursday at a meeting with his NATO counterparts against the backdrop of spreading violence that has sparked doubt about whether Western forces can win the war against the Taliban.
12091	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"We've asked NATO to please support us, support our effort in destroying the labs and also the interdiction of the drugs and the chemical precursors that are coming from outside the country for making heroin," Wardak told reporters after the meeting.
12092	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Wardak's appeal follows lobbying by the United States to persuade allies to hit back against the insurgency by striking against the drug lords who are estimated to provide up to US$100 million (euro72.83 million) a year to the Taliban and their al-Qaida allies.
12093	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"If we have the opportunity to go after drug lords and drug laboratories and try and interrupt this flow of cash to the Taliban, that seems to me like a legitimate security endeavor," said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
12094	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Most allies agree, but Gates complained that some allies were balking at the plan for NATO to take on a task currently the responsibility of Afghanistan's fledgling police force.
12095	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Germany, Spain and others are concerned that a counter-narcotics campaign could spark a backlash against the 50,000 NATO troops even if, as NATO commanders insist, the campaign will not target poor farmers who depend on growing opium poppies for a living.
12096	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	They also fear widening the mission could overstretch the hard- pressed troops and undermine NATO's long-term goal of handing more responsibility to Afghan forces.
12097	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	However Germany's defense minister hinted they could change their position in the light of Wardak's appeal.
12098	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"If this remains under Afghan leadership, it is in our own interest to support this activity," Franz Josef Jung, told reporters.
12099	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	NATO's top diplomat said he was optimistic the 26 allies will agree when the meeting resumes Friday.
12100	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"I hope that tomorrow morning ministers will be able to come to some form of a conclusion," said Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.
12101	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"Our guys are killed by the weapons bought by the Taliban, financed by drugs money."
12102	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Gates said one option on the table was to allow some nations who are opposed to the plan to "opt out" without blocking others from participating.
12103	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	NATO officials explained that it could, for example, allow U.S. planes to bomb drug labs in northern Afghanistan without involving the German troops based there.
12104	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Gates was also seeking more troops, equipment, funding and other contributions to the Afghan war from the allies, including training teams for the Afghan security forces which are seen as key to an eventual withdrawal of international forces.
12105	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Reflecting concerns that Afghanistan is becoming the critical battlefield in the fight against terrorism, the U.S. has already said it would send about 8,000 troops to Afghanistan by early next year.
12106	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	De Hoop Scheffer said several allies had come forward with more contributions, but he declined to give details, and said it was not enough.
12107	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"I'm not satisfied and I'm not happy about the way the allies are performing in this regard," he told reporters, saying a lack of helicopters and transport planes remained a particular problem.
12108	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	The Afghan government is seeking talks with elements in the Taliban leadership in an effort at reconciliation and the Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan said the two sides have had contacts in Saudi Arabia.

12115	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	ANCHORAGE, Alaska 2008-10-10 01:44:59 UTC
12116	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	On the eve of a report on a legislative panel's abuse-of-power investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Republican campaign officials released their own report clearing her of any wrongdoing.
12117	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Palin, running mate to Republican presidential nominee John McCain, is the subject of two inquiries into whether she abused her power by firing her public safety commissioner.
12118	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	The commissioner says he was dismissed for resisting pressure to fire Palin's former brother-in-law, a state police officer.
12119	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers in one of the inquiries are expected to release their findings Friday.
12120	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	The report the McCain-Palin campaign released Thursday night says the firing was based on a budget dispute.
12121	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Since then, the report says, the matter has been muddled with innuendo, rumor and politics.

12123	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	BANGALORE, India 2008-10-12 14:10:35 UTC
12124	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	After three years in the test wilderness, cricket allrounder Shane Watson was having the time of his life Sunday on his return to the Australia side for the first of four tests against India.
12125	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson's most important contribution in the match so far came when he and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (28 not out) helped lift Australia from a perilous 128 for 5 in the second innings with a 65-run unbeaten partnership.
12126	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	At stumps Australia was 193-5 wickets and had a lead of 263.
12127	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson compiled a nerveless 32 not out from 67 balls and was ecstatic with his input over the first four days.
12128	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"This test has been the most fun I've ever had playing cricket," he said.
12129	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing learning experience.
12130	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Just batting out there is the most I've ever learnt in an innings."
12131	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson overcame the duel dangers of offspinner Harbhajan Singh, who was responsible for the early damage with 2-76, and the searing reverse swing of Zaheer Khan.
12132	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing three or four days so far," he said.
12133	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"I'm having more fun than I ever thought I'd have playing cricket.
12134	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I'm just making the most of it and enjoying every second."
12135	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson, 27, was called into the touring squad last month after Andrew Symonds was stood down for disciplinary reasons.
12136	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	It was the end of a long road back from a run of injuries that started when he dislocated a shoulder while fielding in a test against the West Indies in 2005.
12137	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Since then he has had regular problems with a troublesome hamstring but fought his way into the test team through consistent performances in the Indian Premier League and the one- day international side.
12138	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson also chipped in with three wickets as Australia dismissed India for 360 and gained a 70-run first innings lead.
12139	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	He removed Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Saturday before trapping Anil Kumble lbw in the morning session.
12140	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"Wickets to me don't matter," he said.
12141	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"My role is to bowl as tightly as I can and build pressure, to make it extremely hard.
12142	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I enjoy every wicket I get -- but they're a massive bonus."
12143	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson will get more bowling on the final day once Australia decide when to declare its innings and push for victory.
12144	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Paceman Stuart Clark has a sore elbow that is preventing him from throwing overarm but he is expected to bowl on Monday.
12145	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson said he had not talked to Ricky Ponting about his plans for the final day, but had faith in Australia's bowlers to seal a 1-0 advantage in the first of four tests.
12146	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"The ball is going to reverse swing fairly quickly, which is very handy for our quicks," Watson said.
12147	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"The wicket is deteriorating a little, but definitely not as much as I thought it would.
12148	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	We are going to have to bowl extremely well to bowl the Indians out."

12156	APW_ENG_20081015.0065.LDC2009T13	The new donation is believed to be the largest individual gift to a hospital in Kansas or the Kansas City area.

12159	APW_ENG_20081015.0065.LDC2009T13	Annette Bloch said she hoped the donation would help get the Kansas Cancer Center designated as a National Cancer Institute.
12160	APW_ENG_20081015.0065.LDC2009T13	The cancer center, which is blended with the hospital's cancer program, would then be able to attract more grants, clinical trials and research programs.

12165	APW_ENG_20081016.0717.LDC2009T13	The St. Louis-based company that's one of the world's biggest coal producers reported net income of $369 million, or $1.36 cents per share, from $32.3 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company said higher acquisition-related debt and interest costs offset an increase in revenue.
12166	APW_ENG_20081016.0717.LDC2009T13	Revenue in the most recent period rose to $1.9 billion from $1.2 billion.

12171	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	China Investment Corp., the government's sovereign wealth fund, may raise its stake in U.S. investment group Blackstone LP after the two agreed to boost the Chinese company's ownership limit.
12172	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	CIC had paid US$3 billion for a stake in Blackstone's June 2007 initial public offering, but has seen the value of that investment sink in the bear market, to the consternation of many in China.
12173	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	According to a regulatory filing, a revised agreement reached Thursday between Blackstone and CIC unit Beijing Wonderful Investments Ltd. has raised the limit on the Chinese company's stake to 12.5 percent from 9.99 percent.
12174	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, posted on Blackstone's Web site, did not require regulatory approval.
12175	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	There was no official comment from CIC on its plans for additional share purchases.
12176	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	At the time of Blackstone's IPO, its shares were valued at US$31 apiece.
12177	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, they rose 1.7 percent to US$9.36.
12178	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	The US$200 billion investment arm of the Chinese government was set up to make profitable use of Beijing's foreign reserves, which totaled US$1.9 trillion by the end of September.

12180	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	But there has been grumbling about the performance of some of the fund's higher profile investments amid the recent market turmoil.
12181	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	CIC's biggest investment to date was a US$5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley, one of nine major banks now seeking relief from the deepening credit crisis through the U.S. government's US$700 billion banking bailout.
12182	APW_ENG_20081017.0245.LDC2009T13	That purchase will give it a 9.9 percent stake in the investment bank.

12186	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	European markets rose strongly Friday as a recovery in the price of oil helped oil stocks, but Wall Street was down after further grim U.S. economic news.
12187	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 201.62 points, or 5.2 percent, higher at 4,063.01, while Germany's DAX was up 158.52 points, or 3.4 percent, at 4,781.33.

12189	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Europe's indexes were higher through the day in the wake of the Dow's strong performance Thursday and the recovery on Japan's Nikkei.

12191	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell more than 6 percent in September to an annual rate of 817,000 units, a near 18-year low, while and the University of Michigan said its U.S. consumer confidence index slumped to 57.5 in October from 70.3 the previous month.
12192	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"The drop back in U.S. consumer confidence in October suggests that the meltdown in the financial markets, rising unemployment and the continued weakness in housing more than offset any positive boost from lower gasoline prices," said Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
12193	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It's been an erratic week on Wall Street, with the Dow soaring 936 points on Monday, slipping moderately Tuesday, sinking 733 points Wednesday, and then rallying 401 points Thursday.
12194	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The volatility is not providing investors with much relief, but it is a welcome change from last week's seemingly relentless plunge, during which the Dow logged its worst week ever and Wall Street lost about $2.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.
12195	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The long-term key to the health of financial markets is whether the flurry of activity by governments over the last week or so can actually break the logjam in credit markets.
12196	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	There are growing signs the coordinated interest rate reductions announced last week, and massive liquidity boosts by central banks, are beginning to reduce lending rates between banks.
12197	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The interbank lending rate for three-month dollar loans fell for the fifth day running, the first weekly decline in three months.
12198	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It dropped 0.08 percent to 4.42 percent, while the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, fell almost 0.045 percentage points to 5.045 percent.
12199	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rates are falling, the differential between the rate at which banks lend to each other and official central bank lending rates remain high, signalling a strong degree of mistrust still exists.
12200	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. the base central bank rate is 1.5 percent, while in the euro area it stands at 3.75 percent.
12201	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"Even if the financial maelstrom may be about to abate it is not over," said Russell Jones, global head of fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
12202	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"A serious global recession is 'baked in the cake' and this is bound to mean that there will be further pulses of risk aversion, further traumas for financial sectors and markets and acute pain both for corporate sectors and for individuals," he added.
12203	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rescue packages have helped alleviate the pressures on the banking system, threats in the financial system remain, from credit default swaps -- which insure against defaults on securities -- from the insurance sector and from emerging markets.
12204	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Following the bailout of the banks, investor concerns have moved onto the insurance sector.

12207	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Concerns about the global economic outlook have taken their toll on oil prices in recent days, which fell Thursday to near 14-month lows below US$70 before recovering US$1.92 Friday to US$71.77.
12208	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Friday's modest recovery in the oil price helped some stocks in Europe recover ground, notably BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell on the FTSE, which both rose 8 percent.
12209	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Both had suffered major drops Thursday when oil prices dropped steeply.
12210	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Despite Friday's rise, oil prices are half what they were just three months ago and that is weighing on countries dependent on oil exports, such as Russia.

12270	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	KIEV, Ukraine 2008-10-27 11:56:22 UTC
12271	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Leaders of clashing Ukrainian parliamentary factions on Monday discussed legislation required to receive a crucial $16.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund as the country struggles to stay afloat amid a severe financial crisis.
12272	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	The IMF made the loan conditional on the passage of laws aimed at boosting the shaken banking sector, but the deepening political crisis threatens to torpedo the deal.
12273	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	The work of the Verkhovna Rada has been blocked all last week by allies of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is fighting an order by President Viktor Yushchenko to hold early parliamentary elections in December.
12274	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Experts hope the IMF loan, which amounts to nearly half of the country's current foreign currency reserves, will shore up the shaken financial sector and give the central bank the necessary reserves to defend the falling national currency, the hryvna, which has plunged over 20 percent in recent months.
12275	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	"This will allow the National Bank to counter the devaluation pressures on the hryvna," said Olena Bilan, a macroeconomics analyst with Dragon Capital investment bank.
12276	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	The hryvna plunged to a historic low of 6.01 to the dollar last week after a 40 percent fall in exports and a run on banks that stripped the banking sector of $3.4 billion this month as Ukrainians rushed to convert their savings into dollars.
12277	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Ukraine is in for a painful economic downturn.
12278	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Output in the steel industry, which accounts for 6 percent of the GDP and 40 percent of the country's exports, was down by 30 percent.
12279	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	The country's main automobile producer, the Zaporizhye Automobile Building Plant, said Monday its output fell by 8.6 percent in September compared to last year's figures.

12284	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The "deteriorating" economic and political climate in Argentina prompted Standard &amp
12285	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	Poor's Ratings Services on Friday to lower the country's debt ratings to six levels below investment grade.
12286	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The ratings company lowered Argentina's foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings to 'B-' from 'B,' which translates into a heightened risk for those who want to put their capital in the country and an increasing probability of default for the South American country.
12287	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The company attributed the downgrade in part to last week's government proposal to nationalize private pension funds, which has greatly spooked investors, sending overall confidence in the local markets into a tailspin.
12288	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The global crisis drove Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index down 44 percent between July 1 and the beginning of last week.
12289	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The Merval plummeted 20 percent more -- its lowest level in four years -- after President Cristina Fernandez proposed the state takeover.
12290	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The index has since rebounded slightly, but analysts attribute the recuperation to favorable investment decisions in the U.S. and Europe, rather than domestic measures.
12291	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	Friday's cut is the second issued by S&amp
12292	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	P in less than three months.
12293	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	"The downgrade reflects our heightened concerns about the deteriorating economic and political environment in Argentina and the resulting increased fiscal stress," analyst David Beers said in a statement issued by the company Friday morning from London.
12294	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The outlook remains stable, however, since the government still has a "financing cushion," Beers said, including nearly $47 billion in federal reserves as of Oct. 17.
12295	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	He predicted the financial crisis would curtail demand, keeping commodity prices low and producing a sharp drop in Argentina's economic growth.
12296	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The agricultural powerhouse is one of the world's top grain and beef exporters.
12297	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	Slower growth will make it increasingly difficult for the government to service $28 billion in debt, which comes due over the next three years.
12298	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The government's financing problems have been exacerbated by a virtual lockout from the international credit market after the country defaulted on US$95 billion in 2001 -- the largest amount in history.
12299	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	S&amp
12300	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	P's and Moody's Investor Services -- another top ratings agency -- issued harsh assessments of Argentine risk in mid- August amid concerns that slowing growth, soaring prices and steep public spending would keep the government from servicing its debt.
12301	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	Moody's will not lower its current B3 rating, which already is six levels below investment grade and represents a great risk of default, Gabriel Torres, a senior analyst for Moody's in New York told The Associated Press.
12302	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	"Countries in the B category are countries that we describe as being one shock away from default," Torres said.
12303	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	Argentina has found a "natural" -- if high-risk -- floor, and is not on the brink of default yet, he said.
12304	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The rating puts Argentina on par with Bolivia, Paraguay and Ecuador in the region.
12305	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	"This rating cut reflects the increased uncertainty the Argentine economy is facing," said economist Carolina Schuff, an analyst with the Buenos Aires-based economic Web site abeceb.com, adding she was not surprised by the cut.
12306	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The international financial uncertainty facing Argentina has been exacerbated by domestic decisions like the government's recent proposal to grab private pension funds, she said.
12307	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	"They're constantly changing the rules, and many investments are long term, requiring foresight," which the government's surprise announcement doesn't provide, Schuff said.

12309	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2008-11-04 03:12:32 UTC
12310	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	A Malaysian parliamentary panel has cleared the government of any wrongdoing in an aborted deal to buy European military helicopters, an official said Tuesday.
12311	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Public Accounts Committee, composed of government and opposition lawmakers, said the 1.6 billion ringgit ($454 million) deal to purchase 12 EC725 helicopters from Eurocopter followed correct procedures.
12312	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee investigated opposition accusations that the price was too high and the negotiations did not go through proper channels -- even though the deal was scrapped last week because of budget constraints amid the global economic crisis.
12313	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"According to what we have seen, we were satisfied that all procedures were up to the standard," committee chairman Azmi Khalid told The Associated Press.
12314	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"If there were any wrongdoings, we would have figured it out.
12315	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	But there was nothing that was obvious enough."
12316	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee discussed the deal with Defense and Finance ministry officials after opposition politicians claimed there were irregularities in the tender process and that the price tag was too high.
12317	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is expected to take over as prime minister next March, had signed the letter of intent to purchase the equipment from Eurocopter, the world's largest helicopter maker, shortly before he handed over the defense portfolio to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in September.
12318	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Eurocopters were meant to replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky helicopters, renamed Nuri by the Malaysians.
12319	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	But Abdullah announced last Tuesday that he was suspending the deal because of the financial crisis.
12320	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	He said the government would use the money for other public projects.
12321	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	Tian Chua, an opposition lawmaker with the People's Justice Party, said the inquiry's conclusions did not quell doubts about the price tag because the panel looked only at procedural issues.
12322	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"It does not mean that at each step (the government) made the right decision," he said.
12323	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of unanswered questions."
12324	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The country's Anti-Corruption Agency is also probing the deal.

12333	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"The market has really gotten ahead of itself, and falsely priced in that this recession wasn't going to be as prolonged as thought," said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management, a subsidiary of RBC Dain Rauscher.
12334	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"We're in a really bad recession, period," he said.
12335	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"Wall Street can spin it anyway they want to, but this is likely going to be more prolonged than people anticipated.
12336	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	People are locking in profits and realizing we're not out of the woods."
12337	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Beyond broad economic concerns, worries about the financial sector intensified after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. began to notify about 3,200 employees globally that they have been lost their jobs as part of a broader plan to slash 10 percent of the investment bank's work force, a person familiar with the situation said.

12361	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Analysts agree that Obama's most immediate priority will be dealing with the nation's financial crisis and deciding how to further implement the $700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last month.
12362	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Goldman said trading could remain turbulent as investors begin assessing the shape and direction of Obama's forthcoming economic policies.
12363	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"The market has to go through a period of figuring out if they are going to gain confidence in Obama and the Congress or lose it," he said, adding that investors will be paying close attention to who will be appointed to top economic posts.
12364	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Obama's victory means that industries such as oil and gas producers, utilities and pharmaceuticals may face greater regulation and even taxes, while labor unions and automakers are expected to benefit.
12365	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	In addition, banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and the rest of the financial sector will almost certainly face attempts at a regulatory overhaul by the Democratic Congress next year.

12370	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	In addition to monitoring the direction the next administration will take, investors continue to heed the state of the credit markets.
12371	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The paralysis in the credit markets that began after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in mid-September has been alleviated somewhat by a series of government interventions, but they still show some signs of strain.
12372	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Banks continued to ratchet down the rates they charge one another for borrowing on Wednesday, but the key interbank lending rate -- the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor -- remains well above the Federal Reserve's target interest rate of 1 percent.
12373	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Libor for three-month dollar loans fell to 2.51 percent from 2.71 percent Tuesday.

12376	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	A low yield indicates high demand.
12377	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell slightly to 3.71 percent from 3.73 percent late Tuesday.
12378	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
12379	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Other sectors that are being closely watched in light of the election results are pharmaceuticals and alternative energy, analysts said.

12435	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-11-14 04:43:44 UTC
12436	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera is giving up "The Ghosts."
12437	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting costs in the wake of the economic downturn, the Met is dropping next season's highly anticipated revival of John Corigliano's "The Ghosts of Versailles" that was to feature the company debut of Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.
12438	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Angela Gheorghiu and Thomas Hampson, who also were to appear, instead will sing in a less-costly revival of Verdi's "La Traviata," Met general manager Peter Gelb said Thursday.
12439	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"In looking at ways to economize, that was an unfortunate sacrifice," Gelb said in a telephone interview.
12440	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's a much more expensive revival than most."
12441	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said all eight new productions will proceed as planned, but that some revivals may be replaced with less expensive ones.
12442	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in March 2010.
12443	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting it will save more than $1 million.
12444	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"If you look around at all the opera houses and what's happening, it's obvious that this is a time of crisis.
12445	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Peter is just doing what he can to save the company," Corigliano said.
12446	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Times have changed from the past in terms of grand opera.
12447	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In this country, at least, it's certainly boning down."
12448	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb had been a big proponent of increasing the Met's presentations of works by living composers.
12449	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We will plan to put it in on at another time," he said.
12450	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Chenoweth was understanding.
12451	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Kristin is, of course, disappointed, as she was very excited to work with John Corigliano," spokeswoman Jill Fritzo said.
12452	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"She has a great deal of respect for Peter Gelb and understands the steps that need to be taken during this economic crisis."
12453	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb hopes to find another opera for the Tony Award-winning Chenoweth, an opera-trained soprano, but nothing has been finalized.
12454	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"As we are examining the cost of running the Met season with an ever-increasingly careful eye toward saving costs, we're looking at the running costs of certain revivals compared to others," Gelb said.
12455	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It will involve the shifting of some repertoire."
12456	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	He was not prepared to announce other shifts in revivals because discussions with the singers are ongoing.
12457	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The decision by the Met, the largest musical institution in the United States, is the most high-profile evidence of the profound changes the economy is causing in the arts world.
12458	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Washington National Opera announced this week that it is postponing next season's presentation of Wagner's four-opera "Der Ring des Nibelungen," which had been planned since 2001.
12459	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The company said that while it anticipated sellouts, "even the strongest ticket sales cover only a fraction of production expenses and the opera must look to the generosity of individuals, foundations and corporations to support its work."
12460	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"The dramatic changes in the nation's economy have made all of us who are responsible for WNO's welfare reluctantly come to the difficult decision to postpone the Ring Cycle until the financial climate becomes more positive," general director Placido Domingo said.
12461	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Opera Pacific in Santa Ana, California, last week canceled its remaining productions this season, Ricky Ian Gordon's "The Grapes of Wrath" and Strauss' "Salome," according to a recording on the company's main telephone number.
12462	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	There is a chance Opera Pacific will close for good.
12463	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gerard Mortier, who was to take over as general manager and artistic director of the New York City Opera next season, quit last Friday because the company failed to raise enough money to pay for his plans.
12464	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Change has been less drastic at the Met.
12465	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Next season is the first completely planned by Gelb, and the eight new productions are the Met's most since 1966-67, its initial season at Lincoln Center.
12466	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb responded to inquiries about the change in plans a day after the Web site Opera Chic said the Met intended to cut four unspecified productions from next season's schedule.
12467	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said that when this season opened late September, the box office had been 2 percent ahead of the 2007-08 season, when prices were essentially the same.
12468	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Now, the season-to-season comparison is even.
12469	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We're experiencing fluctuations at the box office," he said.
12470	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Things are less predictable than they were last season."
12471	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In other Met news, Gelb said the company will soon release its first self-produced DVD, the English-language version of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute."
12472	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Previous Met releases have been issued by commercial recording companies.

12475	APW_ENG_20081115.0724.LDC2009T13	World leaders promised Saturday to do whatever is needed to protect global financial system from collapsing under the weight of a massive economic downturn that erupted with implosion of the American housing market in mid-2008.

12497	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
12498	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It announced the hijacking on Monday when it first received the information.
12499	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said the ship was hijacked Sunday.
12500	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The discrepancy could not immediately be explained.
12501	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year as bandits have become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of miles from shore.
12502	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	A coalition of warships from eight nations, as well as from NATO and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is patrolling a critical zone in the Gulf of Aden leading to and from the Suez Canal.
12503	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	That's where most of the more than 80 attacks this year have occurred.
12504	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.
12505	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost impossible to patrol.
12506	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25 and remains in pirate hands.
12507	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"I don't anticipate any U.S. ships on station," said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet, speaking from its headquarters in Bahrain.
12508	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.
12509	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea," Christensen said.
12510	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates, though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been hijacked.
12511	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It is "the largest pirated vessel in the region" to date, Christensen said.
12512	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	At 1,080 feet (329 meters), it is the length of an aircraft carrier and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
12513	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"We are very concerned that a (ship) of this size has been hijacked.
12514	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	We have safety concerns, security concerns, environmental concerns," said Noel Choong, the head of the International Maritime Bureau's regional piracy center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
12515	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"Of course, as long as there is no firm deterrent, pirates will continue to attack.
12516	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The risk is low and returns are extremely high.
12517	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	You will see more and more of such attacks," he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
12518	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The vessel is still on its wayff the Somali port of Eyl, Christensen said.
12519	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Somali fishermen and witnesses on shore said the pirates apparently anchored the ship last night in Harardhere, a pirate stronghold some 265 miles (430 kilometers) by land from Eyl.
12520	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The Saudi tanker was just a few miles from shore Tuesday morning, said Abdinur Haji, a fisherman.
12521	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"As usual, I woke up at 3 a.m. and headed for the sea to fish, but I saw a very, very large ship anchored less than three miles (five kilometers) off the shore," he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
12522	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He said two small boats floated out to the ship and 18 men -- presumably other pirates -- climbed aboard with ropes woven into a ladder.
12523	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"I have been fishing here for three decades, but I have never seen a ship as big as this one," he said.
12524	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"There are dozens of spectators on shore trying to catch a glimpse of the large ship, which they can see with their naked eyes."
12525	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Vela, the ship's owner and operator, says it is one of the largest crude oil tanker companies in the world.
12526	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19 vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers and five product tankers of various sizes.
12527	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It transports supplies primarily between the Middle East, Europe and the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to the company's Web site.
12528	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The Sirius Star was sailing under a Liberian flag and its crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
12529	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals on board.

12533	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2008-11-18 18:20:36 UTC
12534	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev SA formed the world's largest brewer Tuesday when it completed its $52 billion (euro41 billion) takeover of Anheuser- Busch Cos.
12535	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Inc.
12536	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company, named Anheuser-Busch InBev, will be headed by InBev CEO Carlos Brito and will be headquartered at Leuven, Belgium.
12537	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev promises to keep Anheuser-Busch's St. Louis base as the company's North American headquarters but the takeover ends 150 years of family rule at Anheuser-Busch.
12538	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch President and CEO August A. Busch IV joins the new company's board as a non-executive director.
12539	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch shares stopped trading Monday and will now be swapped for $70 each in cash.
12540	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The Belgian-Brazilian takeover of Anheuser-Busch comes after a bitter battle turned sweeter with a higher offer in July, despite protests in St. Louis that saw politicians criticize the deal and Web sites call for Bud to be saved from "the waffle guys."
12541	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch provides half of America's beer but it has not managed to expand around the world as fast as InBev -- a Belgian- Brazilian hybrid that owns hundreds of local brands but few real stars.
12542	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev has promised to keep all 12 North American breweries open as long as the company faces no new U.S. taxes.
12543	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch already plans to shed 1,185 jobs -- mostly by offering early retirement and not filling vacancies.
12544	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The company did not mention a dispute with Mexico's largest brewer Grupo Modelo -- which was 50-percent owned by Anheuser- Busch.
12545	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Grupo Modelo filed a notice of arbitration against Anheuser-Busch last month, saying the takeover violated their investment agreement and its right of consent to enter into a partnership with InBev.
12546	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Taking over Anheuser-Busch gives InBev a jewel of a brand in Budweiser -- the world's top selling beer -- which it promises to sell more widely by pushing into emerging economies in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe.
12547	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It will sell a fifth of all beer in both Russia and China.
12548	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	This will help generate growth as beer sales decline in North America and Europe where drinkers are cutting back and turning to wine and other drinks.
12549	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company leapfrogs SABMiller as top brewer and becomes one of the world's top five consumer goods companies.
12550	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Brito said the combination had created "a stronger, more competitive global company with a leading international brand portfolio and distribution network, and great potential for growth all over the world."
12551	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev said it now had all the regulatory clearances it needed for the deal.
12552	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	China approved the takeover on Tuesday but barred the company from increasing existing stakes in Chinese brewers.
12553	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It said it was necessary to prevent Anheuser-Busch InBev becoming a monopoly in the country.
12554	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	This curbs future growth in the world's most populous nation.
12555	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It caps Anheuser-Busch's 27-percent stake in Tsingtao Beer Ltd. and InBev's 28.5 percent holding in Zhujiang Beer Ltd.
12556	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	They will also be prohibited from linking up with two leading Chinese breweries, Huarun Snow Beer Ltd. and Beijing Yanjing Beer Ltd.
12557	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Department of Justice cleared the deal last week after InBev agreed to sell Labatt USA, which sells the Canadian beer in the U.S.
12558	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It will hold on to Labatt in Canada.
12559	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev did not say who would buy the American unit.
12560	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	U.S. antitrust officials had worried that beer prices would increase in upstate New York because -- with Budweiser and Labatt Blue -- the two companies would supply most of the beer in the region.
12561	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev has borrowed $45 billion to pay for the deal and secured $9.8 billion in equity bridge financing that it had planned to replace with a share issue in October.
12562	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	But rocky financial markets forced it to postpone issuing new shares and it says it can keep the bridge financing in place for up to six months after it closes the deal and issue shares early next year.
12563	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev says the company is well positioned to cope with a slowing global economy because costs for key ingredients such as grain malt for brewing beer and aluminum for beer cans will fall even as sales stall.
12564	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev is renowned for shaving costs since it was formed in a 2004 merger between Belgium's Interbrew and Brazil-based AmBev.
12565	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Beer industry analysts Plato Logic says beer sales will slow significantly to expand just 3 percent next year as economies around the world shrink or stagnate.

12575	APW_ENG_20081119.1077.LDC2009T13	Cap Cana fired 500 workers last month after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and a $250 million loan fell through.
12576	APW_ENG_20081119.1077.LDC2009T13	Talks to re-negotiate a $100 million short-term loan collapsed last week, and more layoffs are expected.
12577	APW_ENG_20081119.1077.LDC2009T13	"Our project has been affected by the economic tsunami that has paralyzed the global financial markets," said Cap Cana President Ricardo Hazoury.

12625	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina 2008-11-20 18:46:29 UTC
12626	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Argentina's David Nalbandian will face Spain's David Ferrer on Friday in the opening match of the Davis Cup final.
12627	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Juan Martin del Potro, Argentina's top-ranked player at No. 9, was drawn Thursday to play Feliciano Lopez in the second singles match of the best-of-five series -- just like Argentina captain Alberto Mancini wanted.
12628	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Juan Martin had a slight preference to play second," Mancini said.
12629	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"And the fact that David is first is good because he has more experience."
12630	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	In Saturday's doubles, Jose Acasuso and Agustin Calleri of Argentina will play Lopez and Fernando Verdasco.
12631	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	The reverse singles will be held Sunday.
12632	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Argentina has a great team and they want to win and have a big celebration," Spain captain Emilio Sanchez Vicario said.
12633	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"But we're Spanish and we also have a great team and we want to have our celebration, although a little smaller since we're not in our own country."
12634	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Nalbandian has lost six of the nine times he has played Ferrer, while Del Potro has won two of the three against Lopez.
12635	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Ferrer is a complete player, very even, solid along the back of the court, and he runs and fights for each ball," Nalbandian said.
12636	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Marcel Granollers, called up as a replacement for the injured Rafael Nadal, could still play because each captain has the right to make changes.
12637	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Argentina is hoping Nadal's absence -- because of tendinitis in his knee -- will boost its chances to win the Davis Cup for the first time, while Spain is trying to win its third title.
12638	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Being hosts and with Rafa not coming, no one doubts that Argentina is the favorite," Mancini said.
12639	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Ferrer agreed, sort of.
12640	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"With Rafa we weren't the favorites, and now, without Rafa, even less," the 12th-ranked Spaniard said.
12641	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"But that doesn't mean we can't win."
12642	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	This weekend's series is the second time the tournament will be held in Latin America, after Chile lost to visiting Italy in 1976.
12643	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Spain beat Australia in the 2000 final and then defeated the United States in 2004.
12644	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	The Spanish also made the semifinals in 1965, '67 and 2003, losing all three times to host Australia.
12645	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Argentina has reached the final twice, losing to the United States in 1981 and to Russia in 2006.
12646	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	But despite Nadal's absence, Mancini said the Argentines will be tough to beat.
12647	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"The Spanish team has very dangerous players with experience and good tennis is going to have to be played to win," Mancini said.

12649	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS 2008-11-21 20:50:47 UTC
12650	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	The president of the U.N.'s Human Rights Council said Friday members could meet next week to look at the rampant shootings, rape and looting among 1 million civilians uprooted by fighting in eastern Congo.
12651	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Worried about the Congolese caught between soldiers and rebels, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, who also serves as Nigeria's ambassador to Switzerland, plans to convene the 47-nation Geneva- based council if at least a third of its members request the session.
12652	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Uhomoibhi told The Associated Press there's "evidence of a strong will in civil society that (council) actions should be taken to address a very serious situation."
12653	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Most of the council's African and European members are discussing the possibility, he said, and more than 50 non-governmental organizations have urged such a session.
12654	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Two rights groups, Freedom House and U.N. Watch, wrote to top U.N. officials this week asking that the Human Rights Council urgently spotlight the Congo's "mass displacement, killings and sexual violence -- involving hundreds of thousands of victims, if not more."
12655	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	They asked that the council reinstate a human rights monitor for Congo who was eliminated earlier this year in a bow to Congo's government.
12656	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Uhomoibhi said more than 1 million have been displaced by the fighting.
12657	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	More than 250,000 refugees have been forced from homes in eastern Congo in recent weeks between the army and fighters loyal to rebel leader Laurent Nkunda.
12658	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Nkunda says he is protecting Tutsis from Hutus who fled to Congo after Rwanda's 1994 genocide, but critics say he is making a power grab and accuse his forces of committing multiple human rights abuses.
12659	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	Congo's army and other militias also are accused of abuses.
12660	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	The council was created in March 2006 to replace the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, often criticized as easily manipulated by nations with poor human rights records.
12661	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	The U.S. was one of the few nations that voted against creating the council, arguing that it also lacked safeguards against hypocrisy.
12662	APW_ENG_20081121.1130.LDC2009T13	The council, whose purpose is to address human rights violations, lacks any binding authority.

12664	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	MUMBAI, India 2008-11-24 14:48:14 UTC
12665	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	Shareholders in British consulting firm Axon Group PLC have agreed to accept a 650 pence ($9.78) a share cash offer from India's HCL Technologies Ltd, company officials said Monday.
12666	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	HCL chief executive Vineet Nayar said the economic downturn had only made the acquisition more attractive.
12667	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	"The deal is significantly more attractive to us today than it was yesterday," he said.
12668	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	Axon operates in defensive sectors, like utilities, where HCL doesn't have a strong presence, he said.
12669	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	Moreover, HCL was able to snap up just over 10 percent of Axon shares on the open market, at below the offer price, he said.
12670	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	Nayar said the final price of the deal -- initially pegged at 441 million pounds ($662 million) -- would be finalized pending court approval, expected Dec. 15.
12671	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	Until then, he said "there is still a possibility of a second bidder."
12672	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	The shareholder vote to accept HCL's offer was nearly unanimous, he said.
12673	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	The acquisition -- the largest by an Indian IT company -- comes at a time of difficulty for India's information technology sector, which depends heavily on U.S. financial services firms that have been hit hard by the credit crisis.
12674	APW_ENG_20081124.0603.LDC2009T13	HCL trumped an earlier offer by India's Infosys Technologies Ltd, offering to buy Axon shares at an 8.3 percent premium to the Infosys bid.

12676	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	BREMEN, Germany 2008-12-09 21:56:48 UTC
12677	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Werder Bremen beat Inter Milan 2-1 on Tuesday in its final Champions League match and secured a place in the UEFA Cup.
12678	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Goals by Claudio Pizarro and Markus Rosenberg in the second half gave Bremen its only win in Group B and allowed it to claim third place, which took the team into the UEFA Cup when the European competition resumes next year.
12679	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Zlatan Ibrahimovic pulled one back for Inter late in the game.
12680	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Bremen jumped over Anorthosis, which lost 1-0 at Panathinaikos.
12681	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Panathinaikos won the group with 10 points, while Inter, which had qualified before Tuesday's match, finished second with 8.
12682	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Bremen ended with 7 and Anorthosis with 6.
12683	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Pizarro put Bremen ahead in the 63rd minute after a sloppy Inter clearance and Rosenberg secured the win in the 81st with a low shot that beat Inter's goalkeeper Julio Cesar although he had his fingers on the ball.
12684	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Ibrahimovic, who came on at the start of the second half, scored in the 88th, curling in a shot from 20 meters (yards) out that bounced off the post into the net.
12685	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Inter coach Jose Mourinho rested striker Ibrahimovic in the first half but with Adriano, Amantino Mancini and Ricardo Quaremsa up front, his side seemed to have enough firepower to sink Bremen.
12686	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Still, Inter had only one clear chance, but Adriano's effort was spoiled by goalkeeper Tim Wiese.
12687	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Bremen, weekend by several injuries and the suspension of playmaker Diego, did not threaten much either, except for a header from close range from Pizarro that was palmed away by Cesar.
12688	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Ibrahimovic came on for Adriano at the break, but Bremen had the first chance, with Pizarro sending a volley high over the net.
12689	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Although Inter appeared to be doing only the necessary, it nearly took the lead early in the second half but Clemens Fritz cleared Nicolas Burdisso's header off line.
12690	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	With the game picking up pace, Cesar did well to parry Pizarro's strong shot from the edge of the penalty area.
12691	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Pizarro finally found the target after 63 minutes.
12692	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	A bad clearance by Inter gave Mesit Oezil some space, Cesar parried his shot but could not hold onto the ball and Pizarro tapped in the rebound.
12693	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Cesar was in trouble again after another shot by Oezil but this time the Inter defense cleared the ball.
12694	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Inter's Brazilian keeper also fumbled a shot by Jurica Vranjes but recovered the ball.
12695	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Cesar could not hold Pizarro's next powerful shot either, but he did well to turn the ball away from any Werder players.
12696	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Aaron Hunt threatened with a low shot but it narrowly missed the net.
12697	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Substitute Mario Balotelli was left unmarked at the far post of Bremen's goal in the 79th, but he headed high from close range.
12698	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Two minutes later, Oezil broke down the left wings and sent in a low ball behind the Inter defense and Rosenberg pounced to score the goal that took Bremen into the UEFA Cup.

12718	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	Addressing the crowds on Monday through a large screen from an unknown location, Nasrallah urged Palestinians to unite and sought to boost morale.

12747	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The teachers will also not be able to demand students to do pushups or frog jumps if the purpose is to punish the students, according to the reports.
12748	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Yang Yi-feng, an association official, said that in the future, there will be no such thing as a "disciplinary stand" and that the teachers will only require students "stand to reflect upon themselves."
12749	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Since the purpose is for the students to reflect upon themselves, the teachers will not need to obtain the students' consent, he added.
12750	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The Legislative Yuan approved a total ban on corporal punishment last December.
12751	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	An attached resolution also asked the Ministry of Education and the National Teachers' Association to work out guidelines on campus discipline.
12752	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The association said that after discussions over the last four months, it has mapped out details of the guidelines.

12754	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Taipei, May 27 (CNA) 05/27/07 19:41:39 (By Han Nai-kuo)
12755	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	The party primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the year- end legislative elections is already over, but former members of the disbanded New Tide Faction who have fallen into disfavor are still incensed about the way they were treated by the party's central leadership.
12756	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang said Sunday that the DPP might summon candidates who lost in the party primary to run for legislative seats in "tough electoral zones" and that a nine-member committee will meet soon to consult hopefuls.
12757	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	DPP Chairman Yu Shyh-kun endorsed the plan, saying that no-one will be ruled out.
12758	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Asked how they will respond if the party leadership decides to summon them to run in "tough electoral zones" where the odds are against DPP candidates, at least four of the "11 nemeses" within the DPP reacted with indifference or made sarcastic remarks.
12759	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Of the 11 nemeses -- reform-minded former members of the New Tide Faction who dare to criticise the party's policies -- all but one failed to be nominated to run for a legislative seat.
12760	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said the party should summon DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung to run in a tough district because of his "high caliber, competence and consistent political correctness."
12761	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng had lambasted Lin a week earlier for calling former New Tide faction members defeated in the primary "opportunists."
12762	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng said those who were branded as opportunists are unfit to be nominees in tough districts.
12763	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	"If we lose, we will be blamed for not having enough voter support.
12764	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	And if we win, the credit will go to the party central because of its successful strategy," he said.
12765	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Lin Cho-shui, a former DPP legislator-at-large who resigned from the legislature in November last year over the corruption scandal involving the first family, also said the DPP should summon party members who are not opportunists, adding that Lin would be an ideal choice.
12766	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Legislator Shen Fa-hui criticized the DPP leadership for conducting opinion polls for the primary in such a way as to exclude all supporters of the opposition Kuomintang and its "pan- blue alliance" partner -- the People First Party.
12767	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Shen and another DPP legislator, Hsiao Bi-khim, who was the victim of a smear campaign during the party primary, both questioned why the DPP would want to summon opportunists to run against KMT nominees in the year-end election if the party leadership believes they have deviated from the DPP's core values.

12779	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Taipei, June 14 (CNA) 06/14/07 21:38:24 (By Flor Wang)
12780	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	The labor participation rate of Taiwanese women has grown in recent years and now ranks 35th in the world, a government report said Thursday.
12781	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	According to analysis carried out by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), based on data compiled by the International Institute for Management Development, the labor participation rate of Taiwanese women increased to 42.45 percent last year, up from 40.45 percent in 2001.
12782	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	During the same period, Taiwan's ranking rose to 35th from 38th place, lagging behind Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, but outpacing Japan and South Korea, the report showed.
12783	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Relevant government agencies have been working on programs to help more women find employment or open their own business, so as to meet strong demand for manpower in many sectors, CEPD officials said.
12784	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Generally speaking, getting married and having children are the two major factors most affecting women's willingness to work, the officials said, adding that when sound social systems are in place, and society grants them equal rights, women will be better able to take care of their families and work at the same time.
12785	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Against such a background, the issue of how to take advantage of women's power to contribute to the workforce has been one of the focal points in the government's human resources policy, which aims to create more job opportunities for women and fully explore their workplace capabilities, the officials said.
12786	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Judging from changes during the 1980-2006 period, Taiwanese women's labor participation rates have steadily been rising, they said, pointing out that the employment rate for married women with children under six years old doubled, growing from 26 percent to 56 percent.

12789	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	A cold front will drape over Taiwan for about three days beginning Monday, bringing showers to northern, northeastern and eastern Taiwan and causing temperatures in most parts of Taiwan to drop slightly, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted in a weather forecast Sunday.

12795	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	A massive crackdown on vote-buying will be launched prior to next year's legislative election, which is expected to be hotly contested due to the implementation of a new electoral system, according to Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang.
12796	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	Lee made the remarks Monday at a seminar on the prevention of vote-buying, which was attended by senior prosecutors, investigation officials, and police officials.
12797	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	Also present at the seminar were Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin.
12798	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	Lee said that the National Police Agency under the Ministry of Interior will hand out severe punishments to police who fail to clamp down on vote-buying, while giving awards to those who make effective efforts.
12799	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	The total number of legislative seats will be halved from 225 to 113 next year, which is likely to result in a highly competitive election Jan. 12, Lee said, while expressing concerns over the possibility of worsened vote-buying practices.
12800	CNA_ENG_20070911.0035.LDC2009T13	In addition, Lee called on law enforcement officials to take a neutral stand with regard to the political affiliation of candidates, saying that the investigations should not target at any party.

12802	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Sept. 21 (CNA) 09/21/07 19:38:04 (By Lilian Wu)
12803	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	A probe into alleged misappropriation of "special allowance fund" by four heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during their services in the government and Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng will soon conclude, the Supreme Prosecutors Office (SPO) said Friday.
12804	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Chen Yun-nan, director of the SPO's Special Investigation Task Force, was responding to reports by the United Daily News that the unit's probe into use of the fund by the four DPP bigwigs -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP presidential candidate and former Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP vice presidential candidate and former Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman and former Premier Yu Shyi- kun -- are drawing to an end.
12805	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	As Weng's term will expire at the end of the month, the probe is also expected to end soon, the daily said.
12806	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Chen said that when the probe will conclude is not yet certain, although the time will come soon.
12807	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said that the SPO Special Investigation Task Force should step up its probe into suspected irregularities in the use of the "special allowance fund" by former senior government officials of the opposition Kuomintang.
12808	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Legislator Wang Sing-nan said the DPP filed a complaint with the special investigation unit in May over suspected irregularities in the use of special allowance fund by 97 central and local government officials under the previous KMT administration.
12809	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	He said that the DPP's stance has been that if the four DPP heavyweights are found to have lined their pockets with the "special allowance fund, they should be dealt with according to the law."
12810	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	But the special investigation unit should pay equal attention to the use of the fund by former Vice President Lien Chan, KMT vice presidential candidate and former Premier Vincent Siew, KMT Chairman and former Minister of the Interior Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT Secretary-General and former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, so as to convince the public of their impartiality.
12811	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	All executives holding public office are given a special allowance fund every month.
12812	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Although the money is left up to the administrative chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent without any proof of spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with receipts.
12813	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	The issue of "special allowance fund" use drew widespread attention after an investigation into the alleged misuse of such a fund by Ma Ying-jeou, KMT presidential candidate, last August when DPP Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni complained that Ma had channeled money from the fund into his private bank accounts during his two terms as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.
12814	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	The nature of the fund triggered a hot debate after Ma contended that he had no intention of breaking the law because he considered that the fund had been set aside for his discretionary use as "private money, " just as it is regarded by every other recipient of similar funds in Taiwan.
12815	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Ma was indicted in February for embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) from the "special allowance fund."
12816	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	He was acquitted of graft in the first trial Aug. 14.
12817	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors have appealed the verdict.

12822	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	He will not visit any other diplomatic allies during the visit, they added.
12823	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	The ministry is still communicating with the leaders of Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the region, namely the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu, to see if they can attend the summit in person, the officials added.
12824	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	They noted that President Chen said earlier that he hopes New Zealand can send officials to the meeting as observers.
12825	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	The ministry is also actively working to have Australia send officials as observers, they added.
12826	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	The MOFA is also communicating with the United States on the feasibility of President Chen making a stopover in Guam en route to the Marshall Islands, although the ministry is not ruling out the possibility of arranging transit stops in other locations, they said.

12832	CNA_ENG_20071009.0032.LDC2009T13	Hsieh said in the video that he was waiting for a full recovery of his foot and at the same time making use of his convalescence to ponder the nation's future and the DPP's tangled party affairs.
12833	CNA_ENG_20071009.0032.LDC2009T13	Chao said Hsieh will also reveal the results of his deliberation on important national issues once the DPP chairmanship is decided.

12849	CNA_ENG_20071204.0045.LDC2009T13	The Tsungming Tu Award was set up last year by the NSC, which then signed the "Tsungming Tu -- Humboldt Research Award Agreement" with Germany's Alexander von Humboldt (AvH) Foundation to commend outstanding academics and experts from both countries.
12850	CNA_ENG_20071204.0045.LDC2009T13	After the two winners of the first Tsungming Tu Award were commended, Lee Der- tsai, director of the Institute of Information Science of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious academic institution, was selected as the winner of the Humboldt Research Award and will go to the German city of Bonn next April for the presentation.

12863	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Panama City, April 15 (CNA) 04/16/08 16:45:45 (By Ramon Huang and Elisa Kao)
12864	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Panama's first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos extended her gratitude Tuesday to Taiwan for its contributions to several social welfare programs in Panama, including the construction of elementary schools and water conduits.
12865	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	The Panamanian first lady expressed her thanks at a ceremony at the Presidential Office during which Republic of China Ambassador Hou Ping-fu pledged funding for the projects on behalf of the ROC government.
12866	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Hou noted that the projects, which also include the construction of highways and the expansion of a football stadium, are all examples of bilateral cooperation.
12867	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Once the highways are completed, Hou said, the agricultural produce grown in rural villages can be easily transported and sold in urban areas, while the hospital that Taiwan promised to help build in eastern Panama Province will greatly benefit the poor in that area.
12868	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	According to the first lady, President Martin Torrijos will have constructed 108 elementary schools in rural areas before he steps down in August next year, which have improved significantly the level of education in poorer regions.
12869	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	As to the football stadium Rommel Fernandez in Panama City, which Taiwan has helped to expand, First Vice President Samuel Lewis said that it will be able to accommodate some 40,000 people, double the original 20,000 capacity, once the construction work is completed and be suitable for international matches.

12875	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	Taiwan, Sept. 21 (CNA) 09/21/08 21:40:51 (By Han Nai-kuo)
12876	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning Sunday afternoon for ships operating in seas south and southeast of Taiwan as Tropical Storm Hagupit intensified into a typhoon and headed northwest toward the southern tip of Taiwan.
12877	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	CWB meteorologists pointed out that as of 5 p.m. Sunday, the center of Hagupit -- the 14th storm in the Western Pacific this year -- was located about 710 km southwest of Eluanbi, Taiwan's southernmost tip.
12878	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	They said that Hagupit, which has a radius of 250 km, was moving northwest at a speed of 21 kph and is likely to change direction slightly toward west- northwest.
12879	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	It had maximum sustained winds of 118.8 kph near the center, with gusts reaching 154.8 kph.
12880	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The meteorologists also said that the CWB will not rule out the possibility of issuing a land warning soon for Typhoon Hagupit to alert residents in southern Taiwan.
12881	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	According to the CWB forecast, Typhoon Hagupit is expected to move swiftly across the Bashi Channel and reach the waters southeast of Taiwan Monday, and that Taiwan's southeast region and the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area in southern Taiwan will begin to see rain from Monday afternoon, with the storm intensifying until Tuesday.
12882	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The CWB urged people in southern Taiwan to prepare enough food and water for seven days and avoid going outdoors unless absolutely necessary in the next few days.
12883	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The storm was first spotted Sept. 14 as a tropical disturbance northeast of Guam.
12884	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	It developed into a minor tropical depression Sept. 17 as it moved toward the eastern Philippine Sea.
12885	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later and given the name Hagupit.
12886	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	It further intensified into a severe tropical storm Sept. 20 and became a typhoon a day later.

12888	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA) 10/16/08 20:48:58 (By Ruth Wang)
12889	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	A rice production plant in southern Taiwan's Tainan County is trying to promote a farming technique that replaces pesticides with ducks, plant owner Huang Li- chin said Thursday.
12890	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang said the method of cultivation allows rice fields to be playgrounds for ducks, which eat insects and apple snails that harm rice crops and whose excrement can be used as organic fertilizer.
12891	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	But since Fangjung Rice Plant launched the program to use ducks in rice farming in 2006, only six farmers have participated in it, with the total farmland using this method reaching only three hectares, Huang said.
12892	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique organic farming technique, Huang said she is trying to get produce generated under the program certified as organic produce.
12893	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She said she is confident this can be achieved within one year.
12894	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang explained that three years is the minimum time it takes for a farm's produce to pass organic examinations.
12895	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations.
12896	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	They have to grow the strain selected by the rice production plant and cannot use any pesticides or chemical fertilizers, Huang said.
12897	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production volume to quality is the most difficult part of promoting the farming technique, even though farmers know that it is a good technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.
12898	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded in 1926.
12899	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks beside their rice farms.
12900	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Three farmers who cultivate a 1.68-hectare plot of land together have had to raise about 500 ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang said.
12901	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in carrying out the mission, but found that ducks are the most effective, " Huang said.
12902	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	All produce grown on farmland using this special technique have passed pesticide tests, she emphasized.
12903	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many bugs around, they are still beneficial to farmland.
12904	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She added that having ducks in rice fields is also a good way to attract tourists to the area.

12906	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	Taipei, Nov. 16 (CNA) 11/16/08 19:41:51 (By Y.L. Kao)
12907	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	China Medical University Hospital in the central Taiwan city of Taichung celebrated its 28th anniversary Sunday with a meeting with seven visiting American cancer experts.
12908	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	At the invitation of hospital chairman Tsai Chang-hai, Karen Fields, vice president of the Global Academic Programs at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the six other experts attended the meeting to share views with their Taiwanese counterparts on issues related to treating cancer.
12909	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	Tsai said that the M.D. Anderson Cancer in Houston, ranked as the top U.S. facility for cancer care, forged sisterhood ties with the Taiwan hospital in June in an effort to introduce advanced technology for cancer diagnosis and treatment to Taiwan through the hospital.
12910	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	Cancer has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan since 1982, with the number of people dying of cancer breaking the 40,000 mark last year for the first time, according to Tsai.
12911	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	He said that reducing the threat of cancer has become the shared responsibility of the medical sector.
12912	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	Tsai also said the central Taiwan hospital set up a cancer center equipped with state-of-the-art equipment during its anniversary last year and is working hard to integrate medical resources in treating cancer.
12913	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	Noting that the agreement reached in June by the two institutions was aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation in cancer prevention and treatment and enhancing academic and teaching exchanges, Tsai said that the two institutions also agreed to hold two meetings per year between experts from both sides, with the first meeting set on Sunday to celebrate the university's anniversary.
12914	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, Fields delivered a keynote speech on how to promote prevention and treatment of cancer via international cooperation.
12915	CNA_ENG_20081117.0007.LDC2009T13	In the initial stage, the two sides will focus their cooperative efforts on the development of the new technologies for treatment of oral cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer and esophagal cancer, according to the hospital.

12918	CNA_ENG_20081126.0008.LDC2009T13	The U.S. dollar was lower against the New Taiwan dollar in early trading in Taipei Wednesday.
12919	CNA_ENG_20081126.0008.LDC2009T13	The greenback was trading at NT$33.284 at 9:45 a.m. on the Taipei Foreign Exchange, down NT$0.068 from Tuesday.
12920	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Do as We Say, Not as We've Done
12921	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
12922	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is not a large man, standing perhaps 5 feet 3 inches tall in thick soles.
12923	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But he packed a whole lot of chutzpah when he walked into the House TV gallery Wednesday to demand that the new Democratic majority give the new Republican minority all the rights that Republicans had denied Democrats for years.
12924	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``The bill we offer today, the minority bill of rights, is crafted based on the exact text that then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi submitted in 2004 to then-Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert,'' declared McHenry, 31, with 10 Republican colleagues arrayed around him.
12925	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're submitting this minority bill of rights, which will ensure that all sides are protected, that fairness and openness is in fact granted by the new majority.''
12926	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Omitted from the McHenry plea for fairness was the fact that the GOP had ignored Pelosi's 2004 request -- while routinely engaging in the procedural maneuvers that Pelosi's plan would have corrected.
12927	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Was the gentleman from North Carolina asking Democrats to do as he says, not as he did?
12928	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Look, I'm a junior member,'' young McHenry protested.
12929	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not beholden to what former congresses did.''
12930	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Anne Kornblut of the New York Times asked McHenry if his complaint might come across as whining.
12931	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not whining,'' he whined.
12932	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the Democrats' heavy-handed leadership.
12933	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But Republicans expecting Democrats to rule the House with an iron fist are likely to be pleasantly surprised: The incoming majority was having enough trouble keeping its own supporters in line.
12934	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	House Democratic leaders were giving their first news conference of the year when the session in the Cannon building was hijacked by Cindy Sheehan and other antiwar demonstrators, some wearing tie-dyed apparel and pins linking President Bush to Adolf Hitler.
12935	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Just after Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., vowed, ``We're gonna cut the interest rate in half for student loans,'' hecklers began to chant ``De-escalate!
12936	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Investigate!
12937	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Troops home now!''
12938	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``That is exactly what we're talking about,'' Emanuel said, trying to appease the protesters.
12939	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But the hecklers kept chanting, and he fled.
12940	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The Democratic leaders in retreat, Sheehan seized the microphone.
12941	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We put them back in power,'' she said of the Democrats.
12942	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Passing out a printout calling for defunding the Iraq war, Sheehan shouted: ``These are our demands.
12943	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	And they're not requests -- they're demands.''
12944	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	If Wednesday was any indication, the 110th Congress will be highly entertaining, if not terribly productive.
12945	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	So far, it's hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
12946	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The day began when House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam of Florida led fellow House GOP leaders to a news conference in a Capitol basement hall.
12947	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	At 32, he is a year older than McHenry, and several inches taller, but no less outraged by Democrats' refusal to bestow on Republicans the rights that Republicans refused to bestow on Democrats.
12948	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was covered with a layer of makeup.
12949	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're clearly disappointed,'' seconded Roy Blunt of Missouri.
12950	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm disappointed, as are some others,'' added Kay Granger of Texas.
12951	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
12952	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It fell to CNN's Dana Bash to point out the awkward truth.
12953	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``You can play back, almost verbatim, Democrats ... saying almost exactly what you all just said,'' she said.
12954	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``So is there a little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority rights?''
12955	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
12956	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were still in the majority?''
12957	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	inquired Rick Klein of the Boston Globe.
12958	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Well, I'll let Chairman Dreier speak to that,'' Putnam ventured.
12959	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Republicans must have known they'd have some explaining to do, because they scheduled back-to-back news conferences on their minority rights.
12960	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	As soon as the Putnam session ended, Granger took the elevator up three flights and joined McHenry and his cohort in the TV gallery.
12961	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Granger had not updated her talking points.
12962	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``It's very disappointing,'' she said.
12963	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights.
12964	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	McHenry unfurled excuses: ``We were not in Congress.
12965	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... I didn't have the opportunity.
12966	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... She did not put it in legislative form.''
12967	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It had all the makings of a PR debacle.
12968	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Fortunately for McHenry, the Democrats were otherwise engaged.
12969	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	An hour after fleeing the microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about ethics and the minimum wage.
12970	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Rahm, would you answer Cindy Sheehan, though?''
12971	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``An hour or so ago you had to stop your remarks because (of) Cindy Sheehan.''
12972	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What are Democrats going to do about the war in Iraq?''
12973	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.

12975	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	We was robbed?
12976	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The blogospheric fan reaction to this year's Oscar nominations included -- as always -- a flurry of what-ifs: concern for ``Dreamgirls''' lack of a Best Picture nod, for the overlooking of Sacha Baron Cohen's acting, for the absence of ``Volver'' in the Best Foreign Language Film category.
12977	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Oh, the agony, the nitpicking, the sighs.

12980	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The musical ``Dreamgirls'' led the day with eight nominations, followed by the ensemble film ``Babel'' with seven.
12981	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There were the usual suspects -- Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood -- and the surprises, like Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barraza (both nominated in the supporting actress category for ``Babel'').
12982	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There were the documentary makers who heard via pilot announcement on a commercial flight.
12983	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding hands when their film's nominations were announced.
12984	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And there was Jackie Earle Haley, a man whose more recent credits include titles such as ``Maniac Cop 3,'' who wept when the honor sank in.
12985	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, crazy day,'' said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as Ronnie the pedophile in ``Little Children.''
12986	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It started off with me pretending to sleep last night,'' he continued.
12987	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
12988	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	You got it!'
12989	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I sat up and I just hugged her and we cried for like five minutes.
12990	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
12991	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Overall, the academy dug international themes and locales, and diversity -- something it has taken a hit for in the past.
12992	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	As for ``Dreamgirls,'' it may have earned the most nominations, but it got snubbed for biggies -- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay.
12993	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	(And let's be candid: The eight nominations include three in the same category, Original Song).
12994	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The film did get nods in supporting actor and actress categories, for Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson in roles that won them Golden Globes.
12995	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In addition to Forest Whitaker, Murphy and Hudson, Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor for ``The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Djimon Hounsou for his supporting role in ``Blood Diamonds,'' putting five black actors and actresses in top categories.
12996	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Commenting on the overall diversity in nominations, Deepa Mehta, director of Best Foreign Language Film nominee ``Water,'' said, ``It just shows that it's an international year, isn't it?''
12997	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I think it's wonderful, because I think what the academy has done is acknowledge that there's a whole world of films out there.''
12998	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The front-runners in the Best Actor and Actress categories?
12999	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Brit Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II in ``The Queen'' (also a Best Picture nominee) and Whitaker as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in ``The Last King of Scotland.''
13000	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Royalty, in other words, is big.
13001	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was also some serious Americana -- in the form of ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' which took four major nominations (including Best Picture) for an indie film about a dysfunctional family en route to one of those truly red-white-and-blue events: a little girls' beauty pageant.
13002	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Extra-thick double-fudge icing'' is how producer Peter Saraf referred to the film's Oscar success, which included nods for original screenplay and supporting actors Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
13003	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris watched the announcements on TV, hands clasped together.
13004	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``This is a new one,'' Faris said.
13005	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``We've never been through something like this together, but it's better than going through it alone.''
13006	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' ``Babel'' and ``The Queen'' in the Best Picture category are ``Letters From Iwo Jima,'' Clint Eastwood's World War II film told from the Japanese perspective, and ``The Departed,'' Martin Scorsese's thriller -- the most mainstream of the big picks and the one with the biggest domestic box office, at $121 million.
13007	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The directors?
13008	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There's Scorsese, Eastwood, Stephen Frears (``The Queen''), Paul Greengrass (``United 93'') and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu (``Babel'').
13009	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Fun bits from Tuesday's announcements in Beverly Hills: Meryl Streep got her 14th Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress as the witchy boss in ``The Devil Wears Prada.''
13010	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Marky Mark -- okay, we should refer to him as Mark Wahlberg for this particular performance -- trumped Academy fave Jack Nicholson for a supporting nod in the star-studded cast of ``The Departed.''
13011	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And ``Little Miss Sunshine's'' 10-year-old Breslin could tie Tatum O'Neal in ``Paper Moon'' for the youngest Oscar winner ever.
13012	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.
13013	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Then there was the choice by the academy's screenwriters to nominate ``Borat,'' a film that was all allegedly unscripted and improvised, for Best Adapted Screenplay (the film scribes are apparently very, very confident of their future job security).
13014	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Speaking of job security, studio heads should perhaps consider backing anything -- anything, even a finger-painting tutorial -- that involves a combination of Clint Eastwood and Kate Winslet.
13015	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Eastwood is a 10-time nominee (this year both for producing and directing ``Iwo Jima'') and a four-time winner (Best Picture and director, for both ``Million Dollar Baby'' and ``Unforgiven'').
13016	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress for ``Little Children.'')
13017	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining Winslet in that category are Penelope Cruz for Pedro Almodovar's ``Volver,'' Judi Dench for ``Notes on a Scandal,'' Streep and Mirren.
13018	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In the Best Actor category, Whitaker is up against Leonardo DiCaprio -- who was nominated for ``Blood Diamond'' but was just as often mentioned for his role in ``The Departed'' -- Peter O'Toole (``Venus''), Ryan Gosling (``Half Nelson'') and Smith.
13019	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I don't think anyone is more shocked than me,'' Gosling said Tuesday, noting that ``Half Nelson'' was a smaller film ``we didn't even expect to get distribution.''
13020	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Arkin got the news that he was up for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the heroin-sniffing porn aficionado in ``Little Miss Sunshine'' while watching the sun rise over his home in New Mexico.
13021	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I guess it was the role that did it,'' he said.
13022	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It was a brilliant script and a brilliant character, and the minute I read the script I knew I wanted to do it.''
13023	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Barraza -- who is originally from Mexico -- was one of several nominees who admitted she didn't sleep the night before.
13024	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I kept thinking yes, yes, yes, and then no, no, no, like a crazy person,'' she said.
13025	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Former Vice President Al Gore's pic on global warming, ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' was nominated for Best Documentary, which means there could be -- should be -- an intersection of politics and Hollywood on the red carpet come Oscar night, Feb. 25.
13026	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I talked with Al this morning,'' said Davis Guggenheim, the film's director.
13027	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``He was really happy.
13028	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I asked him, 'So you're ready to go to the show?'
13029	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And he said, 'I'll think about it.' ''
13030	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But Guggenheim, son of the late Washington documentarian Charles Guggenheim, said sure, Al Gore will be there at the Oscars.
13031	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``The thought of him going down the red carpet is really exciting,'' he said. ''
13032	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	... And a billion people will see him, and that means that more people will see the movie and wake up to this very inconvenient truth.''
13033	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Also nominated in the documentary category were filmmakers Rachel Grady (daughter of Washingtonian James Grady, author of the novel that inspired ``Three Days of the Condor'') and Heidi Ewing for ``Jesus Camp,'' a close-up look at summer camp for evangelical Christian kids.
13034	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The twosome were flying to Santa Barbara for a screening when they heard the news.
13035	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	A flight attendant had earlier given the pilot a heads-up, and the pilot contacted a United Airlines representative on the ground, who monitored the Internet for the news.
13036	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	An hour into the flight, the pilot announced that two Oscar nominees were on board.
13037	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I'm only going to fly United from now on,'' Ewing said.
13038	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Staff writers Sonya Geis and Ann Hornaday contributed to this report.
13039	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney Directed Effort to Discredit Wilson, Former Aide Testifies
13040	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
13041	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Vice President Cheney personally orchestrated his office's 2003 efforts to rebut claims that the administration used flawed intelligence to justify the war in Iraq and discredit a critic who he believed was making him look foolish, according to testimony and evidence Thursday in the criminal trial of his former chief of staff.
13042	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney dictated talking points for a White House briefing in the midst of the controversy that summer, his former press aide, Cathie Martin, testified, stressing that the CIA never told him that a CIA-sponsored mission had found no real evidence that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa.
13043	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Aboard Air Force 2, on a trip back from the launch of a battleship in Norfolk, Va., Cheney instructed his chief of staff, Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, about responding to a Time magazine reporter who questioned how the faulty intelligence on Iraq had become one of the Bush administration's central arguments for going to war.
13044	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
13045	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
13046	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
13047	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss' instruction.
13048	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Lea Anne McBride, Cheney's current spokesperson, said Thursday evening that the vice president's office could not comment on the case or evidence introduced in the trial.
13049	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby, 56, is charged with lying to investigators and a grand jury about how the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA officer Valerie Plame, was leaked to the media days after Wilson went public with his claims that the administration had twisted his findings to justify the war in Iraq.
13050	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby has pleaded not guilty, contending he misspoke and forgot about conversations he had with journalists amid the crush of his duties.
13051	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	He is not charged with the leak itself.
13052	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin recalled telling Cheney and Libby information from CIA spokesman William Harlow that Wilson was the person sent to Niger ``and his wife works for the CIA.''
13053	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
13054	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
13055	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
13056	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney insisted that the administration had significant evidence that Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
13057	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney told Martin to alert the media that a highly classified and recent National Intelligence Estimate indicated no doubts about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium.
13058	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.
13059	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	On college rule paper, in blue ink, Martin scribbled what Cheney told her the press needed to know about the Niger controversy as they conferred in his Capitol Hill office on July 7, 2003.
13060	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``As late as last October, the considered judgment of the intel community was that SH (Saddam Hussein) had indeed undertaken a vigorous effort to acquire uranium from Africa, according to NIE (the National Intelligence Estimate),'' she wrote.
13061	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
13062	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin said that Cheney also determined the reply to questions she had received from Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper about the role the vice president's office had played in the Niger trip.
13063	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	While flying back from Norfolk on the vice president's plane, she mentioned to Libby the e-mailed questions from Cooper.
13064	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby later came to her seat in the back of the plane, holding a handwritten card with notes he said were Cheney's instructions about what to say to Cooper.
13065	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
13066	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
13067	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She said they directed her and her staff to begin monitoring television reports on the Niger trip and provide daily transcripts along with their usual canvas of printed stories about the vice president's office.
13068	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
13069	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``At no time did Vice President Cheney indicate to you that he considered Valerie Wilson part of the story he wanted to get out,'' attorney Theodore Wells said to Martin.
13070	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``I did not have a conversation with the vice president about that,'' Martin responded.
13071	LTW_ENG_20070208.0110.LDC2009T13	Hare's Play Is Ending Early
13072	LTW_ENG_20070208.0110.LDC2009T13	David Hare's ``The Vertical Hour'' will close early at Broadway's Music Box Theater because it is ``expected to recoup its entire capitalization with the week ending March 11,'' a spokesperson said Wednesday.
13073	LTW_ENG_20070208.0110.LDC2009T13	``In order to maintain that advantageous position for the play's investors, the producers will end the limited engagement three weeks earlier than originally announced (April 1).''
13074	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush Pitches Health-Care Plan in Tennessee
13075	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.
13076	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	President Bush traveled here Wednesday seeking support for his health-care proposals, taking a turn at the controls of a surgical robot at a Chattanooga hospital and praising Tennessee's effort to expand health-care coverage to the uninsured.
13077	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
13078	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer does not offer health coverage.
13079	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She said she had purchased private insurance, but dropped it last summer when she turned 35.
13080	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
13081	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Most people say 22, but thanks,'' Childress responded amid laughter from the audience.
13082	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
13083	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy Childers can better afford insurance?''
13084	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush asked.
13085	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president has proposed making medical insurance premiums deductible for all Americans, up to $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for individuals.
13086	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Currently, employers can deduct health- care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot.
13087	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses.
13088	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher.
13089	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president's proposals have gotten a frosty reception on Capitol Hill.
13090	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Democrats, who took control of both chambers of Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become more affordable for the self-employed.
13091	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	But they say that the biggest problem is the 47 million people in the United States with no health insurance, and that the president's proposal would help only a small fraction of them.
13092	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns.
13093	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Instead, they favor a tax credit for premiums, which they say would help all taxpayers regardless of their filing status.
13094	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``While the president's focus on health care is important, his proposals will only worsen the crisis by undermining the quality coverage that millions of working families now rely on, and replacing it with a tax break that will benefit the wealthiest Americans,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Wednesday in a statement.
13095	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Episcopal Leader Seeks Patience on Issues of Sexuality
13096	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church said Wednesday that it is being pushed toward painful decisions on questions of sexuality and scriptural interpretation by ``impatient forces'' eager for clarity, but urged members to wait and be without fear as the church struggles through a difficult time.
13097	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Appearing in a live webcast, the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori acknowledged that the church, the American wing of the global Anglican Communion, risks losing its place and voice in that fellowship if it does not comply with demands from Anglican leaders that it bar official blessings for same-sex couples and take other actions.
13098	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the divisive issues.
13099	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to find a way to live together,'' she said.
13100	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In a meeting that ended last week in Tanzania, the leaders, or primates, of Anglican provinces around the world issued an ultimatum to the U.S church.
13101	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	By Sept. 30, they said, the Episcopal Church must state explicitly that it will not authorize blessings for same-sex couples and will bar gay men and lesbians from becoming bishops.
13102	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a long-simmering conflict between liberal and conservative church members in the United States and abroad reached crisis when the Episcopal Church consecrated its first gay bishop, V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire.
13103	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Robinson made his first public comments on the Tanzania meeting, saying the Episcopal Church should not yield to demands that it roll back its acceptance of gays.
13104	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead, he said, it should ``get on with the work of the Gospel.''
13105	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In response, Jefferts Schori said Wednesday that such a decision was not hers to make, and that she did not know exactly where the Episcopal Church's leadership and membership stood.
13106	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	She said a clearer understanding might emerge after two upcoming meetings: a gathering this weekend of its executive council, which includes bishops, clergy and laity, and of its House of Bishops in mid- March.
13107	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	(Optional add end)
13108	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	At several points during her hour-long webcast from New York, in which she answered questions submitted by phone, e-mail and from a studio audience, she acknowledged the anguish and anxiety the conflict was causing those on all sides.
13109	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.
13110	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	One caller said her daughter, a lesbian seeking to become an Episcopal priest, was broken-hearted by the primates' demands.
13111	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori advised.
13112	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``It seems very harsh,'' the caller said.
13113	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her concerns.
13114	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	But she repeated her call for forbearance.
13115	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``We are being pushed toward a decision by impatient forces within and outside this church who hunger for clarity,'' she said.
13116	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``That hunger for clarity at all costs is an anxious response to discomfort in the face of change.''
13117	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Presidential Hopefuls Raising Funds Early and Often
13118	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
13119	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Presidential candidates are collecting contributions at a record- setting pace and are racing to load their schedules with fundraising events ahead of March 31, the campaign's first deadline for filing financial reports.
13120	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
13121	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.
13122	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days.
13123	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
13124	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
13125	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
13126	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
13127	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week.
13128	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Campaigns are also aggressively trying to manage expectations, providing low-ball estimates of what they will raise while exaggerating predictions for their opponents.
13129	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
13130	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has similarly played down his goals, with aides saying they would be thrilled with a take of $7 million to $12 million this quarter.
13131	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
13132	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	One of the great unknowns is how former senator John Edwards, D-N.C., will fare.
13133	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton and Obama (as well as Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas) must pay at least some attention to their positions in the Senate, but Edwards is unencumbered by a day job and is still riding his popularity as the vice presidential nominee in 2004.
13134	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.
13135	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	For Edwards and other Democrats seeking to catch up with Clinton and Obama -- such as Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson -- the money flow, or lack thereof, could produce a moment of reckoning.
13136	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
13137	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''
13138	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Alan Solomont, chairman of Obama's fundraising effort in New England, described the campaign's fundraising venture as a ``start-up'' that has required building from the ground up in a short time.
13139	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama is holding low-dollar ``kickoff'' fundraisers in cities nationwide, including a $100-per-ticket fundraiser in Denver and a $25-per-ticket event in Oklahoma City in recent days, and a $100-per-ticket event in West Palm Beach this weekend.
13140	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton.
13141	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
13142	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``I had thought, `Boy, this is going to be quite an effort,' not knowing how to raise money or who to even turn to, and within a couple weeks' time we had more than quadrupled my expectations in terms of what we would raise,'' said Dan Nova, 45, a first-time presidential fundraiser who held the breakfast event at his house.
13143	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
13144	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama's rivals argue that his ability to hold multimillion-dollar events in New York and Los Angeles belie the campaign's claim that his is simply a grass-roots movement without major financial players.
13145	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has stolen away dozens of Clinton fundraisers
13146	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	hired a veteran finance director, Julianna Smoot
13147	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	and signed up a talented team of Web designers at the company Blue State Digital to help power his online fundraising effort.
13148	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In the last election cycle, Blue State Digital helped former Vermont governor Howard Dean bring in a flood of low-dollar online donations that catapulted him into the spotlight.
13149	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who can roll over more than $11 million from her Senate race last year, has a huge, traditional network in place -- headed by the veteran Clinton finance guru, Terence McAuliffe -- and her husband, perhaps the party's biggest fundraising draw.
13150	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, Bill Clinton hosted a 1,000-person gala at the Sheraton in New York
13151	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	he also attended Tuesday night's event (minimum donation: $1,000) at the Marriott Wardman Park.
13152	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In between, the former president was scheduled to attend a fundraising reception, at the home of Sheila and Jay Kaplowitz in Philadelphia.
13153	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Just as she is exceeding expectations everywhere she is going politically, we'd all like to exceed expectations when it comes to fundraising,'' said Steve Grossman, a major Clinton fundraiser in Boston.
13154	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He said Hillary Clinton, like Obama, is bringing in new donors every day.
13155	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	After an intimate ``friend-raising'' dinner at the home of Elaine and Gerry Schuster in Boston in February, Clinton supporters are preparing for a much larger gathering on March 30 -- just under the wire for first-quarter filing.
13156	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaign has asked donors to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31 tally.
13157	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Both Clinton and Obama are expected to hold fundraisers in Las Vegas later this week.
13158	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In a significant change, strategists on both sides of the aisle agree, Democratic contenders could wind up with more money than their Republican counterparts.
13159	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Still, GOP benchmarks exist.
13160	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaigns of former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney have said publicly that they hope to collect $75 million to $100 million by the end of the year.
13161	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Early on, Romney impressed insiders by collecting more than $6 million in a single call-athon day in Boston, but one strategist said he has not heard much since from the former governor.
13162	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Either he's gotten all the money he's going to get or they've got so much money they don't need any more,'' the strategist said.
13163	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney is staying active on the fundraising circuit, with 20 events scheduled this month.
13164	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Romney, refused to offer a concrete goal for the quarter, adding: ``Everybody recognizes that fundraising totals should be reflective of the national polls.
13165	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In the national polls, we are in third place.''
13166	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Giuliani may have the most to gain -- or lose -- with his first- quarter showing, and he and his inner circle of fundraisers are acting like it.
13167	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	One Republican operative said that Paul Singer, a pioneer in hedge-fund investing and a Giuliani backer, is personally making calls to potential donors in New York and Washington, putting his own capital on the line to round up cash.
13168	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Allies of McCain have argued that he got a late start on raising money.
13169	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not years, before that announcement.
13170	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His first major event was on March 2 in Phoenix, and was the first in a series of ``Exchange of Ideas'' fundraisers in which the crowd is allowed to question the candidate.
13171	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
13172	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Bush, an incumbent running without significant primary opposition, raised $36 million in the first six months of 2003.
13173	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His campaign began fundraising in earnest only in early March.
13174	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Post Web Site Goofs on Headline
13175	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
13176	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Well, The Washington Post's Web site screwed up the John Edwards story, too.
13177	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	For 51 seconds.
13178	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety.
13179	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at 12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House Bid.''
13180	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
13181	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``You don't like a bad story on the Web site for one second or 51 seconds,'' said Jim Brady, executive editor of washingtonpost.com.
13182	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
13183	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Especially embarrassing because The Post reported Friday that Politico.com and Reuters, each quoting an unnamed source, had carried pieces that Edwards was going to suspend his campaign before the former senator's news conference in North Carolina.
13184	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The news was already out at the time of The Post's online screwup.
13185	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move quickly once the candidate announced his plans.
13186	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady still isn't sure how the mistake happened.
13187	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said.
13188	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was an error of production ... Nobody knows how it got up because nobody hit the publishing button,'' Brady said.
13189	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Leonard Downie Jr., the newspaper's executive editor, said he was upset that the newsroom was not notified.
13190	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``This was a big story,'' Downie said.
13191	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The fact that we had a wrong report up for 51 seconds -- even though it was unintentional -- should have been known to us in the newsroom.''
13192	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl DC.
13193	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said.
13194	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``We should have been up front.''
13195	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Fishbowl DC posted a screen shot of the erroneous washingtonpost.com headline Friday morning.
13196	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said his staff is investigating possible defects in their publishing tools to prevent a recurrence.
13197	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``At least we know we have a problem with the tool now,'' he said, ``but that's not the way I'd prefer to find out about it.''

13283	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	KUFA, Iraq
13284	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	The dramatic resurfacing Friday of powerful cleric Muqtada al- Sadr appeared carefully staged to counter claims that his hold over Shiite Muslims is weakening and to reassert his position as political kingmaker.
13285	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed.
13286	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He also instructed his militia to refrain from confrontations with Iraqi security forces, saying they should ``resort to civilian means when they are attacked.''
13287	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials in Baghdad seemed surprised by al-Sadr's return, which comes at a key juncture in Iraq.
13288	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Officials in Iraq and Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
13289	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We hope that he would take the opportunity to play a productive role,'' said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.
13290	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Members of al-Sadr's al-Mahdi militia staged two major uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004.
13291	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back.
13292	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government
13293	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	a 3-month-old security plan has made few inroads against withering violence
13294	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	and speculation is rife about how much longer U.S.-led forces will remain actively engaged.
13295	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Talks scheduled for next week between U.S. and Iranian representatives add another element of uncertainty.
13296	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Sensing the weakness of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Iraqi leaders have been positioning themselves for his possible fall.
13297	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return could signal a ``gathering of forces'' in anticipation of major changes in the Iraqi government, said Vali Nasr, an expert on Shiite politics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.
13298	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said.
13299	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``And Sadr is probably the biggest player in that because he has a large chunk of the vote, and he controls the street.''
13300	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
13301	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
13302	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
13303	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
13304	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last year, his followers were widely blamed for driving the sectarian killing that drove up the toll of Iraq's civil war.
13305	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
13306	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
13307	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
13308	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
13309	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Sheikh Salah Ubaisi, one of al-Sadr's close aides, said the cleric was trying to find a way to move the country forward.
13310	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Iraq is now facing a severe crisis in all aspects, politically, economically and security wise,'' he said.
13311	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We as a political movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
13312	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have said that al-Sadr fled to Iran ahead of the U.S. troop buildup that began Feb. 13.
13313	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Most of the cleric's followers insist he never left Iraq, though one official in his movement said Friday that the cleric had used the time out of the public eye to conduct a ``regional tour,'' which included a stop in Iran.
13314	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for the first time in more than four months.
13315	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
13316	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
13317	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice.
13318	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to Israel.
13319	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to America.
13320	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to the devils.''
13321	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his traditional black robes and turban.
13322	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``The government should not allow the occupiers to extend their stay in Iraq, not even for one more day.''
13323	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr said he stood ready to defend Sunnis and Christians who have been targeted by extremists, even as he underlined his displeasure with proposals to re-integrate members of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arab regime into the government and civil service -- one of the benchmarks for continued U.S. support.

13368	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	//Rooting for the Islamists//
13369	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	(c) 2006, Los Angeles Times
13370	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	This editorial appeared in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times:
13371	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Western observers tend to regard the political success of Islamists in the Middle East as bad news, because elections have brought to power such dangerous hard-liners as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.
13372	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Yet the strong victory of the main Islamist party in Sunday's election in Turkey -- the world's prime laboratory for an experiment in whether Islam is compatible with democracy -- was a very hopeful development.
13373	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	The ruling Justice and Development Party, known in Turkey as the AKP, won a thumping 47 percent of the vote in the parliamentary contest.
13374	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	It was a repudiation of the secular establishment that ruled Turkey off and on for decades after being put in place by Kemal Ataturk in 1923.
13375	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	This elite, which runs the judiciary and the military, threatened to undermine the country's democracy in April, when army leaders hinted that they would stage a coup if an AKP candidate whose wife wears a head scarf were elevated to the presidency.
13376	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	In Turkey it's the Islamists, or at least the liberal Islamists who head the AKP, who promote religious freedom and tolerance, while secularists' fears of a religious takeover of government institutions have prompted hysteria over matters as seemingly harmless as a scarf.
13377	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	The AKP's popularity is soaring because of measures that have tamed inflation and led to strong economic growth in just six years, and its support of Turkish efforts to become a member of the European Union has produced progressive legal reforms.
13378	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the nationalistic Republican People's Party, the party of Ataturk, opposes EU membership and favors military intervention in Iraq to discourage attacks from Kurdish separatists.
13379	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	It's still unclear whether Turkey's version of tolerant and moderate Islamic rule will spread to other Muslim countries, or even survive for long in Turkey.
13380	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	But at this point, it's a beacon for struggling democracies in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why it's in the overwhelming interest of the United States and Europe to support the newly strengthened regime of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13381	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	For the U.S., that means a renewed push to resolve the Kurdish problem diplomatically.
13382	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	For the EU, it means fighting to keep Turkey's membership drive alive.

13384	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	BURAIDAH, Saudi Arabia
13385	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
13386	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It needs someone with the courage of Martin Luther.
13387	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
13388	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
13389	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But it was reinforced by Sept. 11, 2001, and in the years since, I've only become more convinced that it is critical to Islam's future.
13390	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
13391	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for many verses -- especially those having to do with relations between Islam and other religions -- to be reinterpreted in favor of a more modern Islam.
13392	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
13393	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for Muslims to question our leaders and their strict teachings, to reach our own understanding of the prophet's words and to call for a bold renewal of our faith as a faith of goodwill, of peace and of light.
13394	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
13395	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
13396	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
13397	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
13398	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
13399	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I prayed to God to give me the strength to overcome them.
13400	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I made a deal with Him: I would give up everything, devote myself to Him and live the way the prophet Muhammad and his companions had lived 1,400 years ago if He would rid me of my doubts.
13401	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
13402	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
13403	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Viewing modern education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as they had been taught 1,200 years ago.
13404	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
13405	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1991, I took part in firebombing video stores in Riyadh and a women's center in my home town of Buraidah, seeing them as symbols of sin in a society that was marching rapidly toward modernization.
13406	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
13407	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
13408	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he create it himself?
13409	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
13410	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	By the time I turned 26, much of the turmoil in me had abated, and I made my peace with God.
13411	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
13412	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I saw Islamic judges ignoring the marks of torture borne by my prison comrades.
13413	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I learned of Islamic teachers who molested their students.
13414	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
13415	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me.
13416	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	One, written by a Palestinian scholar, was about the struggle between those who deal pragmatically with the Koran and those who take it and the hadith literally.
13417	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The other was a book by a Moroccan philosopher about the formation of the Arab Muslim way of thinking.
13418	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The books inspired me to write an article for a Saudi newspaper arguing that Muslims have the right to question and criticize our religious leaders and not to take everything they tell us for granted.
13419	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically if our religion is to survive and thrive.
13420	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
13421	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some men in my mosque refused to greet me.
13422	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
13423	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
13424	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
13425	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
13426	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	After I wrote articles stressing our right as Muslims to question our Saudi clerics and their interpretations and to come up with our own, officials from the kingdom's powerful religious establishment complained, and I was banned from writing.
13427	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
13428	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
13429	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
13430	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
13431	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I tried to give a new interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims and Christians and Jews.
13432	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
13433	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
13434	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
13435	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
13436	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban my writing.
13437	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I became a favorite target on the Internet, where my writings were lambasted and labeled blasphemous.
13438	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
13439	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
13440	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt that He was moving me toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we pray to God from the heart.
13441	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
13442	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is great.''
13443	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
13444	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
13445	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
13446	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
13447	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
13448	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
13449	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring my infidelity.
13450	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of the verse of light.
13451	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15, I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time.
13452	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
13453	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
13454	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
13455	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
13456	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
13457	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I believe that others can find it, too.
13458	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But first we need a Reformation similar to the Protestant Reformation that Martin Luther led against the Roman Catholic Church.
13459	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
13460	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his everlasting paradise.
13461	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
13462	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	he shared it only with a small, trusted circle of students.
13463	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous uprising.
13464	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.
13465	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Mansour al-Nogaidan writes for the Bahraini newspaper Al-Waqt.
13466	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Waterwitch Looks Down, Not Up, for Drought Relief
13467	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va., farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a well.
13468	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	With his leathery hands, he gripped the handles of two L-shaped copper rods, held them parallel, tucked his elbows into his ribs, puffed out his chest, marched a few paces back and forth and silently bid the earth to reveal its watery secrets.
13469	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
13470	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``There they go!''
13471	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	said the 82-year-old grandfather and former book publisher -- and part-time water witch.
13472	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Also known as dowsers, most water witches say they are born with a capacity to locate underground water by channeling its energy, or electromagnetism, or something loopy and twitchy of that kind that has yet to be named by science, through a pair of metal rods, a forked twig, a coat hanger, a pendulum or, in rare cases, acutely alert fingers.
13473	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
13474	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	A dry spell this summer has led Maryland and Virginia to seek drought relief for farmers and could prod more homeowners to turn to dowsers to find productive wells.
13475	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But well drillers today are often uneasy with the practice.
13476	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``You're going to get me in trouble,'' Bob Leazer, of Leazer Brothers Drilling and Pump Co., based in Remington in Fauquier County, Va., responded when asked if he employs dowsers to locate the wells his company drills in 13 Virginia counties.
13477	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``I've seen a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've seen 'em miss.
13478	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	And I can't say if it works.''
13479	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Some people decry dowsing as the handiwork of the devil
13480	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
13481	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Others, in the name of rational skepticism, just call it bunk.
13482	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
13483	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
13484	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
13485	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His father preferred fresh limbs cut from a cherry or willow tree, but Shirley uses brass rods to pinpoint and drill where he believes underground streams cross -- a prime location for a multigallon-per-minute well.
13486	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He will dowse only if clients permit, but nearly all do, said his wife, Jackie.
13487	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Detractors say there's no hard proof that the method works.
13488	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself ``strongly opposed'' to the practice.
13489	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Experiments have shown that the odds of finding water through dowsing are no better than random attempts and that rods lack special powers, said Cliff Treyens, the association's public awareness director.
13490	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
13491	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His company, which works on Northern Virginia projects, uses satellite imagery and seismic and geophysical tools to find potential well sites.
13492	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
13493	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Several dowsers who were interviewed said they work for free or charge a nominal fee.
13494	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting groundwater wherever one digs.
13495	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Dowsers and their supporters say that misses the point.
13496	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``You know there's water down there, but you want to hit it within short order, and you don't want to hit haphazardly,'' said Peter Holden, a Purcellville, Va., farmer who is a liaison to the Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.
13497	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He said dowsers found him plentiful supplies on three properties.
13498	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The use of twigs and rods dates to biblical times, dowsers say.
13499	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Over the centuries, practitioners uttered incantations to empower rods with divine grace to seek water and other hidden substances, from precious metals to lost cats to bad vibes.
13500	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Lore has it that the term ``water witch'' derives not from a description of a person but rather from the witch hazel branches preferred by Anglo-Scottish immigrants.
13501	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Dowsers themselves debate how to define their practice, said Arvid Johnson, operations manager of the 3,000-member American Society of Dowsers, based in Vermont.
13502	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But they agree on the need for a clear mind and sharp focus.
13503	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``It's kind of like a hammer is to a carpenter.
13504	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The hammer doesn't build the house
13505	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the carpenter does.
13506	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The rod doesn't find water
13507	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the dowser does,'' said dowser Tom Stewart, 61, of North Carolina, who recently retired as a teacher and started an online business selling his homemade rods.
13508	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain.
13509	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	By spinning clockwise for yes or counterclockwise for no, the pendulum channels a magnetism of sorts to answer questions that transcend matter, Fincham said.
13510	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On Cross's property in Clarke County's Berryville one recent day, the pendulum oscillated sharply as Fincham posed questions about water depth and flow.
13511	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Cross had called Fincham, who learned the art of dowsing at a school in Arkansas, for a second opinion about where to drill a new well.
13512	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``Relax.
13513	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Don't try to grip 'em.
13514	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Elbows by your sides,'' said Fincham, coaching his friend with the 18-inch rods.
13515	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his knack with rods, an enigma.
13516	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answers to Home-Care Questions
13517	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Question: Once in 2002, and again in 2006, I have had the wall- to-wall carpeting in my co-op professionally cleaned.
13518	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
13519	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	(By the way, I don't smell anything.)
13520	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid over a concrete slab and that's the problem.
13521	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
13522	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
13523	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What else can be done?
13524	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
13525	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
13526	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
13527	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet of floor in a 24-hour period.
13528	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, the acceptable level is 4.5 pounds or less.
13529	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
13530	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
13531	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I think you have a legitimate concern, and I would advise against installing new carpeting in your co-op.
13532	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
13533	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now, what are your options?
13534	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Well, let's assume your building is older and that the concrete has been in place for some time.
13535	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
13536	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I would suggest installing a tile floor, which will allow some moisture from the slab to rise through into the living space.
13537	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To deal with the moisture from the slab, use one or two dehumidifiers.
13538	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
13539	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
13540	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q.: I've lived in my home for 48 years.
13541	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
13542	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
13543	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
13544	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What's the truth?
13545	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
13546	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``That's too much,'' he said.
13547	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is to look for the white stones in the asphalt.
13548	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	When you can see the white stones, then it's time.''
13549	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
13550	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Hope that helps.
13551	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a problem with clover.
13552	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
13553	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Also what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
13554	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
13555	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I tend to have a lot of clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
13556	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
13557	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
13558	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told by organic experts that, depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant after a season or two.
13559	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin.
13560	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Ants don't like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
13561	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
13562	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.
13563	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks, silverfish, flies and spiders.
13564	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.
13565	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Early Clash Brewing Over Iraq Report
13566	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
13567	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senior congressional aides said Wednesday that the White House has proposed limiting the much-anticipated appearance on Capitol Hill next month of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker to a private congressional briefing, suggesting instead that the Bush administration's progress report on the Iraq war should be delivered to Congress by the secretaries of state and defense.
13568	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials did not deny making the proposal in informal talks with Congress, but they said Wednesday that they will not shield the commanding general in Iraq and the senior U.S. diplomat there from public congressional testimony required by the war-funding legislation President Bush signed in May.
13569	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``The administration plans to follow the requirements of the legislation,'' National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in response to questions Wednesday.
13570	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The skirmishing is an indication of the rising anxiety on all sides in the remaining few weeks before the presentation of what is widely considered a make-or-break assessment of Bush's war strategy, and one that will come amid rising calls for a drawdown of U.S. forces from Iraq.
13571	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before Congress.
13572	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers from both parties are growing worried that the report -- far from clarifying the United States' future in Iraq -- will only harden the political battle lines around the war.
13573	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
13574	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates would provide the only public testimony.
13575	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., told the White House that Bush's presentation plan was unacceptable.
13576	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said that ``we are in talks with the administration and ... Senator Levin wants an open hearing'' with Petraeus.
13577	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
13578	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``Americans deserve an even-handed assessment of conditions in Iraq.
13579	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Sadly, we will only receive a snapshot from the same people who told us the mission was accomplished and the insurgency was in its last throes,'' warned House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel of Illinois.
13580	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``That's all the more reason why they would need to testify,'' a senior Foreign Relations Committee aide said of Petraeus and Crocker.
13581	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
13582	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
13583	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
13584	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
13585	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	But both the White House and Congress have widely described the assessment as coming from Petraeus.
13586	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
13587	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
13588	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Several Republicans have hinted that their support will depend on a credible presentation by Petraeus, not only of tangible military progress but of evidence that the Iraqi government is taking real steps toward ethnic and religious reconciliation.
13589	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	One of them, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., left for Iraq Wednesday night with Levin for his own assessment.
13590	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
13591	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the two may not be appearing in public.
13592	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	They said they will continue to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from Washington.
13593	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``If anything, we just don't know the dates/times/or the committees that the assessment will be presented to,'' a senior military official in Baghdad said in an e-mail Wednesday.
13594	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
13595	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
13596	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
13597	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.
13598	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Government Accountability Office is due to report on Iraqi political reconciliation and reconstruction by Sept. 1.
13599	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	An independent committee, headed by retired Marine Gen. James Jones, has been studying the training and capabilities of the Iraqi security forces and will report to Congress early next month.
13600	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few weeks.

13603	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Borrowing Strategy Using Yen Unravels
13604	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	TOKYO
13605	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Investors loved it.
13606	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Central bankers worried about it.
13607	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
13608	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
13609	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Over the last 10 years, the yen carry trade -- the practice of borrowing Japanese yen at almost zero interest and using that cash to finance higher-return investments mostly outside Japan -- became a favorite speculative tool of global hedge funds and small Japanese investors alike.
13610	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
13611	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The markets have now had a real-world look at what happens when that edifice of debt unravels.
13612	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
13613	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
13614	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"Carry trades are coming unglued," said Mark Cutis, chief investment officer at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo.
13615	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"These are trades that everybody in our business knew were going to come unstuck."
13616	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much over."
13617	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
13618	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Now, the repurchasing of yen has driven Japan's currency up against the dollar -- at one point last week it was up 10 percent over its yearly low.
13619	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That kind of rise could have deep repercussions for Japan's economy.
13620	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
13621	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	A stronger yen means that Japanese exports become more expensive overseas.
13622	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.
13623	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"When volatility gets high, the carry trade does not work," said Tohru Sasaki , chief foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo, who added that the size of the trade was even bigger than the available data indicated.
13624	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But the volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it does, "the carry trade will resume."
13625	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	In Japan, the debate over the future of the carry trade is partly a quarrel over whether traditionally cautious Japanese investors have developed an enduring appetite for risk.
13626	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.
13627	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That view explains, in part, why there was a rush to convert investments back into yen last week: The currency is seen as a safe haven in times of volatile markets, and Japanese investors were with the pack that was fleeing the carry trade.
13628	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Recent surveys conducted by the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan also show that consumers here generally continue to be wary about their economic prospects.
13629	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But others contend that all the talk about the carry trade obscures a shift in attitudes among Japanese investors, who are increasingly eager to seek out foreign investments -- even risky ones -- to diversify their holdings and increase returns.
13630	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The Nikkei index was down 9 percent last week, including a 5.4 percent plunge Friday that was the worst single-day drop since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
13631	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Although Japanese stocks recovered this week (with the Nikkei recording its best two-day surge since 2004 on Monday and Tuesday), continuing market turmoil saw the yen continue to gain against all other currencies, a sign that no one was rushing back into the carry trade just yet.
13632	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"In the last 15 years, a new financial architecture has been constructed, and the results of this experience have been overwhelmingly positive for the global economy," said Jesper Koll, president of Tantallon Research Japan, part of an Asian hedge fund.
13633	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"Now we're having some market jitters, so we're getting normalization.
13634	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"We just don't know where normal i+s yet.
13635	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That's what the market is trying to find out."

13637	LTW_ENG_20070917.0007.LDC2009T13	The Washington Post has been following four members of Congress as they grapple with what to do about the Iraq war in the coming months.

13639	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	`Religious Enlightenment' Part of Detainee Reeducation Effort
13640	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has introduced "religious enlightenment" and other education programs for Iraqi detainees, some of whom are as young as 11, Marine Maj. Gen. Douglas Stone, the commander of U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, said Tuesday.
13641	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said such efforts, aimed mainly at Iraqis who have been held for more than a year, are intended to "bend them back to our will" and are part of waging war in what he called "the battlefield of the mind."
13642	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Most of the younger detainees are held in a facility that the military calls the "House of Wisdom."
13643	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense bloggers.
13644	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Such schooling "tears apart" the arguments of al-Qaida, such as "Let's kill innocents" and helps to "bring some of the edge off" the detainees, he said.
13645	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	As a result of the increased U.S. troop presence in Iraq this year, the number of Iraqis in U.S. detention has swelled from about 10,000 last year to more than 25,000.
13646	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The effort to reshape attitudes among the growing detainee population is aimed at addressing a problem that has vexed U.S. troops in Iraq for the past four years: Military detention facilities have served as breeding grounds for extremist views, transforming some prisoners into hard-core insurgents, according to military analysts.
13647	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
13648	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and interrogators help distinguish the extremists from others, he said.
13649	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some detainees are recommended for release.
13650	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If a detainee is an imperative security risk ... then I'm going to reduce that risk and I'm going to replace that destructive ideology," he said.
13651	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"And then when he's assessed to no longer be a threat, I'm going to release the detainee being less likely to be a recidivist."
13652	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Since May, Stone said, he has released about 2,000 detainees "and we've not had any coming back."
13653	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his goal is to keep those who are released from harming U.S. troops or anyone else.
13654	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"They're not going out of here unless I can feel comfortable about that," Stone added.
13655	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not doing mass releases."
13656	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other initiatives at the facilities include vocational training and basic education programs for about 7,000 detainees.
13657	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he believes his approach is "compelling because it's how you win this war, not only the one in Iraq, but the one on a greater basis."
13658	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He quoted Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi as saying that "America could win the war if they just applied the exact process that you're putting in detention to the rest of the entire nation," in Stone's words.
13659	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The 25,000 detainees now being held in U.S. facilities in Iraq include more than 820 juveniles, Stone said, most of whom are held in the House of Wisdom, which opened last month and is located at the Camp Victory military base near Baghdad's airport.
13660	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said that six additional young people had been sent to him just Tuesday, and that "the trend is towards the youth," including 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds.
13661	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He described older juveniles -- the 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds -- as "harder nuts" and said that 50 to 60 of them have been removed from U.S. detention facilities and turned over to Iraqi authorities for trial.
13662	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said that youths grow up to become insurgents by starting out as messengers, guards and even planters of makeshift bombs.
13663	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his staff members include a specialist in Islamic youth programs and he has also put together "a positive program that has been proven in Islam to actually turn the kids around to sort of reject some of these other things."
13664	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone, who speaks Arabic and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have 30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors.
13665	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also started "four very large soccer programs" aimed at young detainees.
13666	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The new religious training, Stone said, helps U.S. forces pinpoint the hard-core extremists.
13667	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I want to know who they are," he said.
13668	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"They're like rotten eggs, you know, hiding in the Easter basket."
13669	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said his staff conducts polygraph tests for detainees who promise to change after undergoing the religious training program.
13670	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We were trying to figure out if they're messing with us.
13671	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... You're not talking about radicals going to choirboys."
13672	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	But he also added that they're succeeding in countering extremists in the facilities.
13673	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We're busting them down, we're making whole moderate compounds that didn't exist before."
13674	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone described a sort of religious insurgency that occurred at one detention facility on Sept. 2.
13675	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We had a compound of moderates for the first time overtake ... extremists.
13676	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	It's never happened before.
13677	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Found them, identified them, threw them up against the fence and shaved their frickin' beards off of them.
13678	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... I mean, that is historic."
13679	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Jack Holt, the spokesman for the Pentagon's new media operations, said that 60 people were invited to join the Stone interview Tuesday but that only four bloggers did so.
13680	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Of those four, at least two appear to be active-duty military, but as of Tuesday evening none so had discussed Stone's presentation online.
13681	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other elements of Stone's program are being developed.
13682	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he has created a "transition-out barracks" where detainees being released discuss civics and human rights.
13683	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also begun a "huge, expensive" Rand Corp. research study on detainee motivation and morale and has plans for a major communication campaign.
13684	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he also wants to provide jobs for released detainees.
13685	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not naive," Stone said.
13686	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If they don't have any income, they're going to go back" to the insurgency.
13687	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Staff writers Joshua Partlow in Baghdad, Karen DeYoung and Rachel Dry contributed to this report.
13688	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Struggling With War Stress, Veteran Lives Day to Day
13689	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle Turner's husband sits in the recliner with the shades drawn.
13690	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew.
13691	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the phone in the other room, Michelle is pleading with the utility company to keep their power on.
13692	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?"
13693	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	asks her husband, Troy, who served as an Army scout in Baghdad and came back with post- traumatic stress disorder.
13694	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Troy, they don't care," Michelle says, her patience stretched.
13695	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government's sweeping list of promises to make wounded Iraq war veterans whole, at least financially, has not reached this small house in the hills of rural West Virginia, where one vehicle has already been repossessed and the answering machine screens for bill collectors.
13696	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
13697	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After revelations about the poor treatment of outpatient soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center earlier this year, President Bush appointed a commission to study the care of the nation's war-wounded.
13698	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The panel returned with bold recommendations, including the creation of a national cadre of caseworkers and a complete overhaul of the military's disability system that compensates wounded soldiers.
13699	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But so far, little has been done to sort out the mess of bureaucracy or put more money in the hands of newly disabled soldiers who are fending off evictions and foreclosures.
13700	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the Turner house, that leaves an exhausted wife with chipped nail polish to hold up the family's collapsing world.
13701	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
13702	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But since Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
13703	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
13704	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You need two college degrees to understand any of it," she says, lacking both.
13705	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
13706	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A psychotic Vietnam vet she met in a VA hospital was the one who told her that Troy might be eligible for Social Security benefits.
13707	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or randomly explosive.
13708	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
13709	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
13710	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't make decisions.
13711	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is a worrywart.
13712	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Fearful.
13713	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's like they took Troy and put him in a different person."
13714	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	As thousands of war-wounded lug their discharge papers and pill bottles home, more than a quarter are returning with PTSD and brain trauma.
13715	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Compensation for these invisible injuries is more difficult and the social isolation more profound, especially in rural communities where pastures outnumber mental health providers.
13716	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's one-year war has become his wife's endless one.
13717	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live in a small rental house in the northern tip of West Virginia, surrounded by enormous blue sky and the dark spine of South Branch Mountain.
13718	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	There is a VFW tavern in town, but Troy doesn't bother.
13719	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After one of his distraught soldier buddies from Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy stays away from alcohol.
13720	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, the techniques he learned to calm his PTSD in Army and VA treatment programs -- tai chi meditation and classical music -- seem like distant remedies in this county of farm equipment and Ford pickups.
13721	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle thinks Troy's anxiety and depression are worsening, and she tells anyone who will listen -- her pastor, doctors and counselors at VA.
13722	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His speech is sometimes soupy from mood stabilizers.
13723	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The meds give him tremors.
13724	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He used to cut the grass and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a perpetual patient.
13725	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle for everything.
13726	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?"
13727	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	he asks one day.
13728	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle takes a breath.
13729	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Orthopedic," she says.
13730	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Troy, (ital) please try."
13731	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(end ital)
13732	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At 31, her eyes are hollowed by worry and her brown hair is turning gray.
13733	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
13734	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The all-day journey requires a babysitter for the kids -- ages 10 and 11, both from previous marriages -- and burns $25 worth of precious gas.
13735	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
13736	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	One hot morning, they set out for Martinsburg yet again.
13737	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury -- he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital wants him back for more comprehensive testing.
13738	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy and Michelle are quiet on the ride into Martinsburg.
13739	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Bible rests on the back seat.
13740	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two- lane highway.
13741	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's pill box is between them, along with the silence.
13742	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Finally Troy says he thinks his new medication is making him less aggressive.
13743	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
13744	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You don't have an `off' button anymore," she says.
13745	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy, in the passenger seat, keeps his eyes on the road.
13746	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They broke it off when I was over there."
13747	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
13748	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before that, he spent a decade with the National Guard, pulling a tour in Bosnia.
13749	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A laconic country boy with a plug of tobacco in his cheek, Troy was a cavalry scout with the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment that pressed into Baghdad.
13750	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
13751	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's problems started after his tour.
13752	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While he was on home leave from Fort Stewart one weekend, Michelle found him sitting on the bed with a bottle of pills.
13753	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he couldn't go back.
13754	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle drove him to the Martinsburg VA hospital, which shipped him to Walter Reed for three weeks of psychiatric care.
13755	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He was sent back to Fort Stewart and returned to duty, a reality he could not cope with.
13756	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
13757	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
13758	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
13759	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.
13760	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship, she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat her well.
13761	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
13762	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
13763	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
13764	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His family needed the $2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in the truck with him.
13765	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Finally VA doctors increased Troy's medication, and he became too zonked to drive.
13766	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA rated Troy's disability level at 50 percent, resulting in $860 a month in compensation.
13767	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Like many wounded soldiers, he was clobbered by a fine-print government regulation known as "concurrent receipt," which prevents double compensation.
13768	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	That meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army.
13769	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 13 months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was reimbursed.
13770	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners' foothold in working-class America completely slid away when Michelle -- who has worked as a teacher's aide and an inventory-control specialist at Wal-Mart -- developed health problems and was forced to quit her job.
13771	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
13772	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His illness has eroded their marriage, but on the morning they arrive at the Martinsburg VA hospital, she leads the charge on his behalf.
13773	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The concrete behemoth serves 129,000 vets from West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
13774	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
13775	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle and Troy move down the hallways, passing a room near the PTSD residence where a group of young vets, some tattooed and still muscled from the desert, are playing a game of ring toss.
13776	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cafeteria smells of bleach and canned peaches.
13777	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the small lobby of the neuropsychological department, Troy leans over the sign-in clipboard, pen in hand, staring at the sheet.
13778	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle tells him what day it is.
13779	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They sit together on the hard chairs until Troy's name is called.
13780	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	With two hours to kill, Michelle wanders into the hallway and runs into a Vietnam vet she has befriended.
13781	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A former Marine with ramrod posture, the vet has PTSD and an encyclopedic knowledge of VA procedures.
13782	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
13783	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Huntington (a VA regional office) says you are his fiduciary, right?"
13784	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle says.
13785	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
13786	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't let these people get over on you!"
13787	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She returns to the waiting room.
13788	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
13789	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A door opens, and one of Troy's doctors asks her to step into his office.
13790	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse.
13791	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
13792	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
13793	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in again.
13794	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She knocks on the door of a counselor, a big, bald, friendly man who does not wave off the intrusion.
13795	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You think he's violent at this point?"
13796	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.
13797	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle dodges the question.
13798	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He's not getting any counseling," she says, leaning against the door.
13799	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The counselor explains that all 50 beds in the program are full and the waiting list is 25 deep.
13800	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
13801	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle's voice breaks.
13802	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I know you are doing the best you can," she says.
13803	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anymore, he's just ashamed.
13804	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	I wish I had a video camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an average day looks like."
13805	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests.
13806	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
13807	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He tells Michelle how hard he tried, and she smiles and touches his arm.
13808	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They go upstairs to make an appointment with Troy's psychiatrist.
13809	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately the doctor is on leave for the next month.
13810	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The first available slot is five weeks out, at 8:30 a.m.
13811	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
13812	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
13813	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have a three-hour drive."
13814	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Nine o'clock is the they best they can do.
13815	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
13816	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office on the first floor.
13817	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government has promised to care for its wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this, where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage reimbursed.
13818	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977.
13819	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is still paid 11 cents a mile.
13820	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
13821	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
13822	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the way home, Michelle pulls into a Flying J truck stop, pumping gas in the hot breeze, watching the numbers spin higher.
13823	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Money became so desperate this spring that Michelle contacted Operation Homefront, a national organization that gives emergency assistance to deployed service members and the returning wounded.
13824	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In a sign of the deepening financial crisis faced by many back from war, Operation Homefront has provided $2 million in bailout funds to 4,300 families so far in 2007, double last year's caseload.
13825	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.
13826	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they had no other choice.
13827	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The $860 VA disability check barely covers expenses.
13828	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has been pushing to have VA re-evaluate Troy in hopes of getting his disability rating raised and his compensation increased.
13829	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function without her.
13830	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
13831	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
13832	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.
13833	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But at least now she has the help of an assistant officer with the West Virginia Division of Veterans Affairs in a little office in Moorefield, about 30 miles from Romney.
13834	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
13835	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is "chronic and severe."
13836	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle gets copies of the medical records and sits down with them on her living room floor.
13837	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Wearing an Army T-shirt that says "Got Freedom?"
13838	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	she begins reading.
13839	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The documents are a gold mine of information that validate what she has said all along.
13840	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels sickened.
13841	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(begin ital)
13842	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has nightmares frequently, two to three times a week, in which he sees himself back in Iraq ... and Baghdad.
13843	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He sees himself fighting, sees dead bodies, parts of bodies, blood rushing from bodies.
13844	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he hears bullets passing over his head.
13845	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is fearful and scared and wakes up in cold sweats.
13846	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Flashbacks are also frequent, 2 or 3 times a week, triggered by helicopters passing over, burn flesh smell, barbecue, current Iraq news and sometimes seeing military vehicles brings flashbacks.
13847	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(end ital)
13848	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle goes page by page.
13849	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is in his recliner holding the remote control.
13850	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From time to time she looks up at him, then her eyes go back to the records.
13851	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(begin ital)
13852	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has a lot of guilt feelings that he could not save his sergeant.

13854	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She comes to a page that lists Troy's problems.
13855	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(begin ital)
13856	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Hearing loss.

13859	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	PTSD.

13862	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle calls out to Troy.
13863	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They are saying your memory is extremely low," she says.
13864	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"And here's another thing.
13865	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	`Hearing loss.
13866	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
13867	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA concludes that Troy's worsening condition merits an increase of his disability rating to 70 percent, raising his monthly check to $1,352 a month.
13868	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	According to VA, he doesn't meet the criteria for 100 percent because his impairment is not "persistent," with "persistent delusions" or a "persistent danger of hurting himself or others."
13869	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is still able to perform his own hygiene.
13870	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From Michelle's point of view, Troy can hold a toothbrush, but he can't hold a job.
13871	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
13872	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She has a year to appeal the rating.
13873	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
13874	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
13875	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
13876	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.
13877	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
13878	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	During the intake session in Martinsburg, he is withdrawn and sullen.
13879	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
13880	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The news punches Michelle in the gut.
13881	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is allowed to come home on weekends, so Michelle makes the four-hour round trip to pick him up on the first Friday night.
13882	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
13883	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
13884	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
13885	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy returns to his recliner.
13886	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA tells Michelle that a contract counselor who visits rural counties will be in touch to schedule time with Troy.
13887	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
13888	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
13889	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners decide to pack up and leave their $475-a-month rental house for a $450-a-month mobile home in Moorefield to save money and be near Troy's mother for help.
13890	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They are strained beyond belief.
13891	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, there are moments of gallows humor.
13892	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
13893	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy kids Michelle.
13894	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
13895	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
13896	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy declines.
13897	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
13898	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he says.
13899	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle raises an eyebrow.
13900	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's still an injury."
13901	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
13902	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Plus, the fact that guys are missing arms and have bullet holes and everything else.
13903	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Ain't a scratch on me."

13909	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Children's Cold Remedies Raised Questions for Years
13910	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
13911	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a pediatrician and father of two young boys.
13912	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Kids with colds were getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either effective or safe."
13913	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
13914	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The case has also raised many questions: How could the products remain on the market for so long without proof they work?
13915	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
13916	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the medical establishment warn parents?
13917	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
13918	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
13919	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
13920	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to children that have never been tested in children," Michael Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
13921	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
13922	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group.
13923	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You're just left scratching your head about how this could go on for so long."
13924	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the market before government requirements for stringent testing, and it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in children.
13925	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had authority to regulate them closely.
13926	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
13927	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
13928	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
13929	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The over-the-counter drug review was never made a priority in the agency, and so it dragged on for years and years."
13930	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
13931	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
13932	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
13933	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"At that point in time, it was felt that was the best level of evidence we could have," said Marsha Rappley, a professor of pediatrics at Michigan State University who co-chaired last week's panel.
13934	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"We now understand that we can organize studies in children and don't have to extrapolate from adults.
13935	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But that wasn't the case back then."
13936	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were made for children and the products never again received any kind of detailed scrutiny.
13937	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions.
13938	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Journal of the American Medical Association published an analysis in 1993 that concluded there was no good evidence the medications worked.
13939	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a similar conclusion in 2004.
13940	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
13941	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Where do parents get a lot of their information?
13942	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	If you are a desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and your kid has a cold what do you do?
13943	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
13944	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The American Academy of Pediatrics adopted a policy in 1997 stating cough products were ineffective, and the American College of Chest Physicians produced a similar statement in 2006.
13945	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But other groups, such as the American College of Family Physicians, never issued any formal guidance to doctors, and no major medical groups ever officially questioned the class of products or campaigned against their use.
13946	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I think there was a vacuum in leadership on this issue by the professional societies," Lurie said.
13947	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
13948	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Some experts defend the medical groups, saying policy statements from doctor groups can only do so much, especially against the aggressive marketing by large pharmaceutical companies, which spend more than $50 million a year to sell the products.
13949	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"For the past 25 or 30 years we've been warning about violence on TV," said Snodgrass, who also chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on drugs.
13950	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"What has that done?
13951	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In this case we're up against multibillion-dollar industry.
13952	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The American Academy of Pediatrics is not a multibillion-dollar industry.
13953	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	We try to do what we can, but there's only so much we can do.
13954	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where are the companies in this?
13955	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
13956	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But Sharfstein and others wonder whether the medical profession could have been more aggressive.
13957	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"When I was trained as a pediatrician it was just accepted that these products had no role.
13958	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
13959	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a fair question why there wasn't a strong regulatory challenge by the profession.
13960	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	They could have justified one.
13961	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But what really stunned us was that this was never really looked at from the legal-regulatory side."
13962	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Using powers it received from two new laws, the FDA has begun demanding some prescription drugs be tested in children before being approved, and it has enticed drug companies to conduct pediatric studies of those already on the market.
13963	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
13964	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
13965	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The FDA is now reviewing last week's recommendations, but because of the history of the products it says any formal action could take years.
13966	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers to organize studies of the products.
13967	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The industry has voluntarily withdrawn products designed for children younger than 2, but it maintains that the remedies are both safe and effective for older children when used properly, blaming the problems primarily on overdoses.
13968	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"If the industry decides to dig in its heels against the clear guidance of the advisory committee I hope the FDA has the ability to stop them," Sharfstein said.
13969	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a very small risk, unquestionably.
13970	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But if you don't have evidence that the products work and you have kids who have died from taking them, I don't think there's a role for them."
13971	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	A leader for Lebanon
13972	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The bewildering crisis in Lebanon has taken another perplexing twist with reports that the gridlocked parliament has agreed to choose the country's top general, Michel Suleiman, as its next president.
13973	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The question is whether Suleiman represents a genuine compromise among Lebanon's intractable factions or whether his ascension would signal a betrayal of the 2005 "Cedar Revolution," which ended in the promise to kick Syria out of Lebanese politics and give real democracy a chance.
13974	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The presidential selection process has been anything but free or fair.
13975	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Under Lebanon's tortured constitution, parliament chooses the president.
13976	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the power balance in parliament isn't based on election results
13977	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	rather, it tracks the tally of assassinations.
13978	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	After four anti-Syrian lawmakers were murdered, their colleagues have been holed up since September in the Phoenicia Hotel in Beirut, trying to hang on to their slim parliamentary majority by the simple expedient of staying alive.
13979	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	President Emile Lahoud's term expired last week, and Lahoud left office with no successor in sight.
13980	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The vote to replace him has been delayed six times and is now scheduled for Dec. 6.
13981	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The United States and France have supported the pro-democracy movement that drew more than a million people into the streets in the Cedar Revolution that succeeded in driving Syria from Lebanon in 2005.
13982	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the West has not done enough since then to keep Syria or Hezbollah from paralyzing political progress.
13983	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Hezbollah's punishing war with Israel, its rapid rearmament and its successful intimidation of parliament have proceeded apace, while the United Nations tribunal charged with investigating the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has dragged.
13984	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Now Beirut's beleaguered moderates fear that the West is once again willing to turn a blind eye to Syrian meddling in Lebanon if Damascus will participate in Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
13985	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Peace in the Golan Heights would be a prize, but giving radical Islamists veto power over the Lebanese government would be a tragic price to pay in return.
13986	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Enter Suleiman, who is no white knight but who might be able to keep Lebanon from a new civil war.
13987	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Originally handpicked by the Syrians, Suleiman refused to use the army to crush pro-democracy demonstrators.
13988	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	He became a national hero for routing a radical faction that had seized control of a Palestinian refugee camp.
13989	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Yet he enjoys close ties to Hezbollah and, as army chief, has allowed the smuggling of weapons from Syria to the Islamist fighters.
13990	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	In truth, a leader opposed by Hezbollah cannot control Lebanon today or prevent renewed civil strife, and the West will probably recognize Suleiman.
13991	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But it should not allow Lebanon to again become ground zero in a proxy war sponsored by Syria and Iran.
13992	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Islam Is on the Rise in Repressed Tunisia
13993	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The siblings' chain-reaction quest for holy war was ignited in 2003, when Qabil Nasri, a tall man with a sparse beard, was imprisoned on terrorism charges.
13994	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	His case radicalized his siblings, two of whom were arrested after sneaking into neighboring Algeria to train with Islamist militants.

14000	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Women enjoy a degree of liberation, men in suits have their shoes polished while reading newspapers on the sidewalks -- and secret police slip in and out of lives like uninvited guests.
14001	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Decades of stifled religious and political freedoms have ignited two trends: an underground radicalism producing militants willing to wage jihad in Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe, and a more moderate, yet potent, religious yearning that can be seen in the increasing numbers of beards and head scarves in cafes and on university campuses.
14002	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nasri brothers and thousands of young Tunisians like them epitomize the intersection of ideological currents and technological wizardry fueling Islamic extremism across North Africa.
14003	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Raised under the repression that has long defined their nation, and outraged by the Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the brothers turned to satellite television and the Internet, where they found provocative mullahs and subversive Web sites beyond the reach of government censors.
14004	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"A young man cannot find true Islam in state-sanctioned religion," Nasri said.
14005	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"So a young man, with all his power, starts searching for messages on TV and the Internet.
14006	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... Young Tunisians are peaceful, but when we face pressures because we are religious, our thoughts start to change.
14007	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Why are we subjected to this?
14008	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Why are they attacking my religion?
14009	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Eventually, a young man starts to think that his government is the enemy of Islam."
14010	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A Tunisian government official, who asked not to be named, acknowledged the rise in extremism, the dangerous prospect of battle-hardened Tunisian Islamic militants returning from Iraq and what he described as the "Internet seepage" of radical Islam.
14011	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's a great concern for all North Africans," he said.
14012	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"But these Islamist militants don't have the appeal of the Islamists of decades past.
14013	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They're a very radical sub-phenomenon.
14014	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They are influenced by radical organizations that operate across borders.
14015	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	But our security forces are ready.
14016	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	We are careful and vigilant."
14017	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A Western diplomat who requested anonymity said, "I think the Tunisians are beginning to wake up.
14018	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They used to see it as a blip: `Let these young guys go to Iraq -- what do we care?'
14019	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	But now they're dealing with these guys coming home."
14020	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2005, about 300 Tunisians were jailed for religious-inspired militant activity.
14021	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In the past year, that number has jumped to 2,000, mainly the result of a new Anti-Terror Law that has security forces scouring mosques and mountain crevices for suspected radicals, said Samir Ben Amor, a lawyer in Tunis, the capital, who represents dozens of alleged extremists.
14022	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	This year, police killed more than 20 militants in a series of gun battles in a suburb of the capital and in mountains near the Algerian border.
14023	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The extremists, including Tunisians and a Mauritanian, were part of a group that trained in Algeria and allegedly was planning attacks on the U.S. and other Western embassies in Tunis.
14024	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Algerian connection was another indication of affiliations forming among militants across North Africa, most notably around the Algerian-based Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known by its French initials, GSPC.
14025	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The mobilizing passion for many young Tunisian Islamists is the Iraq war and the perception that their nation is a proxy in Washington's wider battle against the Muslim world.
14026	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Defeating U.S. interests in Iraq and Afghanistan, their thinking goes, would weaken the regime of Tunisian President Zine el Abidine ben Ali, whose 20 years in power have been marked by frequent criticism from human-rights groups over torture, random arrests and other harsh tactics of security forces.
14027	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"Despite the Tunisian government's attempts to ban the veil, beards, and to jail Islamists, there's a religious revival in the nation.
14028	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The veil has swept the streets, and the Islamists are here," Ben Amor said.
14029	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"Ninety-five percent of Islamist terror- related cases involve young people who only started praying two to three years before their arrests.
14030	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Government oppression at home and the Iraq war have turned them into time bombs."

14033	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The younger, Marwen, was studying business at a university when he left to fight in Iraq, where he died in Fallujah in 2004.
14034	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The older, Maher, was an engineering student whose college ID card was confiscated by police, who told him he wouldn't get it back until he shaved off his beard.
14035	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He is now serving a 10-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist organization.
14036	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed mourns her sons less than she celebrates what they have done.
14037	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"Our government doesn't have any sovereignty.
14038	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	It does the work of the Americans and the Zionists," she said.
14039	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The religious resurgence is much stronger here than it was in the 1990s.
14040	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	This new movement includes the rich and the poor, the rural and the city, and the religious and those who had not been religious before.
14041	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"My sons were depressed at Friday prayers and by the sermons they heard from government-controlled preachers.
14042	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They looked for the true version of Islam on TV, the Internet and in banned books."
14043	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed sat next to another mother, Noura Ben Slimene, whose pale, angular face seemed to glow against a black hijab.
14044	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Her son, Anas, fought with the insurgency in Baghdad and died, she said, in a U.S. airstrike along the Iraqi-Syrian border.
14045	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"He came to me and said, `I'm going to Iraq.
14046	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I need my passport.
14047	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I'm prepared to do this for God,' " Slimene said.
14048	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"I felt the same way about the injustice he saw.
14049	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I was convinced he was going to fight injustice.
14050	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... In the neighborhood where I live, the police arrest many people who feel like my son."
14051	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed gathered her pictures, and she and Slimene walked down a drizzly side street and into the gaze of President Ben Ali, whose image hovers on billboards and posters across the city.
14052	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ben Ali is everywhere, Tunisians say, in their neighborhoods, on the coastal cliffs, at the desert's rim, even in the ancient city of Carthage, where whitewashed homes with blue shutters look out into the haze at yachts and tankers crossing the Mediterranean.
14053	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Violence in the 1980s and early '90s prompted Ben Ali's government to arrest hundreds of Islamists and crack down on religious organizations, including the Nahda movement, whose leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, lives in exile in Britain.
14054	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The government licensed mosques, banned religion-influenced political parties and stripped national identity cards from 10,000 to 15,000 suspected radicals.
14055	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Human-rights groups complained that the measures violated religious freedom.
14056	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The radicalism today is the result of Tunisia not allowing even moderate Islam to exist," said Ali Larayedh, a member of Nahda who spent 14 years in prison.
14057	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"But this radicalism is not a large part of the Islamist revival we're seeing in Tunisia.
14058	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... The government is exaggerating the radical threat to justify the blockade it imposes on Islam."
14059	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A young man with a receding hairline sat in a wind breaker, his hands nervously folded.
14060	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He would give his name only as Abdel.
14061	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2003, he was one of six men and boys charged with downloading subversive Internet files and trying to make a bomb in the southern town of Zarzis.
14062	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He was 17 when he went to prison and 20 when he was freed.
14063	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The case became a national sensation, pitting a government wanting to show it was fighting terrorism against critics who claimed security forces were exaggerating Islamic threats and making arrests to impress the United States.
14064	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The police said I was a Salafi, a radical.
14065	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I didn't know what Salafi meant back then," Abdel said.
14066	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"I was tortured.
14067	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	My face was paralyzed for a while.
14068	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I signed some papers confessing to things, but I don't really know what I signed.
14069	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The police still follow me.
14070	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I've noticed young Tunisians have changed a lot since I went into prison.
14071	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They have gone to either radical Islam or criminal delinquency."

14075	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	the fields were muddy, and the lake, separated from the Mediterranean by a rim of hills, was still.
14076	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Greeks and the Phoenicians sailed these waters centuries ago.
14077	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Then came the French and the Soviets, but the shipyards and the steel mill are not as busy as they once were, and young men gather in clumps at the Cafe Flamenco.
14078	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	There was no coffee-shop idling for Nasri.
14079	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2003, he crossed Tunisia's rugged terrain and was arrested at the Algerian border, where he was charged with belonging to a terrorist group.
14080	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He said he wanted to fight with the Palestinians, but police said the leaders of his group were planning terrorist attacks in Tunisia.
14081	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Nasri has remained defiant.
14082	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Because his young face wears a light beard, most employers, under government pressure, will not hire him.

14089	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q and A: Fashion
14090	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Excerpts from a recent Washington Post online reader chat with Suzanne D'Amato, deputy editor for The Post's Sunday Source, and Janet Bennett, washingtonpost.com fashion and beauty editor.
14091	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I've been trying to find a large, roomy leather tote for carrying to work, but I am debating if it's really worth the back pain for such a heavy load.
14092	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is the large tote trend going to die down this spring?
14093	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
14094	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
14095	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Do you want to carry magazines, files, bottled water and gym clothes with you every day?
14096	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Then a big tote is essential.
14097	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If not, a smaller bag might be right for you.
14098	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	The gargantuan bag (a la Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you need a big bag I say go for it.
14099	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	One thing to note in the back pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their design.
14100	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it -- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for my back, even when empty.
14101	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	So it's best to buy these in person.
14102	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I currently bring a Manhattan Portage bag ... I feel like the bags are from the 90's.
14103	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	But I'm at a loss for a replacement bag that I can wear over my shoulder and across my chest, yet still fit in my lunch, a book, my iPod, phone, etc., etc.
14104	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Tips?
14105	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Nothing wrong with Manhattan Portage, but I understand why you're ready to upgrade.
14106	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I saw some great leather (or maybe they were pleather?)
14107	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	messenger bags at Target.
14108	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	They cost $30 to $40 each and were nice and roomy, with some cool, understated hardware that distinguished them from the pack.
14109	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'd also suggest scouring the men's furnishings dept at department stores -- they often stock more of these styles than ladies' bag departments.
14110	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: Four of us girls (late 20s and early 30s) are going to ... (the ballet) on a Saturday night.
14111	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Some of them want to get really dressed up, but I'm trying to convince them that if we show up in long dresses, we'll probably be outnumbered.
14112	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A( Kelly): I would advise against wearing a long dress.
14113	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	It's just not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.
14114	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I'm wearing a Nicole Miller leopard print dress to a cocktail party.
14115	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Would you suggest I wear a pashmina or jacket to ward off the chill?
14116	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Also, should my accessories be understated and neutral, like golds and browns?
14117	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'm also wondering about bare legs this time of year.
14118	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Should I wear Spanx and closed-toed shoes, or are open-toed sandals (gold) acceptable?
14119	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
14120	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	1.
14121	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A cropped jacket of some sort would be more chic than a pashmina, which is a perfectly acceptable but not terribly fashion-forward choice.
14122	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.
14123	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	2.
14124	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, matte bronze or even dark burgundy would look great here.
14125	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If you choose gold, make sure it's nothing too sparkly-bright.
14126	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	3.
14127	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
14128	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	And if this weather keeps up, they'll be practical, too!
14129	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I recently purchased a long, black, boyfriend-style cardigan ... (that) ends about two inches above my knee with buttons going down the front and has three-quarter-length sleeves.
14130	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
14131	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): You could try a dress if it's a slinky, Calvin Klein/Helmut Lang-type sheath style, cut from a thin T-shirt fabric.
14132	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look lumpy under the cardigan.
14133	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Alternately, I'd try wearing the cardigan as a dress on its own, or layering it over skinny jeans.
14134	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital) last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.
14135	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Congestion Pricing: Transportation Department's Plan to Cut Flight Delays Is a Short-Term Fix
14136	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
14137	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
14138	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
14139	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
14140	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	But this short-term fix is not enough.
14141	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Upgrading the air traffic control system is the real solution to America's air-travel woes.
14142	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
14143	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In announcing the policy, the Transportation Department noted that the number of arrival delays exceeding one hour there increased by 114 percent in the first 10 months of fiscal 2007.
14144	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
14145	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
14146	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
14147	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
14148	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
14149	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The incentive for airport operators is that they can factor into their fees the reasonable costs associated with runway and other facility improvements that would ultimately aid in reducing delays.
14150	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.
14151	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In slamming the department's proposal, Air Transport Association President James C. May made the good point that the plan "does nothing to fix the primary cause of delays: our nation's increasingly antiquated air traffic control system."
14152	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Federal Aviation Administration has been waiting for nearly a year for Congress to fund a state-of-the-art satellite navigation system that would allow pilots and controllers to use air space more efficiently.
14153	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	A dogfight among the various interests over how to pay for it is bogging things down.
14154	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It's time Congress resolved it.
14155	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	At Least 7 Die in South Beirut Gunbattle
14156	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 28
14157	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	At least seven civilians were killed Sunday evening during an hourslong clash between Lebanese soldiers and young Shiite Muslim men protesting electricity cuts, security officials said.
14158	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	A dozen or more people were wounded in the melee when gunfire erupted as demonstrators were throwing rocks and fireworks at a phalanx of troops.
14159	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Several residents in an adjacent Christian neighborhood were injured by a hand-grenade explosion, Lebanese television reported.
14160	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence came two days after a massive car bomb killed one of the country's top intelligence officials and 12 days after another explosion struck a U.S. Embassy convoy, killing three civilians.
14161	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Fouad Siniora declared Monday a day of national mourning and ordered universities and schools closed.
14162	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"In these moments, our country is passing through its most difficult and dangerous times," he said.
14163	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence was the latest sign of deteriorating security in a country that has been paralyzed by a political standoff between two camps, one favoring the West and the other backed by Iran and Syria, over the formation of a new government.
14164	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The fighting erupted near the southern Beirut neighborhood of Ain al-Roumaneh, site of a 1975 massacre of Palestinians that helped spark a 15-year civil war in Lebanon.
14165	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Arab foreign ministers met in Cairo, Egypt, Sunday with representatives of the two Lebanese camps and called on them to end their deadlock, which has set the religiously and politically divided country adrift.
14166	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The ministers urged both sides to back Gen. Michel Suleiman, a Christian, as president when parliament convenes Feb. 11.
14167	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of demonstrators, some wearing ski masks, gathered in the streets of the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya to protest power cuts.
14168	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	They said the disruption had left them with about six hours of electricity a day, compared with 21 hours for parts of central Beirut.
14169	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Shouting slogans and hurling epithets against Siniora's U.S.-backed government, they raced around the streets on motor scooters, set tires ablaze and tried to block roads, including the route to the airport.
14170	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"In south Beirut, people have interests and lives, too," said Suleiman, a 19-year-old demonstrator who declined to give his last name.
14171	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"We have jobs and work to do, and without electricity we can't do anything."
14172	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	An official of the Amal Party, a Shiite political group, was killed in an unexplained volley of gunfire.
14173	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The angry crowds swelled.
14174	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	They tossed tires and explosives into a bonfire, set cars on fire and showered security forces with rocks.
14175	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Gunfire again erupted.
14176	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	One victim in his late teens fell to the ground, choking as he lay in a pool of blood.
14177	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Ambulances waiting at the scene rushed to take him and other wounded people to a nearby hospital.
14178	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	It remained unclear whether the victims were struck by gunfire from troops.
14179	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	In a statement, the army said it was launching an investigation to determine the identity of the shooters.
14180	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Many of the demonstrators said they were loyal to Amal, one of the groups in the camp led by the Shiite militia Hezbollah and backed by Iran and Syria.
14181	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The official Lebanese news agency also reported violent demonstrations in the country's mostly Shiite south.
14182	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	But Amal disavowed the Beirut demonstrations and called on protesters to clear the streets.
14183	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The pro-government Future Party, led by pro-American politician Saad Hariri, blamed Damascus and Tehran for the incident.
14184	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"The forces of the Syrian and Iranian front are causing the situation to explode and provoking dangerous riots," said a statement issued by the party.

14189	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Cars, bank notes and TVs were going up in flames one chilly winter morning in the parking lot of Universal Chung Wah Funeral Home in Alhambra, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
14190	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Thirteen white-clad relatives of Dam Lam, 87, formed a circle, each cradling a stack of paper models: a foot-long 747 jetliner, a black-and-gold car sitting in the courtyard of a 2-foot-tall, red-tiled paper mansion.
14191	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	One by one, the items were thrown into the fire licking out of a 4-by-4-foot wheeled container, charred from years of use.
14192	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam would need the items in heaven, his family said.
14193	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Chinese mourners have been burning funeral paper -- known as joss paper, or dzi-dzat -- for centuries.
14194	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Traditionally, stacks of bamboo or rice paper bank notes were burned in braziers before the body of the deceased was lowered into the ground.
14195	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Practitioners of the ritual, derived from a mix of Taoism, Buddhism and regional folklore, believe that burning paper money equates to making advance deposits into an afterlife bank account that the deceased's spirit can access in heaven.
14196	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Sales usually jump around Chinese New Year.
14197	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Shops also offer deep discounts during Ghost Month, often referred to as the Chinese version of Halloween, which this year begins Aug. 1.
14198	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Many believe that spirits spend the month sniffing for souls to take, prompting the superstitious to crowd dzi-dzat stores looking for offerings to appease dead relatives.
14199	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Demand for increasingly extravagant dzi-dzat models is booming in Asia and in Southern California's large Chinese community, fueled by devoted family members who regularly burn care packages on festival days, birthdays -- even the day after they dream about the deceased.
14200	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Chinese immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between the 1950s and the 1970s are beginning to die, and their relatives are flocking to funeral homes to brush up on the ritual.
14201	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"For some people who cannot buy the actual items, they pursue the desire in the paper-goods form," said Xin Zhao, a professor of international marketing at the University of Hawaii.
14202	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"It's like vicariously having them."
14203	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lately, Southern California Chinese have become very particular about what they take to heaven, opting for fashionable upgrades of older dzi-dzat models, funeral workers said.
14204	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Which explains the paper cell phones, paper DVD players, paper jewelry and clothing.
14205	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	It also explains why mourners purchase paper laptops: so their dead kin can keep track of the paper credit cards that came with them.
14206	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	At Lam's funeral in December, several paper cars, including a gray sedan with a red-jacketed chauffeur behind the plastic windshield, were parked on the altar amid mounds of pears, apples and pomelo.
14207	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam was a simple man with a gentle soul, according to his son, Konn Lam, 37.
14208	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Born in Guangzhou, China, he got married in Vietnam, raised his four children in Hong Kong and moved to Alhambra in the 1980s.
14209	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	He made some money in the import-export business but also endured some financial difficulties.
14210	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Now, Lam's family wanted to give him all the luxuries that eluded him in life.
14211	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Before relatives stepped outside the funeral home to burn the paper offerings, Buddhist monks chanted sutras to allow Lam to travel peacefully to Buddha's world.
14212	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	White flowers framed a large photo of Lam on an altar, which about 25 mourners approached with incense sticks, bowing as the sutras continued playing over speakers.
14213	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Smoke from incense sticks curled under the gold and silver paper bridges that Lam's spirit was expected to cross, near a golden servant boy and a silver servant girl.
14214	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Strips of yellow paper listing Lam's name and the date of the ceremony hung from each offering, like a letter to be sent to an afterlife address.
14215	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Outside, during the burning, two attendants chanted Lam's name after each toss, also reciting the name of the object and a short verse symbolically delivering the goods into the afterlife.
14216	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Within minutes, the intricate models settled into ash.
14217	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The mourners bowed three times toward the bin, then went back inside to finish the funeral.
14218	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Paper funeral goods can be found in Los Angeles' Chinatown, as well as in Chinese enclaves in the area.
14219	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A wide variety of paper goods -- kitchen utensils, trendy paper pumps -- are strung up like pinatas over spreads of candles and religious figurines.
14220	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Red-wrapped boxes of paper dim-sum dumplings crowd shelves next to a paper rice cooker with a removable lid and treasure boxes brimming with paper playing cards.
14221	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In one corner of the Commonwealth Trading Co. in Chinatown, near a paper bathroom scale shrouded in plastic, the screen of a boxy gray paper TV with a "multi-system Penesonic" label shows a printed panorama of an Asian city.
14222	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Perched nearby, a papier-mache tabby with plastic whiskers and a lush coat of paper strips glares through beaded eyes at a paper microwave.
14223	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Owner Carol Kwan, 42, drifted among her clientele -- mostly middle-aged women chattering in Cantonese -- as she pointed out a hollow $25 "Afterlife Airlines" airplane emblazoned with a blue phoenix emblem.
14224	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The paper products usually cost between $5 and $30, she said.
14225	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In the back of a dark shelf in Kwan's shop, a bulky blue paper land-line phone with a removable receiver collects dust.
14226	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A more prominently displayed set features a sleek black cell phone with a "Moropalo" sticker that is similar to Motorola's logo.
14227	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The pack also includes paper batteries, a charger and a pager with lucky 6's and 8's splashed across the screen.
14228	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
14229	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Kwan started receiving custom requests: a paper wheelchair for someone who was disabled, paper fishing poles for an avid fly- fisher.
14230	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And, appropriately for car-crazed Los Angeles, Kwan is often asked for a specific paper Honda model with silver rims, or a BMW in a particular color.
14231	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the U.S., as is the pool of qualified artisans, she said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.
14232	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
14233	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Mourners in Asia certainly have no problem burning -- literally -- through money.
14234	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In affluent Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Macau, they want their dead to live a good afterlife, sending lavish models of paper villas with manicured gardens, cutouts of security guards and full-size replicas of BMW motorcycles up in flames.
14235	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And although China's economic renaissance has softened most regional authorities toward the ritual, burning paper replicas is still officially banned in most of the country.Communist ideology does not recognize filial piety and life after death.
14236	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The air pollution from burning paper also don't help, said Zhao, the professor.
14237	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Communist government has also commented on what it views as inappropriate items for burning.
14238	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Apparently the afterlife has a booming red-light district.
14239	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In April 2006, China's deputy secretary of the Ministry of Civil Affairs prohibited the burning of "adult" items such as paper condoms, karaoke hostesses and Viagra.
14240	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	U.S. funeral directors and merchants predict the ritual is headed for a downturn, however, as the community becomes more assimilated.
14241	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Younger, American-born Chinese avoid Kwan's shop, she said, because many do not understand the paper-burning tradition.
14242	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"Even though Chinese people are willing to pay more for funerals, I'm worried that fewer people will be buying the paper goods," she said.
14243	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"People born here just don't believe."

14245	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	New Mortgage Rule Aims to Close an Interest Rate Gap
14246	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
14247	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37, a legal secretary.
14248	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
14249	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
14250	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The economic stimulus package that President Bush signed last week includes provisions aimed at pulling those rates down and reinvigorating a part of the mortgage market still stunned by problems with subprime borrowers that surfaced last year.
14251	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
14252	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rattled investors stopped buying them.
14253	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
14254	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
14255	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 for single-family homes.
14256	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
14257	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The amount would vary so that the most expensive areas would qualify for bigger loans.
14258	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
14259	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
14260	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
14261	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the only ones investors are buying these days, which is why policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
14262	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
14263	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
14264	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The most we can say right now is that there will be some opportunity for some borrowers to achieve perhaps some interest- rate relief on their jumbo mortgages," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey-based mortgage research firm.
14265	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	A lot of the details have not yet been determined.
14266	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
14267	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
14268	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of calculating the limits
14269	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	it's expected to tell lenders next month what the limits are in various areas.
14270	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
14271	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
14272	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts.
14273	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of the region they will use.
14274	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the Stanford Group Company, a policy research firm in Washington, estimated that if the cap is based on median prices compiled by the National Association of Realtors, locally it would be about $500,000 and would apply to an area that extends into West Virginia.
14275	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"While not every American is going to get to enjoy a higher loan limit, what makes this program exciting is that those who need the assistance the most are going to get it," said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Stanford Group.
14276	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
14277	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lower rates would help Galloway, the Charles County homeowner.
14278	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
14279	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She has an adjustable-rate mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly to a higher level.
14280	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
14281	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
14282	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
14283	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
14284	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
14285	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
14286	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
14287	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	If investors feel that the larger loans inject too much risk into the pool of mortgages offered to them, they will demand a higher yield, which translates to higher rates for borrowers, said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital.
14288	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The perceived risk is not a creditworthiness issue, Rajadhyaksha said.
14289	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rather, it's the jumbo borrowers' well-documented fondness for refinancing when rates drop, which forces investors to reinvest the money at a lower rate.
14290	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
14291	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
14292	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75.
14293	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."
14294	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
14295	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But even if rates drop, not everyone will be able to take advantage of them, Retsinas said.
14296	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.
14297	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Virginia Left Behind: Opting Out of No Child Left Behind Would Be a Costly Mistake
14298	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:
14299	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Legislation is progressing in the Virginia General Assembly that would pull the state out of the No Child Left Behind law's oversight.
14300	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	No matter that the law has helped boost student learning and narrow the achievement gap, that schools are more accountable, and that students who go to failing schools now have options.
14301	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Not even the threatened loss of millions of dollars in federal education aid seems to worry lawmakers more intent on making political points than good public policy.
14302	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Both the House and Senate passed bills that would drop Virginia from the federal education program unless the U.S. Education Department waives some requirements.
14303	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The legislation directs the state Board of Education to come up with a plan for withdrawal, with one version even setting a deadline of June 30, 2009.
14304	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Del.
14305	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	R. Steven Landes, R-Augusta, a sponsor of the House bill, said that he hopes to clarify it so that the legislature would have to act again to sign off on any withdrawal.
14306	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The bills are in conference, where one hopes that they will die as the legislature rushes to adjourn.
14307	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, D, has said he won't support the measure, and the state board, while wanting more flexibility, doesn't favor a state withdrawal.
14308	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	They undoubtedly are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300 million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be tolerated.
14309	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the bills passed by overwhelming margins, a product of Republicans averse to f!
14310	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	ederal involvement and Democrats mindful of teachers unions' opposition to No Child Left Behind.
14311	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The result could produce the dubious distinction of Virginia becoming the first state to try to opt out of the landmark bill.
14312	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The initiative isn't all that surprising, given Virginia's past complaints about the law and the state's efforts to seek exemptions.
14313	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Most notable was its ill-advised rebellion over the testing of children with limited proficiency in English.
14314	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The state eventually backed down in the face of a loss of federal funds, but the reluctance to hold all students to the same standards says much about why No Child Left Behind is needed.
14315	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The federal law surely has flaws, but Virginia lawmakers are kidding themselves in claiming that state practices are sufficient.
14316	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Until No Child Left Behind came along, school districts were able to mask the low achievement of poor and minority students, there was no recourse for parents and children in failing schools, and no one was held accountable.
14317	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	In passing the measures, lawmakers talked about sending a message to Washington.
14318	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Too bad it's one that ignores the interests of children.
14319	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European Scientists Seek Cause of Spacecraft Glitch
14320	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the international space station.
14321	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Officials with the European Space Agency said all other systems on the state-of-the-art spacecraft were working well following its launch from the agency's base in South America, and they did not expect the engine problem to keep the transport, named the Jules Verne, from docking with the space station next month.
14322	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning.
14323	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The shuttle is carrying up part of a Japanese-made laboratory that will ultimately join labs produced by the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency that are already attached to the orbiting station.
14324	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Japanese astronaut Takao Doi is one of seven astronauts on the shuttle flight, which is transporting parts of the Kibo laboratory as well as a Canadian-built two-armed robotic system called Dextre.
14325	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The planned 16-day shuttle mission, the longest so far to the space station, is part of a concerted effort by NASA to finish assembly of the long-delayed space station by September 2010, at which point the three space shuttles will be retired.
14326	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year gap.
14327	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	NASA will have to rely on the Russian space agency to do most of the ferrying of astronauts and cargo to and from the station.
14328	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Europeans' Jules Verne, which is carrying 4.6 tons of cargo, is the first of six transport launches the Europeans promised as their contribution to the space station effort.
14329	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The vehicle has taken almost a decade to develop and launch.
14330	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	ESA spokesman Franco Bonacino said that the shutdown of one of the transport's engines was done automatically shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit and was associated with a pressure imbalance in the jumble of pipes and valves leading from the fuel tanks to the thrusters.
14331	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Bonacino said that researchers and engineers were working to fix the problem from mission control in Toulouse, France, and that the problem did not appear to pose any serious threat to the mission.
14332	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Even if it cannot be fixed, he said, the transport will still be able to dock with the space station.
14333	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	That docking cannot take place, however, until the shuttle Endeavour has arrived and departed -- more than two weeks from Tuesday.
14334	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	With that much time to work on the problem, European space agency officials said they expected to be able to fix it.
14335	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	About half of the Jules Verne's payload is propellant for use by rockets that periodically push the space station higher to compensate for the natural decay of its orbit.
14336	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The rest is oxygen, drinking water and dry goods.
14337	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	After spending four months docked to the station, the transport will carry away waste and will burn up in the atmosphere as the transport plunges to Earth over the southern Pacific Ocean.
14338	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Japanese space agency is also developing a space station transport, as are two private American companies working with NASA.
14339	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Jules Verne is the first automated spacecraft designed to dock with the station in full compliance with the tight safety constraints imposed after the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.
14340	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	China's Crackdown Wins Wide Approval From Public
14341	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In the West, the name Tibet has long evoked unspoiled Himalayan landscapes, cinnamon-robed monks spinning prayer wheels and a peace-loving Dalai Lama seeking freedom for his repressed Buddhist followers.
14342	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Here in China, people have embraced a different view
14343	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	they regard Tibet as a historical part of the nation and see its sympathizers in the West as easily fooled romantics.
14344	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Thanks to government propaganda, but also to ethnic pride, most Chinese see the Dalai Lama and his monks as obscurantist reactionaries trying to split the country and reverse the economic and social progress that China has brought to a backward and isolated land over the past 58 years.
14345	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The violent protests by Buddhist monks and other Tibetans that exploded in Lhasa on Friday, therefore, have generated widespread condemnation among the country's majority Han Chinese.
14346	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In street conversations, Internet discussions and academic forums, most Chinese have readily embraced the government's contention that the violence resulted from a plot mounted by the Dalai Lama from his exile headquarters in India.
14347	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Against that background, the Communist Party has met with broad popular approval in vowing to crack down on the rioters -- most of whose victims were Han Chinese -- and in qualifying the "impudent" Dalai Lama as a "master terror maker" who has hoodwinked the West with his appeals for peace.
14348	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	While the rest of the world invokes the Beijing Olympics and advises restraint, Chinese specialists and the public have urged the government to move decisively -- and gamble that the Olympics will not be spoiled.
14349	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The riot in Lhasa was caused by the Dalai Lama," said Zhang Yun, a professor at the government-sponsored Chinese Center for Tibetan Studies in Beijing.
14350	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks are very easily influenced by their religious leader, so they are irrational compared to other types of people," he added.
14351	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe any country in the world would allow anything that would destroy social order and ruin people's lives.
14352	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	There is a lot of prejudice against the Chinese government.
14353	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	People believe all that stuff about the Dalai Lama, and that the Chinese government is all wrong.
14354	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	But actually, the reality is not like that."
14355	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Jorge Chiang, a stylishly dressed Hong Kong businessman on a trip to Beijing, said he, too, believed the bloody rioting was set off on orders from the Dalai Lama.
14356	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Now, he predicted, the Chinese government will use the violence as a reason to round up the most prominent activist monks and "tighten its control over Tibet."
14357	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I believe the government is capable of resolving this situation," said a young woman walking in central Beijing on a brilliant spring afternoon.
14358	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"It's not the first time this has happened."
14359	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	An Internet commentator who identified himself as Roomx said Buddhist monks have no more right than anybody else to torch shops and kill the Han Chinese businessmen inside.
14360	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"They are all Chinese citizens," he added.
14361	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks who are connected to this conduct have to be arrested.
14362	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, it is not in conformity with rule by law."
14363	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Dramatizing how broadly such views are held even among the computer-savvy young generation, similar outrage exploded on the Internet after the Icelandic pop singer Bjork capped a concert in Shanghai on March 2 by shouting "Tibet!
14364	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Tibet!"
14365	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	after a song about independence.
14366	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Censorship officials huffed about how her gesture was out of place and pledged to tighten controls over foreign performers in China.
14367	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Tibet Autonomous Region's local government issued an announcement after the riots saying the Dalai Lama and his followers instigated the violence "intending to break Tibet away from the motherland."
14368	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Their allegation reflected China's long- standing complaint that the Dalai Lama, though he preaches limited autonomy, in fact has not abandoned his campaign to make Tibet and its 2.8 million residents fully independent from China.
14369	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	For those with long memories in Beijing, that has always been the situation.
14370	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama, now 72, led a violent uprising with help from the Central Intelligence Agency after Chinese troops reimposed rule from Beijing in 1950.
14371	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The subversion campaign failed, and he was forced in 1959 to flee on horseback to India, where he has lived in exile for half a century.
14372	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	It was to mark the anniversary of his dramatic flight over the Himalayas that anti-China demonstrations in Lhasa got started last Monday.
14373	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	(optional add end)
14374	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Tibet, a 750,000-square-mile territory sitting between the Himalayan and Kun Lun mountain ranges, was more or less part of various Chinese empires over the centuries, paying fealty but often too remote to be totally controlled.
14375	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	With the Dalai Lama as its leader, however, Tibet governed itself as an independent nation while China was torn by the upheavals of the first half of the 20th century.
14376	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	So for Beijing officials and the public they have educated through propaganda, the Dalai Lama is less a devout Buddhist than a secessionist rebel.
14377	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"Now the blaze and blood in Lhasa has unclad the nature of the Dalai Lama," said an editorial from the official New China News Agency.
14378	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"And it's time for the international community to recheck their stance toward the group under the camouflage of nonviolence, if they do not want to be willingly misled."
14379	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama's hold on people's imagination in the West has long irritated the Chinese government.
14380	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The New China News Agency editorial described his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in 1989, as "tainted" by Friday's rioting.
14381	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Congressional Gold Medal, which injected a chill into U.S.-China relations last October, turned out to be a "fig leaf" for the "rhetoric lama to sell his deceitful philosophy," it said.
14382	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In any case, the Chinese government has portrayed its presence in Tibet as beneficial for the population, citing the breakup of traditional serfdom in the countryside, improved health care and school construction.
14383	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	A Beijing-to-Lhasa train that began service in July 2006 was designed to further accelerate economic development, bringing in tourists and taking out minerals.
14384	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The economic development has been accompanied by an influx of Han Chinese who, Tibetan nationalists complain, have tightened their grip on all the economic and political levers.
14385	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Han Chinese who were killed in Friday's rioting, for instance, were identified as shop owners and employees singled out by Tibetans resentful of their economic domination.
14386	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Chinese arrivals, Tibetans and their supporters abroad say, have submerged Tibetan culture and Buddhist traditions by drawing the territory more closely into the rest of China.
14387	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Signs along the main street leading to Lhasa's celebrated Jokhang Temple, they note, are just as likely to be written in Chinese as Tibetan, and the saleswomen tend to speak Mandarin rather than the region's own tongue.
14388	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	A Chinese Tibet specialist in Beijing who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the tensions said the situation was inevitable as China pursues economic development of the region.
14389	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Like the American West in the 19th century, he said, modernization of China's West in the 21st century is bound to dilute the traditional Tibetan ways so esteemed abroad.
14390	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"China's government does not intend to destroy Tibetan culture," he said.
14391	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"But with the economy developing, the culture will change gradually, the same as in other places in the world."
14392	LTW_ENG_20080319.0096.LDC2009T13	The CW Wants Reality Horror

14394	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Cable Companies in Talks to Fund WiMax Network
14395	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in talks to invest in a wireless company based on WiMax technology, according to a source familiar with the talks.
14396	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The company would be operated by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire, which have focused over the past year on building a network based on WiMax, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.
14397	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	With the new company, the cable providers would be taking direct aim at the nation's biggest wireless carriers, Verizon Communications and AT&amp
14398	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	T, which have pushed aggressively into Internet and television services.
14399	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast would invest $1 billion and Time Warner would put as much as $500 million into the venture to create a next-generation, high-speed wireless network spanning the nation, according to the source.
14400	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Sprint declined to comment on speculation about the negotiations.
14401	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Such a venture is part of a race by wireless carriers and cable companies to become the main source for Internet, phone and television services, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Jupiter Research.
14402	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Verizon entered into competition with Comcast and Time Warner Cable through its FiOS fiber-optic network, which offers television services.
14403	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"Comcast and Time Warner are home-, broadband- and PC-oriented, so WiMax as a choice to get into wireless makes sense for them," Ask said.
14404	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"But whether or not they should be their own network or lease capacity from Sprint or Clearwire is something for Wall Street analysts to judge."
14405	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Intel and Google are also involved in the discussions about the new venture, according to the source.
14406	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The companies have signaled their interest in joining with Sprint and Clearwire to form a WiMax nationwide network.
14407	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Sprint and Clearwire have been trying to raise $3 billion to build a WiMax network.
14408	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Many analysts see WiMax as the biggest bet for the future for Sprint, which recently moved its headquarters from Reston, Va., to Overland Park, Kan., in a major restructuring.
14409	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Sprint lost 1 million wireless subscribers to other competitors in the past year.

14412	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax returns released by the campaign late Friday.
14413	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Former President Clinton has collected a whopping $51.9 million in appearance fees since leaving office in Jan. 2001 -- averaging about $150,000 per speech.
14414	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	He's also raked in $29.6 million from his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned tepid reviews.
14415	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
14416	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The documents released Friday illustrate a remarkable financial turnaround, thanks to speaking fees, lucrative book contracts and deals with a pair of businessmen who have paid more than $15 million to the former president.
14417	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who released his tax returns months ago, has often taunted Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for refusing to release hers earlier, suggesting she wasn't committed to transparency.
14418	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one- page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the past three years).
14419	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
14420	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her 2002 autobiography "Living History."
14421	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
14422	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons gave more than $10 million, or about 9.5 percent of their gross income, to charity, the records show, paying more than $33.8 million in taxes.
14423	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to various accounts.
14424	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	John Kerry is the richest senator with a net worth estimated at $211 million.
14425	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about $3.9 million from 2000 to 2007.
14426	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
14427	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
14428	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
14429	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.
14430	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.
14431	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Uncollected interest estimates required by the Internal Revenue Service indicate the loans were substantial, possibly in excess of $100,000, according to accountants.
14432	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The Clintons made interest-free loans to some of their family members," said Carson.
14433	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The loans ... are personal
14434	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons are going to respect their family members' privacy."
14435	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The returns shed greater light on Bill Clinton's close relationship with billionaire California businessman Ron Burkle, a family friend who has paid him about $15 million since 2002 as an adviser and rainmaker.
14436	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Less clear is the link between the former president and Indian- American businessman Vinod Gupta, the founder of database vendor InfoUSA, which has been accused of offering call lists to predatory telemarketers.
14437	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The tax returns show Gupta's company paid Clinton $800,000 in the last two years, far less than the $3.3 million in payments Clinton was said to have received in an investor lawsuit.
14438	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Carson did not return a request for a comment about Gupta.
14439	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Raw Drama Under One Roof
14440	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	"Alice's House," the debut feature of longtime documentary filmmaker Chico Teixeira, follows the ups and downs (mostly the downs) of a six-member Brazilian working-class family in Sao Paulo.
14441	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Alice (Carla Ribas), who works in a beauty parlor, is at the center of it all, living with her mother, who's slowly going blind
14442	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	a philandering husband
14443	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	and three sons.
14444	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	One son is a soldier by day and a male prostitute by night, another steals from grandma and the angelic youngest sits around in teen mopiness.
14445	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	When Alice decides to take up with an old flame, who's also married, the insanity level of the household reaches fever pitch.
14446	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Yes, we seem to be watching all the secrets, unmet aspirations, hatred, bitterness and frustration that we can cram under one roof.
14447	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	But "Alice's House" isn't pitched as family farce or even soap opera.
14448	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	It's more of a naturalistic tableau of humans trying to negotiate the twists and turns of life with their own desperations and inadequacies.
14449	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Even though it sounds awfully depressing, there's something moving about watching people go at their lives with everything they have -- or don't have.
14450	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	As Alice, Ribas has wowed international film festival juries, winning several awards.
14451	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	She'll wow you, too, with her character's aching vulnerabilities as all of Sao Paulo seems to sag heavily on her shoulders.

14457	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"They were so happy," Rospars Keffer said.
14458	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Rospars Keffer, 37, her husband, Michael Keffer, 44, and their children -- Megan, 9
14459	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Abbie, 7
14460	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	and Riley, 4 -- returned to their Long Island home Tuesday from a five-day, four-night trip, courtesy of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
14461	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The vacation was the family's first.
14462	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	They hadn't been able to afford to take along teachers who would help with the kids.
14463	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"You have to even the numbers.
14464	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	It has to be one on one," Rospars Keffer said.
14465	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	About a year ago, Michael Keffer's sister, Wendy Heaton, sent an e-mail asking DeGeneres to consider the Keffer family if she were to dedicate a show to a deserving family.
14466	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"I would love to see something really good happen for this family," wrote Heaton, 38, of Glen Allen, Va.
14467	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	In January, the comedienne surprised Heaton and Rospars Keffer with a phone call during a taping of the show, telling them she would provide a trip for both families.
14468	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It's amazing what you're doing, and Julie, it's wonderful that you stay so positive," DeGeneres said.
14469	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The show also paid for two teachers to go along: school psychologist Christie Schrank, who has worked with all three kids, and behavior analyst Kim Halter, who works with Abbie.
14470	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Meals were paid for by Disney, which also let the Keffer family spend one night at the Cinderella Castle Suite, replete with a butler.
14471	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"You couldn't buy this trip even if you wanted to," DeGeneres said.
14472	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It really was incredible," Rospars Keffer said.
14473	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	During the trip, the family went on rides, interacted with characters at meals, lounged at the hotel pool and spent time with the Heaton family and other relatives who also went along.
14474	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Megan, who can answer questions when she can choose among answers, said she liked Magic Kingdom more than EPCOT and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad more than Space Mountain.
14475	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	For Riley, who is conversational, the monorail was the best part of the trip.
14476	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Although Abbie, who does not have functional language skills, had difficulty getting through the dark and confined waiting line areas, Rospars Keffer said she loved the roller coasters.
14477	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"The faster and the scarier it was," she said, "Abbie liked it more."
14478	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	When a kid became irritable, either Halter or Schrank led them away so the family could enjoy the moment.
14479	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"The teachers were the element that changed the vacation from good to great," Michael Keffer said.
14480	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	His wife agreed, saying "We said it will be hard to go back after this."
14481	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Global Food Crisis: A Return to Wheat?
14482	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat is still a matter of debate.
14483	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives to keep former wheat acres in corn.
14484	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Within a year, David Braaten, a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others near completion.
14485	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.
14486	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and oats.
14487	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed, a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of Bismarck, the capital.
14488	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"There's getting to be more and more corn all the time," said Clark Holzwarth, the refinery's commodity manager.
14489	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	At current prices, farmers like Braaten can make more money from an acre of corn than from an acre of wheat, according to North Dakota State University economist Dwight Aakre.
14490	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	But wheat's biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned many farmers against it.
14491	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	They remember the 1990s, when fusarium head blight, commonly called "scab," devastated successive wheat crops.
14492	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.
14493	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements, requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year.
14494	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
14495	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Research might solve many of wheat's problems, but commercial companies say the opportunities for profit are limited.
14496	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
14497	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
14498	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is an expensive and time-consuming process.
14499	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed year after year.
14500	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
14501	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without significant loss of yield.
14502	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Syngenta, a large seed company, is still working to improve wheat, but Rob Bruns, who heads the North American cereal seed operation, acknowledged that it's difficult to create "enough critical mass to pay for the higher tech investments."
14503	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.
14504	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	At North Dakota State University, wheat breeder Mohamed Mergoum helped develop Glenn, a new wheat based on a cross with Chinese plants.
14505	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"It's a joy to make a difference in the life of the growers," said Mergoum, who worked earlier in the international program that developed higher-yielding "green revolution" wheats.
14506	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Glenn has proved resistant to scab, but it hasn't achieved universal acceptance among farmers.
14507	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Don Strickler, a farmer in Euclid, Minn., gave it a try one year but stopped using it after finding that a lot of the kernels cracked when they were separated from the chaff during threshing.
14508	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without other problems arising.
14509	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	James A. Anderson, a plant breeder at the University of Minnesota, predicted that the seed companies will continue to make inroads in wheat country with new kinds of corn and soybeans.
14510	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They've definitely moved into the spring-wheat region with dedicated breeding," he said.
14511	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to get whatever acreage they can and sell more of their seed."
14512	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	On Board and In Sync
14513	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	A nonprofit group has started briefing departments and agencies on the importance of properly "onboarding" new employees, after releasing a report showing that the government and new employees could benefit from well-run orientations.
14514	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
14515	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.
14516	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	Studies of private-sector employers, plus anecdotal evidence from agencies, show that good onboarding programs improve retention and get new workers up to full performance levels sooner, said Max Stier, president of the Partnership.
14517	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	"There's some set of folks that are leaving because it was not a good fit, but you can also infer that there are some who are leaving because they were not effectively engaged by their employer," he said.
14518	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The report, produced in conjunction with the Booz Allen Hamilton consulting firm, recommends that new employees be assigned a sponsor who can help integrate them into the organization, and that senior leadership, managers and supervisors become personally involved in the transition and not leave the task to the human resources office.

14521	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, it seems, we're getting hit from all directions.
14522	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Energy and food prices are soaring.
14523	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to collapse.
14524	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Government revenue is falling, and taxes are rising.
14525	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service.
14526	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Banks are pulling credit lines.
14527	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Auto companies are cutting production once again.
14528	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Even investment bankers are losing their jobs.
14529	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The tendency is to see these as separate developments, each with its own causes and dynamic.
14530	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
14531	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.
14532	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the bubble has burst, we are coming to accept the reality of lower prices, reduced production, declining homeownership rates and the wisdom that a house is not an ATM or a substitute for a retirement fund.
14533	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
14534	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real estate.
14535	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The same factors that were behind the housing bubble were also at work, to varying degrees, in the auto bubble, the commercial real estate bubble, the travel bubble, the college tuition bubble, the retail bubble, the Web 2.0 bubble and most recently the commodities bubble.
14536	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Unlike housing, which began losing steam two years ago, these other sectors have just begun the painful process of repricing and finding a new balance between supply and demand.
14537	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Take the case of the airline industry, which likes to blame its woes on skyrocketing fuel prices.
14538	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	While there's an ongoing debate about why the price of oil has doubled over the past year, there is little doubt that the declining dollar is a significant factor.
14539	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The decline is the result of years of large and growing U.S. trade deficits that should have caused the exchange rate to adjust years ago but didn't because so many of our trading partners in Asia and the Middle East were intent on linking their currencies to the dollar.
14540	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	In the process of maintaining those dollar pegs and reinvesting those surpluses in Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, they created a surfeit of cheap credit that spawned all those bubbles.
14541	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
14542	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
14543	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Producers have raised their dollar prices to prevent a decline in the global purchasing power from their commodities sales.
14544	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
14545	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At some point, that speculative bubble will burst and energy prices will plunge.
14546	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	When things finally settle down, the new equilibrium price is almost certain to be well above where it was last year at this time.
14547	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem.
14548	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
14549	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That includes such things as cleaning planes
14550	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	handling reservations, check-ins and baggage without undue waiting
14551	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	serving a decent meal when necessary
14552	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	and treating passengers fairly when flights are canceled.
14553	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But they also include costs that may be less obvious, like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs, paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
14554	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
14555	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
14556	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
14557	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
14558	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	What I've described is a double whammy for American households: the slower growth that comes with downsizing a number of key industries that expanded as a result of the credit bubble, along with rising prices for a food, energy, health care and almost everything imported.
14559	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And you can add a third blow, this one from government.
14560	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Across the country, state and local governments are already hip- deep into budget crises in response to declining revenue from property assessments and real estate transfers.
14561	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Here in Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as the eye can see.
14562	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble.
14563	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Despite the happy talk you might be hearing from the presidential candidates, it presents Americans with a stark and unpleasant choice.
14564	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	One option is to raise taxes and leave less money for private spending, which is what many state and local governments have begun to do.
14565	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
14566	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Either way, it amounts to a lower standard of living than we thought we had achieved.
14567	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Is all this the end of the world?
14568	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the richest country on the planet, certainly not.
14569	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But it does represent the end of a decade or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world -- and by their own leaders -- to live way beyond their means.
14570	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	As a result, the United States has gone from being the largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor.
14571	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the first time since the early 1980s, Americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the U.S. economy regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and sustainable growth.

14660	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed concert.
14661	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	In 1974, I went to the exquisite Waterbury Palace Theater.
14662	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Pulsating strobe lights reflected Reed's disposition.
14663	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Back then, it felt like a teenage thing, going to Reed, Bowie and Queen concerts.
14664	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Three decades later, it's all changed.
14665	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage thing in the '70s.
14666	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll concert.
14667	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Now, the music's almost over.
14668	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts might squeeze out another decade, but in the scope of things, that's nearing the end.
14669	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I've been there, from the smoke-filled general admission arenas where armband-wearing employees led the too-stoned to a backroom cot, to today's reserved seating shows where one flash of a digital camera gets you scolded by security.
14670	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From bowling alley music halls to stadiums of 40,000.
14671	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From Bic lighter encores to open cell-phone salutes.
14672	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
14673	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It's all been part of a living museum.
14674	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts are an invaluable art form.
14675	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They're exhibitions of the masters, music as their medium, the stage their easel.
14676	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	If I could collect them like paintings, I would.
14677	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The closest I come to collecting is buying tickets
14678	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands I saw 30 years ago.
14679	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and, recently, my four tickets for Lou Reed.
14680	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Though the music still rocks, perhaps even more than in the past, the musicians have become pensive with decades of life behind them.
14681	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed -- appearing at the Calvin Theatre in Northhampton, Mass. -- sang of the guardian angel who saved him rather than of the white heat that once ran through his veins.
14682	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	At the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach this summer, Stevie Nicks' first words were "Through good grace, you're here.
14683	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	When we get older, we learn to appreciate what we have more."
14684	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller closed his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other."
14685	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Most of them call for peace.
14686	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So, there is a sadness to the concerts this time around.
14687	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Time is no longer on their side.
14688	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Each tour now may be that band's last.
14689	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly done, approaching historical status.
14690	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My 18-year-old daughter discovered the recent Lou Reed concert in a local arts newspaper and insisted that we attend.
14691	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Last summer, we missed an outdoor concert by Don McLean, missed hearing "American Pie" live, beneath the stars.
14692	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	To this day, we're sorry.
14693	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	What if we never get another chance?
14694	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So my daughter's logic, rightly so, was that someday Mr. Reed won't be around to perform.
14695	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We both know that day will be sooner now, rather than later.
14696	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty years of his concerts no longer unfurl before us.
14697	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The clock is ticking, not only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
14698	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So we buy tickets to beat that clock.
14699	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Our summer lined up with bands that may never tour again.
14700	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
14701	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Stevie Nicks.
14702	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed.
14703	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller.
14704	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band.
14705	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love, reached our ears.
14706	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My children heard a Beatle sing.
14707	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will not.
14708	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will never see Mr. Reed, alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking transformation.
14709	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will not watch Mike Love consider if everybody had an ocean, surfboards set on the stage, Mr. Love giving the peace sign.
14710	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will never see Mick Jagger insist he likes it, this thing called rock 'n' roll, as he struts past Keith Richards on a seven-story stage.
14711	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Liza Minnelli will never invite their children to "Come, hear the music play."
14712	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
14713	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	This millennium's music has no Billy Joel defining the king and queen of the prom.
14714	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no young Steven Tyler whose train will still be rolling in 30 years.
14715	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no John Fogerty penning scathing lyrics against the war.
14716	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no Freddie Mercury rocking out stadium anthems.
14717	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
14718	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Beatle.
14719	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music.
14720	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert now is a gift.
14721	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert takes another little piece of my heart with the final encore.
14722	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The imminence is palpable, of the exhibit closing, of the stage lights going dark.
14723	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Hormone Treatment Could Aid HIV Treatment
14724	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The hormone produced good results but would have to be used very carefully to avoid inducing diabetes, said Dr. Steven Grinspoon of the Harvard Medical School, lead author of the paper.
14725	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	He presented the results, which will be published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City.
14726	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 40 percent of males and 16 percent of females who take cocktails of anti-AIDS drugs for their HIV infections develop fat deposits in the stomach, neck and cheeks.
14727	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Called visceral fat, it is associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.
14728	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Such patients typically have abnormally low levels of growth hormone and researchers had hoped that replacing it with genetically engineered human growth hormone -- the same drug used to treat below normal growth rates and can be abused by athletes -- might reverse the effects.
14729	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints.
14730	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the hormone.
14731	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half were given daily doses of about 0.33 milligrams of the hormone, well below the 2 to 4 milligrams used in previous studies.
14732	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half the subjects were given a placebo.
14733	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Over the 18 months of the study, stomach fat dropped by 8.5 percent in the patients receiving the hormone, compared to 1.6 percent in those receiving a placebo.
14734	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The team did not study cardiovascular risk.
14735	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial.
14736	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon said that future clinical trials should include a diabetes drug, such as metformin, to minimize side effects.
14737	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Another study in the special AIDS-themed issue of JAMA found that rifampicin, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can interfere with treatment for AIDS.
14738	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The finding was important because about one-third of the HIV-positive people in the world also have TB.
14739	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
14740	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Dr. Andrew Boulle and his colleagues at the University of Cape Town in South Africa studied nearly 4,000 people who began HIV treatment between 2001 and 2006.
14741	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About half received the most commonly used AIDS drug, nevirapine, And the rest received efavirenz, both of them so-called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
14742	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB, and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
14743	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	At the end of six months, 16.3 percent of those who received nevirapine when they were already taking rifampicin for TB had treatment failure marked by high levels of HIV in their blood, compared to 8.3 percent of those who did not have TB.
14744	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting.
14745	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.
14746	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The researchers do not know why the drug interferes with HIV treatment.
14747	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
14748	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	A third study looked at HIV treatment of injection drug abusers.
14749	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Some researchers have claimed that treatment provides little benefit in this group because they are not sufficiently motivated to take their AIDS drugs regularly.
14750	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Dr. Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia and his colleagues treated 3,116 patients at Canadian clinics, including 915 who were drug abusers.
14751	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant.
14752	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
14753	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.
14754	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Candidates Shed No Light on Dim Economic Future
14755	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the turmoil is the product of cozy relationships and corruption in Washington that can be cleaned up only by "reformers" like him and running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.
14756	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular administration.
14757	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
14758	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign quickly released a television advertisement after the disclosure that one financial giant, Lehman Brothers, had filed for bankruptcy and another, Merrill Lynch &amp
14759	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Co., Inc., had been bought out.
14760	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Our economy in crisis.
14761	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it," the ad said.
14762	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On the campaign trail in Florida, however, McCain sounded a slightly different note when he said the fundamentals of the economy remained "strong."
14763	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The Obama campaign immediately pounced on that as evidence that McCain is out of touch with ordinary people.
14764	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Speaking in Saint Clair Shores, Mich., Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., said: "I could walk from here to Lansing, and I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well -- unless I ran into John McCain."
14765	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning.
14766	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The past week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."
14767	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For months, Obama has been calling for increased regulation and accountability for financial institutions.
14768	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector.
14769	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections, loosened oversight and regulation, and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans have brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression," Obama's statement said.
14770	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain signaled some openness to increased regulation of financial institutions to increase transparency of their dealings -- though he was more cautious than Obama.
14771	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."
14772	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
14773	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
14774	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
14775	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
14776	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"That's shocking," said Bill Whalen, a GOP analyst at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
14777	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"If you are a Republican, you should be tagged on the economy.
14778	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	If there is such a thing as Republican Teflon, McCain enjoys it on this matter."
14779	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.
14780	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The AFL-CIO has sent out a mailing to about 800,000 union voters in battleground states that attacks McCain's proposal to divert some Social Security revenues into private stock and bond accounts.
14781	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine.
14782	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Would you?"
14783	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	A labor-backed group, Americans United to Protect Social Security, is also trying to capitalize on the market turmoil to question McCain's support for private Social Security accounts.
14784	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	In a statement Monday, the group called the Lehman collapse and the Merrill Lynch sale "perfect examples" of how a privatization would "turn Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed gamble."
14785	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Times staff writers Peter Wallsten in Washington, Noam N. Levey in Florida and Michael Finnegan in Colorado contributed to this report.
14786	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Supreme Court to Tackle Drug Maker Liability, Censorship
14787	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court also will decide whether officials can be held liable for violations of rights that took place on their watch.
14788	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	In a Los Angeles case, the justices will decide whether the former county district attorney can be sued by a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder based on the testimony of a jail-house informer with a record of lying.
14789	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	And in a New York case, the justices will decide whether former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft can be held liable for the arrest and alleged mistreatment of Muslim immigrants after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
14790	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On Monday, the justices will meet behind closed doors to sift through more than 2,000 appeal petitions that have piled up over the summer.
14791	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They are expected on Tuesday to announce they will hear a handful of those cases.
14792	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On Oct. 6, the court will begin hearing oral arguments.
14793	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	First up is a case that tests whether the makers of "light" and "low tar" cigarettes can be sued for allegedly seeking to fool smokers into thinking these cigarettes are safer.
14794	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court has much at stake in who is elected president in November.
14795	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On the major issues, such abortion, race, religion, the death penalty, gun rights, gay rights and presidential power, the justices have been sharply divided.
14796	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court regularly splits 5-4 on those issues, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy casting the deciding vote.
14797	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The retirement of a single justice could tip the balance to the right or the left.
14798	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	At age 88, Justice John Paul Stevens is seen as likely to step down during the next president's term.
14799	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	A second of the liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is 75, and could be replaced by the next president, particularly if the newly elected chief executive serves eight years in the White House.

14809	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine -- Skimming the Black Sea aboard a military motorboat, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo turned to an entourage of television cameras.
14810	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The dirty ones, those are the Ukrainian ships," he said with a light smirk.
14811	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The clean ones are Russian."
14812	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Against a backdrop of simmering tensions, Dygalo led journalists on an unusual wide-ranging visit to Russia's Black Sea Fleet this month, complete with unprecedented access to the flagship Moskva, a guided missile cruiser.
14813	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The public relations tour came just as the strategically crucial Russian base here finds itself at the epicenter of an escalating political clash.
14814	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Alarmed by Russia's recent war in Georgia, the Ukrainian government has imposed new restrictions on the Russian ships' movements, and suggested raising the rent on the fleet.
14815	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The Ukrainian president has called the surrounding Crimean Peninsula -- historically a part of Russia and still home to a majority Russian population -- the most dangerous spot in the country because of separatist sentiment.
14816	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russia has responded with icy vows to beef up its military forces in the Black Sea, eagerly showing off to reporters the firepower aboard vessels that were used to blockade Georgia -- and to remind the world of the deep Russian roots in this restive Ukrainian region.
14817	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The military budget will be revisited so that we can exploit these ships better and build new ships," said Dygalo aboard the Moskva.
14818	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The attitude toward the international situation has changed, of course.
14819	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	We understand quite well that Russia came under pressure."
14820	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Tensions have been climbing in this sleepy port since the fighting in Georgia brought into sharp focus two clashing interests: Russia's determination to take on a greater role in the former Soviet states, and the Ukrainian government's determination to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
14821	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The war in Georgia pitted a Western-friendly government against Moscow
14822	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Ukraine, meanwhile, is painfully divided in loyalties to the West and Russia.
14823	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Crimea is Russian-friendly turf.
14824	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to Ukraine back when the shared flag made the distinction between the two countries relatively unimportant.
14825	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Today, many residents of Crimea say they are Russian first, Ukrainian second.
14826	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They vehemently oppose Ukraine's bid to join NATO, bristle at anti-Moscow rhetoric from national leaders and say they are embittered by government efforts to infuse Crimea with Ukrainian language and culture.
14827	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Because of Crimea's staunch pro-Russia sentiments, analysts warn that the country could simply break apart if politicians in Ukraine continue their push toward NATO and the West.
14828	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"Most threats from Ukraine don't come from outside, but from inside," said Vladimir Kornilov, a political scientist in Kiev.
14829	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"Ukraine is living on its own volcano."
14830	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Critics accuse the Black Sea Fleet of deliberately exacerbating the tension.
14831	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"All the anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russia blocs are closely tied to the Black Sea Fleet," said Miroslav Mamchak, the snowy-haired chief of a group called the Ukrainian Community of Sevastopol.
14832	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"They struggle against the Ukrainian language.
14833	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They support the separatists."
14834	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Mamchak is a rare voice of Ukrainian nationalism here.
14835	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	He says that he has received death threats, and that Russian loyalists plastered the town with his picture under the slogan, "I'm a traitor to Russia."
14836	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Black Sea Fleet officials deny any political tampering.
14837	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	But many Ukrainians worry that the Russian government is stealthily working to stir up separatist sentiment.
14838	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	There have been reports that Russia has quietly begun to grant passports to some residents
14839	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russian officials say it's not true.
14840	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov, who has been banned from Ukraine for his rhetoric on Crimea, has said the region "doesn't belong" to Ukraine.
14841	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Moscow and Sevastopol have long had close ties, and the Moscow city government has built schools and apartment housing in the Ukrainian city.
14842	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	One opulent school is decorated with stained glass depictions of Moscow, and a university is affiliated with Moscow State University.
14843	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Pro-Moscow residents regard Mamchak's political organization as part of a Kiev-backed effort at "ethnocide."
14844	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Many locals gripe about the mandatory teaching of the Ukrainian language in schools and its use in the media and government paperwork.
14845	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Pro-Russia leaders also accuse the Ukrainian government of slowly moving people into the region from other parts of the country, and of installing pro-Kiev leaders in the city government.
14846	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"Faster, faster, faster to make everybody a Ukrainian," complained Raisa Telyatnikova, head of the Russian Community of Sevastopol.
14847	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"They want to completely distance us from our historical motherland, Russia, and turn it into an alien state.
14848	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	... They want to change the ethnic composition and break the spirit of Sevastopol."
14849	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	With its clusters of war memorials and Soviet awards from Vladimir I. Lenin still adorning the walls of the town hall, today's Sevastopol has the feel of a living monument to the USSR, or at least to the power of Moscow.
14850	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russian flags flutter throughout the city, a statue of Catherine the Great looms on the main street, and Russian is heard on most every corner.
14851	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Bookstores stock a paltry number of Ukrainian titles.
14852	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"It's only the language of state business," one bookseller said with a shrug.
14853	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Despite the fleet's warm ties with the locals, politicians in Ukraine have made it plain that the Russian navy could be asked to leave after its lease expires in 2017.
14854	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, has other ideas.
14855	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The fleet's presence here is woven into history, Russian military officials say.
14856	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The ships will stay put, and multiply, they have said repeatedly.
14857	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nothing prevents us from building up our forces here in Ukrainian territory," said Rear Adm. Andrei Baranov, the fleet's deputy chief of staff.
14858	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The fleet will be renovated.
14859	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	... New ships will be arriving here."
14860	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On the ground of St. Nicholas the Sanctifier Church, the bones of an estimated 60,000 Russian fighters, casualties of the Crimean War in the 19th century and World War II, lie in a vast, quiet cemetery that rolls downhill toward the sea.
14861	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On the steps of the sanctuary, priests spoke of their emotional ties to generations of sailors, and of their unwillingness to hoist a Ukrainian flag.
14862	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	In a scene that seemed cut from czarist times, Russian navy officials and Orthodox priests sat at a long table, knocking back shots of vodka and proclaiming emotional toasts.
14863	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The West shuddered 150 years ago when Russia showed its sword, and the Black Sea turned red with blood," said Igor Bebin, a pink-robed priest who rose to his feet, vodka glass held high.
14864	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"That was the supreme truth.
14865	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	And the truth is that now, for the first time, the sword of Russia is shining again.
14866	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Be afraid of the sword."
14867	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The Russians cheered, and took a deep drink.
14868	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain Moves to Soften the Tone at Rallies, if Not in Ads
14869	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At the end of perhaps the most charged and negative week of the presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain sought to tone down his rhetoric toward Sen. Barack Obama even as his running mate, allies and his own advertising continued to attack the character of the Democratic nominee.
14870	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences with Obama.
14871	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the United States.
14872	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We want to fight and I want to fight, but we will be respectful," McCain said, again prompting loud boos when he declared that he admires Obama's accomplishments.
14873	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"I want everyone to be respectful, and let's be sure we are.
14874	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... That doesn't mean you have to reduce your ferocity.
14875	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It's just got to be respectful."
14876	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At one point in the event, McCain grabbed back the microphone from an elderly woman who had begun to say that she didn't like Obama because he is an Arab.
14877	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"No, ma'am.
14878	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	No, ma'am," McCain said.
14879	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have serious differences with on fundamental questions."
14880	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was mentioned.
14881	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
14882	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I wouldn't be running."
14883	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's allies and advertising unleashed a flurry of attacks on his rival's ethics, touting Obama's ties to a Vietnam War-era radical and accusing him of being connected to a group accused of engaging in voter fraud.
14884	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	He launched a tough new television ad linking Obama to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which bombed U.S. facilities in protest of the Vietnam War.
14885	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
14886	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of that relationship."
14887	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At the town hall, McCain promised not to relent on tying Obama to Ayers, telling the crowd, "We'll be talking about that more."
14888	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning will backfire.
14889	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"They can run misleading ads.
14890	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They can pursue the politics of anything goes.
14891	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It will not work.
14892	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Not this time," Obama said.
14893	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
14894	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses, a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and complement what has already been done for major financial institutions.
14895	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain said the federal government should suspend rules that require seniors to begin withdrawing from their retirement accounts when they reach age 70 1/2 to allow them more times to try and recoup recent losses.
14896	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on Obama's character.
14897	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The accusation about voter fraud came in a conference call with his campaign manager, Rick Davis, who said he is worried the election is being "stolen" in several battleground states where irregularities have been alleged in voter registrations collected by ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.
14898	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We don't think the election is something that should be stolen from the American electorate," Davis said, urging Obama to join him in calling for federal investigations and media inquiries into ACORN and its ties to Obama.
14899	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"ACORN is an organization that has violated the law on a repeated basis," Davis said.
14900	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
14901	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad, in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks, intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business."
14902	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It says ACORN stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to ACORN run long and deep.
14903	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... They even endorsed him for president."
14904	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a lawyer.
14905	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They said his work as an organizer in 1992 was not connected to the group.
14906	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"The McCain campaign's allegations about Senator Obama are completely transparent and false," spokesman Tommy Vietor said.
14907	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented challenges facing their families and our nation."
14908	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
14909	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Agents with the Nevada secretary of state and attorney general's office raided the group's Clark County headquarters, alleging that ACORN had hired felons to collect signatures and had submitted about 300 apparently fraudulent registration cards.
14910	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter registration forms that they collect.
14911	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But, in many states the law requires them to submit forms to election officials even if they contain suspect information.
14912	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We feel the current strategy from the right is to create and manufacture a so-called crisis of voter fraud," said Brian Kettenring, chief organizer for ACORN in Florida.

14922	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She has never seen a bill.
14923	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
14924	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs.
14925	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
14926	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
14927	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
14928	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
14929	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Welfare, prenatal care or in- state college tuition might be available in one place and inaccessible across a state line.
14930	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
14931	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	With limited federal guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions, frequently shaped by political winds.
14932	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
14933	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The number of patients is not large.
14934	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In California, illegal immigrants account for about 1,350 of the 61,000 people on dialysis.
14935	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
14936	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
14937	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The investment in a single patient can easily top $1 million over time.
14938	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states draw the line at illegal immigrants.
14939	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
14940	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	That is because patients without regular dialysis frequently end up in emergency rooms.
14941	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
14942	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It's like "rescuing a person from drowning, giving someone a good meal and then pushing them over the side," said Dr. Laurence Lewin, a kidney specialist in Orange County, Calif.
14943	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health, it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue.
14944	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In Texas, where illegal immigrants generally can't get routine care, some have cycled through the emergency room at El Paso's Thomason Hospital more than 100 times for life-saving dialysis, said kidney specialist Dr. Azikiwe Nwosu.
14945	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Such patients are at increased risk of heart attacks and infections.
14946	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"It's heartbreaking," said Dr. Claudia Zacharek, a kidney specialist who until recently worked in Galveston, Texas.
14947	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Your hands are tied."

14949	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In grappling with what services to provide for illegal immigrants, some states tip toward the need to care for the sick.
14950	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their presence.
14951	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Congress tried to establish a balance.
14952	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In 1986, it barred illegal immigrants from the federal health benefits generally available to the poor, with one notable exception: emergencies.
14953	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The federal government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.
14954	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

14956	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Debates have flared over chemotherapy, life-support and dialysis.
14957	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In 2002, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, cosponsored a bill to provide dialysis and other chronic care needed to prevent expensive ER visits.
14958	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It failed.
14959	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	What's left is an ambiguous policy that the federal government itself has struggled to clarify.
14960	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.
14961	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	If California and other states were using federal funds to help provide routine dialysis, she said, they were mischaracterizing it as an emergency treatment.
14962	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	More recently, she acknowledged that the federal government has been sharing the cost in California for years.
14963	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It has long been left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis, she said.
14964	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states, including Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, take the position that kidney failure does not automatically qualify as an emergency because patients can survive for weeks without dialysis before toxins accumulate to fatal levels.
14965	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Other states have wavered.
14966	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	North Carolina, for example, now provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants.
14967	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Conversely, the Georgia Medicaid program stopped paying for dialysis in 2006 amid rising sentiments in the Legislature that illegal immigrants were a financial drain.
14968	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Georgia ain't California or New York," said Mark Trail, head of Georgia's Medicaid program until last month, noting a strong conservative tradition.
14969	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
14970	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
14971	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
14972	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In a settlement last year, the state agreed to restore its policy of providing routine dialysis, but the settlement applies only to Arizona.
14973	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	California's dialysis policy is largely an economic calculation, said Stan Rosenstein, the administrator of Medi-Cal, the state health-care program for the poor that covers dialysis for illegal immigrants.
14974	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of one routine treatment is about $250.
14975	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
14976	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	To advocates of stricter immigration controls, such comparisons miss the point.
14977	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Taxpayers are on the hook for people who aren't supposed to be here," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
14978	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will lure more sick people from other countries.
14979	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We can not provide dialysis to the world," said Ramiro Valdez, a Dallas social worker and medical consultant.
14980	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
14981	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Now, a free transportation service picks her up three days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
14982	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"If I go home, I won't be able to afford this," said Aquino, 56.
14983	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"No way am I going home."
14984	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California, but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand the gravity of their plight.

14986	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid program does not.
14987	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dr. Karla Vital, a kidney specialist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, said her hospital encourages Mexican nationals to return to Mexico.
14988	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals pay for plane tickets back.
14989	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Mexico offers dialysis to those who can afford it, but access is far more limited for the poor.
14990	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
14991	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
14992	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
14993	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"I have friends who have died because of lack of dialysis," said Lopez, a longtime diabetic who arrived in the U.S. four years ago while her kidneys were still functioning.
14994	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal immigrants.
14995	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
14996	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three dialysis-free years.
14997	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Critics, however, say that dipping into the organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are waiting.
14998	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"It's not like you go to Costco and pick up a kidney," Krikorian said.
14999	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
15000	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She said she is grateful for the care she has received in California.
15001	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.
15002	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents in Mexico, she has never returned.
15003	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be able to get back.

15013	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	States News Service
15014	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	WASHINGTON, Feb.16 - The seed-supply company that once prided itself on keeping the White House lawn green is in the red.
15015	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	When AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it put farmers at an even graver risk.
15016	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The bankruptcy has already caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture revenue nationwide.
15017	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Founded in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the seed industry through mergers and acquisitions.
15018	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By 1999, the company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
15019	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	For the past five years, ABT has been the nation's main provider of alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such as corn, soybean, wheat and other vegetables.
15020	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The company has also supplied the turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic facilities, and its product was even used by White House landscapers.
15021	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Agriculture officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's bankruptcy is having a domino effect across the country.
15022	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Crop farmers, who are already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic losses.
15023	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last two weeks.
15024	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider for the seed industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the smaller companies - something they had trouble doing.
15025	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Last February, ABT tried to solve their problem by hiring a new senior management group ``with expertise in operation and integration,'' and set goals to build company capitol, manage the acquired operations and achieve profit in 2000, according to a company profile.
15026	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
15027	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``The bottom line is there was basically no warning,'' said Don Schriftinson, policy director for the Wyoming Department of Agriculture.
15028	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
15029	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who were selling their product to the Nevada-based company.
15030	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	One grower said that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT could still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment for the next two years.
15031	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Of the 13 states with contracted companies, Oregon and Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking nearly $40 million in contract compensation alone.
15032	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Congressmen in Wyoming and Idaho have already asked for federal assistance.
15033	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation wrote, ``be prepared to intervene with the appropriate emergency assistance for it will become apparent that the effects of this bankruptcy will force large numbers of seed farmers out of business.''
15034	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Though Wyoming farmers only lost $4.5 in contract money, the state will eventually require nearly $20 million to help stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT fiasco, according to state officials.
15035	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Finding it too costly to wait for federal decisions to be made, the Wyoming State legislature intends to pass it's own emergency relief bill by the end of the week.
15036	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Bankruptcy proceedings could give ABT an estimated $80 million in asset liquidation sales.
15037	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	But officials say that money will be used to pay off credit debts and other loans.
15038	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``I am a seed grower and the focus should not be 'poor seed grower,''' said Wyoming farmer Terry Jones.
15039	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``States need to deal with their local economy now so they won't have a huge, disastrous impact not just on their rural communities but on the nation as a whole.''

15043	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	After a career in international diplomacy spanning 40 years, the last three as the chief weapons inspector for the United Nations in Iraq, Hans Blix retired on Monday with the expiration of his U.N. contract.
15044	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	Blix, a Swedish expert on international law, spent most of the day giving interviews.
15045	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	In his periodic reports to the Security Council after inspection teams returned to Iraq in November, Blix stressed that though Iraqi cooperation had fallen short of council demands, his team had found no conclusive evidence of active chemical or biological weapons programs.
15046	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	After U.S.-led efforts to pass a resolution approving a military assault unraveled, some of its supporters seemed to consider the dispassionate Blix partly to blame.
15047	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	The U.S. administration in Iraq has not invited Blix or his inspectors to return, and unless the matter is formally resolved in the Security Council, which is unlikely, the United Nations will not name a permanent replacement for him.
15048	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	Associates say Blix, 75, will return to his home in Sweden, where he will write a book about his career, which included 16 years as director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
15049	NYT_ENG_20030630.0076.LDC2007T07	He will also indulge in his hobbies of hiking and cooking, especially making his own marmalade.

15052	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli- Palestinian peace negotiations.
15053	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli military raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
15054	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el-Sheik.
15055	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Olmert that Egypt "rejects and is indignant at the military operation."
15056	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but by serious endeavors toward peace," Mubarak added at his news conference with Olmert.
15057	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to arrest "terrorists who had killed Israelis."
15058	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual force in normally quiet Ramallah.
15059	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He said Israeli troops returned fire, but did not initiate it.
15060	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"Things developed in a way that could not have been predicted in advance," he said.
15061	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"If innocent people were hurt, this was not our intention."
15062	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it "proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake."
15063	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce with Israel to the West Bank.
15064	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace," Abbas said.
15065	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert and Mubarak said Egyptian efforts were continuing to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by Hamas militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian prisoners.
15066	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	There had been speculation that the two men might be able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is blocking more substantive discussions with Abbas.
15067	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Egyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert- Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present.

15070	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	It was an unusual and emotional day for Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.
15071	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Earlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95 and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved for Israel's leaders.
15072	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert defeated Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993.
15073	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but "Teddy Kollek made it so."
15074	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Thursday also marked a year since former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken.
15075	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert, Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Sharon's tragedy at his news conference in Egypt.
15076	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	In general, Olmert has been regarded as inferior to both Sharon and Kollek.
15077	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	In the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot, nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of Olmert's performance as prime minister.
15078	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Israelis are unhappy with the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him with the more stolid and experienced Sharon.
15079	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Still, Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early on Thursday parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a crucial test of his government's ability to survive.
15080	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption scandal.
15081	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He has not been touched by this scandal, though he has been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of influence.
15082	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	But his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has been placed under house arrest and ordered not to contact Olmert as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Zaken's brother and two other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key jobs in return for tax breaks.
15083	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	About 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading scandal.

15085	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out hours before Olmert met with Mubarak.
15086	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Palestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.
15087	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The army would not confirm that Hamad was the target, but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but escaped.
15088	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a spokesman said.
15089	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	It was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it prompted an angry response.
15090	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Youths on rooftops threw stones, metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the Israeli army vehicles.
15091	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	There were mortars fired at the Israeli soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.
15092	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Palestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23
15093	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Khalil al-Badawi, 20

15095	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	and Ala al-Himran, in his 20s -- died from gunshot wounds at a Ramallah hospital.
15096	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	In Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed in fighting between Fatah and Hamas.
15097	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The fighting centered around the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.
15098	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	In Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades.
15099	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Two of his bodyguards were also killed.
15100	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	About 25 others were wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to the gunmen to restore calm.
15101	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, five Palestinians, including a woman passer-by, were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gunbattles, which broke a weeklong lull.
15102	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Other militant factions arranged a truce overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released by the other sides, but the truce broke down Thursday.
15103	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, returned to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
15104	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	His entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish, Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.
15105	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Early Friday, Haniya said he and Abbas had agreed at emergency talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.
15106	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	For the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Razuri, 50, who is said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.
15107	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Palestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.
15108	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	A leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said the security chaos could be resolved only with political agreement.
15109	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"The weakness of the Palestinian political system and the situation of the current Hamas-led government have contributed to this state of lawlessness," he said.

15114	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And prepare for the day when San Francisco has a gritty new suburb: Los Angeles.
15115	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Indeed, much of Southern California, including the Baja Peninsula, will eventually migrate up the west coast to make Alaska even more gargantuan.
15116	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists have long prided themselves on their ability to peer into the distant past and discern the slow movements of land and sea that have continuously revised the planet's face over eons.
15117	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Now, drawing on new insights, theories, measurements and technologies -- and perhaps a bit of scientific bravado -- they are forecasting the shape of terra firma in the distant future.
15118	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The maps and animations by these scientists are helping explain core principles of geology to increasingly wide audiences.
15119	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Schools, textbooks, museums, Web sites and television shows now routinely feature images of what the forecasters say the planet will look like eons from now.
15120	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And geologists are using the forecasts to deepen their own investigations of plate tectonics.
15121	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's tremendous," said Warren J. Nokleberg, a senior research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. "It lets students and scientists better appreciate the mobile Earth, to see where it's going.
15122	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	That's very powerful."
15123	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Practitioners acknowledge that their predictions, however intriguing, become more theoretical when pushed far into the future, as with advanced weather forecasts.
15124	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their most ambitious efforts peer 250 million years ahead.
15125	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But their more short-term predictions, they note, draw on mountains of geophysical data and involve relatively small extrapolations of current trends, like the steady northward march of Southern California.
15126	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Despite uncertainties, the field of geopredictions is booming.
15127	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	One Web site has received almost 30 million hits since its debut in 1998, and the field's admirers now include top scientists.
15128	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's quite good pedagogically," said Frank Press, a geologist and past president of the National Academy of Sciences.
15129	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It captures the attention."
15130	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Press features one of the forecasts in his introductory college text, "Understanding Earth" (Freeman, 2006).
15131	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He and three co- authors present a snapshot of how the planet's surface might look 50 million years from now, calling it "a plausible scenario."
15132	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the snapshot shows that Africa has drifted to the north, plowing into Europe and fusing the two landmasses, eliminating the Mediterranean Sea and replacing it with the Mediterranean Mountains.
15133	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The rugged range runs down the middle of a continent far bigger than current-day Eurasia, a giant new agglomeration that might be called Afrasia.
15134	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	While peering 50 million years into the future may seem like a stretch, geologists consider such spans of time the blink of an eye.
15135	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	If one year represented Earth's past, 50 million years would equal less than four days, or about the limit of accurate weather forecasts.
15136	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"Fifty million is fairly straightforward," said Christopher R. Scotese, a geologist at the University of Texas, Arlington, who has pioneered the predictions in recent years.

15138	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's like you're driving on the highway and you want to know where you're going to be in 10 minutes.
15139	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	You check the speedometer, do a calculation, and project your present motion.
15140	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But beyond 50 million years," Scotese added, "like on the highway, unexpected things can happen."
15141	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Forecasts of future continental motion developed slowly as offshoots of the theory of plate tectonics, which won acceptance in the 1960s and 1970s, shattering old dogmas of continental immobility.
15142	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory of plate tectonics holds that the surface of Earth is composed of a dozen or so huge crustal slabs that float on a sea of partially molten rock.
15143	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over ages, hot convection currents in this sea, as well as gravitational forces, move the plates and their superimposed continents and ocean basins, tearing them apart and rearranging them like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.
15144	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory, named for the Greek word "tekton," or builder, is a study in slowness.
15145	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Colliding plates grind past one another about as fast as fingernails grow.
15146	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, geologists measure such changes with great precision thanks to the advent of global positioning satellites and small base stations that dot remote areas of the planet and operate unattended.
15147	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Arrays of such instruments track the overall movement of plates.
15148	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	From the start of the theory's acceptance, geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past and to render it in credible reconstructions.
15149	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A famous result was Pangea -- "all the land" in Greek -- a supercontinent that some 200 million years ago held the outlines of today's continents in embryonic form.
15150	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1970, Robert S. Dietz, who uncovered major clues to plate movement in the deep sea, wrote a Scientific American article on the breakup of Pangea.
15151	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
15152	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Dietz zeroed in on the San Andreas fault, the deep gash beneath California that spawned the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- one among many -- and today also threatens the Los Angeles area.
15153	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The fault marks the seam where the Pacific plate slides relentlessly northward past the North American plate.
15154	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
15155	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And in another 50 million years, he added, Los Angeles will have moved up the west coast into Alaskan waters.
15156	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Such visualizations caught the eye of Scotese in the late 1970s when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
15157	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He loved the challenge of the big picture, and of using his computer programs, new to such work, to speed the endless drawing and redrawing.
15158	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	With his graduate adviser, he made detailed maps showing the past evolution of the continents.

15161	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
15162	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"I said, 'Hold on, how could I possibly project that far?"'
15163	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	he recalled.
15164	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But being a rash graduate student in need of extra change, I decided to give it a try."
15165	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
15166	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Scotese drew a series of futuristic maps and, in the 1990s, found an ideal way to communicate his increasingly detailed visions of the terrestrial past and future: over the Internet.
15167	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, Scotese's Web site, www.scotese.com, which he started in 1998, showcases his work, called the Paleomap Project.
15168	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Teachers use his animations, and his site has won scientific awards.
15169	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	(He aids the publishing world, too, providing Press and his co-authors with their map of the future world.)
15170	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, some of his most ambitious efforts center on envisioning how Earth might look 250 million years from now.
15171	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The easy part, Scotese said, is the continents.
15172	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their masses might change shape but seldom disappear altogether because their bedrock weighs little compared with dense ocean crust.
15173	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Continents literally float above the action.
15174	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	So do mountains.
15175	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Once formed, they tend to persist, disappearing only after ages of erosion wear them down.
15176	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The difficult part, he said, is predicting the development of new subduction zones in the seabed, and in comprehending how aggressively they rearrange the land.
15177	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to understand all the forces down there," he said.
15178	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"There's probably some input from the mantle," the deep, hot, churning zone below the crust.
15179	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It probably has some say on which way the plates go."
15180	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	His long-term forecast, despite the uncertainties, portrays a distant time when the world's continents come together again to form a new supercontinent, which he calls Pangea Ultima.
15181	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	An animated depiction of Pangea Ultima demonstrates a bold exercise in futuristic thinking.
15182	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	First, the Mediterranean closes.
15183	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Then -- 25 million to 75 million years from now -- Australia moves north, slamming into Indonesia and Malaysia before pirouetting counterclockwise to smash into the Philippines and then Asia, eventually merging with it.
15184	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Antarctica also moves north, shedding its icecap.
15185	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Roughly 100 million years from now, it plows into the Indian Ocean, and 50 million years later wedges itself between Madagascar and Indonesia.
15186	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The Indian Ocean becomes a virtual inland sea.
15187	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Scotese said, the biggest tectonic change of all -- driven by a giant subduction zone -- has torn through the dark Atlantic and begun to eat up seabed, slowly closing the ocean.
15188	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some 200 million years from now, the closure forces Newfoundland to smash into Africa and, a bit later, Brazil to ram into South Africa.
15189	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The collisions gain force
15190	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	250 million years from now, the continents will have merged into a new supercontinent that encircles what remains of the Indian Ocean.
15191	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's more like a big donut or bagel than Pangea," Scotese noted.
15192	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In looking for a name, "I tried Bagelea or Donutea but figured that would trivialize the whole experience.
15193	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A friend suggested Pangea Ultima -- classy, like a fancy car.
15194	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It implies that it's the last Pangea, which certainly isn't true, but it's the last one I'm going to come up with."
15195	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over billions of years, the continents have split and joined repeatedly in a slow dance.
15196	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
15197	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	As Scotese envisioned, they can break apart and reverse course to merge again.
15198	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.

15200	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
15201	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
15202	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Instead of the Atlantic disappearing, they say, the Pacific might slowly vanish, sending North and South America careering into Asia.
15203	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Sergei A. Pisarevsky, a geologist at the Tectonics Special Research Center of the University of Western Australia, calls the resulting supercontinent "Amasia."
15204	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But he said his vision bore no special likelihood of coming true.
15205	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"My guess," he said, "is that the Pacific should disappear."
15206	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	J. Brendan Murphy, a specialist on tectonic cycles at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, echoed that view.
15207	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists, he said, know too little about the causes of plate motion to predict the dance of continents into the far future.
15208	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But in the next few decades, he added, progress in geology is likely to lay bare Earth's inner workings and enhance the art of plate forecasting.
15209	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Even with today's efforts, Murphy said, "all the coughing stops in class when I show a projection.
15210	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It's a very interesting way to look at the world."
15211	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing to realize," he said, "is that modern geology is just a snapshot of a continuous-action movie.
15212	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	When you zoom out and look over a long enough time, you realize everything is mobile."
15213	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	AFTER A WRONG TURN, MANNING FOCUSES ON FOOTBALL AND FAMILY
15214	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	LAKE FOREST, Ill.
15215	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In football and in life, Chicago Bears cornerback Ricky Manning has made mistakes.
15216	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Messy, public ones.
15217	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he cannot complain about the way things have turned out.
15218	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, in the Bears' divisional playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Manning was flagged for an illegal block that negated a 66-yard punt return by Devin Hester for a go-ahead touchdown.
15219	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Two field goals by Robbie Gould, the second one in the fifth minute of overtime, propelled the Bears to a 27-24 victory and catapulted Manning into his third National Football Conference championship game in four seasons.
15220	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	That reversal of fortune mirrored what has happened in Manning's life over the past 10 months.
15221	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
15222	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
15223	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After the news of his latest arrest became public, the Carolina Panthers declined to match the Bears' five-year, $21 million offer for Manning, who was a restricted free agent.
15224	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	The 25-year-old Manning already was on probation from a previous assault in Los Angeles, and if his case had gone to trial he faced the possibility of a prison sentence.
15225	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't willing to take that risk," he said.
15226	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.
15227	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was suspended for one game by the NFL for violation of its code of personal conduct, causing him to miss the Bears' 17-13 loss at New England on Nov. 26.
15228	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	When he plays, he makes a difference.
15229	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's been a big part of what we're doing," Bears coach Lovie Smith said Monday of Manning, who had five interceptions during the regular season and added a sixth Sunday in the fourth quarter off Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.
15230	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Asked to describe his interception, Manning said, "I guess it's just being in the right place at the right time."
15231	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.
15232	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Later, while putting a square diamond-studded earring in his left ear, Manning marveled at how much has changed since last year when he stood in the victorious visitors locker room after the Panthers' 29-21 divisional playoff victory against the Bears.
15233	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been a whirlwind," he said.
15234	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Confronting his legal issues was just part of it.
15235	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After taking stock of his life, Manning broke up with his fianc?e, married a woman from his hometown, Fresno, Calif., whom he had been friends with for years, and became a father.
15236	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His son, Ricky III, was born on Nov. 14.
15237	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"The last nine months has been a drastic change for me," Manning said.
15238	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been crazy."
15239	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.
15240	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I'm smiling.
15241	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I've got a kid.
15242	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm married to a beautiful lady.
15243	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Because of the trouble I got in, that's why my life has changed, but I like the change."
15244	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning used part of the signing bonus he received from the Bears to buy a Bentley, but it does not get much of a workout.
15245	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His circumstances have caused him to become a homebody.
15246	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't go out anymore," he said.
15247	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't do anything."
15248	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A gun enthusiast, Manning said he no longer frequents the firing range.
15249	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He has given his guns to friends and relatives until his probation is over.
15250	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He sends his regrets when he is invited to parties.
15251	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I miss some of the guys' parties that they're throwing," Manning said, "but they understand.
15252	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	They know I just can't take that chance of something happening."
15253	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
15254	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
15255	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	For starters, he did not need to be out with a friend at 3 a.m.
15256	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Me being out at 3 o'clock at night and partying and being around people that can take advantage of me is just not a good situation," he said.
15257	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Initially I reacted to getting disrespected when I thought I shouldn't have been," he added.
15258	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"OK, I shouldn't have done that.
15259	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But I thought I had done the right thing by walking away, by leaving."
15260	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he was arrested nonetheless and his public image took a brutal hit.
15261	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It was tough, knowing that what happened gives people a misconception of me," Manning said.
15262	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He added, "It took for that to happen for me to learn."
15263	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Since April, Manning has joined the Bears' family and created a family of his own.
15264	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He keeps his relatives closer, having come to the conclusion that they are the best company because they will not lead him astray.
15265	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He flew in some cousins for the game Sunday, some of whom had never traveled by airplane before.
15266	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.
15267	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In his arms, he was cradling his sleeping son.
15268	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning walked past a makeshift TV studio where Gould was being interviewed about his game-winning field goal.
15269	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A dozen fans, many of them holding camera phones as if they were lighters at a concert, had gathered to pay homage to Gould and were blocking the exit.
15270	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A security guard cleared a path for Manning, who slipped through as cleanly as a knife through a perfectly baked cake.
15271	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Not a single fan stuck to him.
15272	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.
15273	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT
15274	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	PARIS
15275	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
15276	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
15277	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
15278	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But they say the plan would also impose international supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority.
15279	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
15280	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to the plan.
15281	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna.
15282	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.
15283	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mission governing the territory would be replaced by another international organization that would have executive powers to any annul legislation that breaches Kosovo's obligations under U.N. agreements, diplomats said.
15284	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
15285	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
15286	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Ahtisaari handed his recommendations to representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia during a meeting in Vienna, Austria.
15287	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	It will be presented to the Serbian and Kosovo governments on Feb. 2.
15288	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
15289	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.
15290	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Russia, which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo as a province, wants the Security Council vote delayed until Serbia has formed a government, diplomats in Vienna say.

15405	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	ANALYSIS: MANY EPISCOPALIANS WARY, SOME DEFIANT AFTER ULTIMATUM BY ANGLICANS
15406	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There was a time when the Episcopal Church in the United States was known as "the Republican Party at prayer," but in the last 30 years it has evolved into the Rainbow Coalition of Christianity.
15407	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are hip-hop Masses, Native American rituals to install a new presiding bishop and legions of gay and straight priests who don the rainbow stoles of gay liberation.
15408	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Its pews are full of Roman Catholics and Christians from other traditions attracted by its aura of radical acceptance.
15409	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Now the conservatives who numerically dominate the global Anglican Communion have handed their Episcopal branch in the United States an ultimatum that requires the church to reel in the rainbow if it wants to remain a part of the Communion.
15410	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	With a communique issued in Tanzania on Monday after a five-day meeting, the leaders of Anglican provinces around the world (known as primates) asked the U.S. branch to bar gays from becoming bishops, and to stop official blessings of same-sex unions.
15411	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.
15412	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There is no certainty at all that Episcopal leaders will now comply.
15413	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance.
15414	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Many took umbrage at what they see as meddling by foreign primates who are imposing their culture and theological interpretations on the American church.
15415	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"Being part of the Anglican Communion is very important to me," said Bishop Mark S. Sisk of New York.
15416	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"But if the price of that is I have to turn my back on the gay and lesbian people who are part of this church and part of me, I won't do that."
15417	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	On her way home from the meeting in Tanzania, Katharine Jefferts Schori, the new presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, wrote three pages of "Reflections on the Primates Meeting" that were released late on Tuesday.
15418	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Many in her church had been eager to hear her explain why she signed onto the communique, when she, as much as anyone, is clearly a product of the church's inclusive rainbow culture.
15419	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In her former diocese in Nevada, she allowed the blessing of same- sex unions and consented to the election of V. Gene Robinson, an openly gay man, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003.
15420	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	She is the first woman to be presiding bishop, and the first woman primate in the Anglican Communion.
15421	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In her "reflections," Jefferts Schori struck a tone of respect for those on both sides: "Both parties hold positions that can be defended by appeal to our Anglican sources of authority -- scripture, tradition, and reason -- but each finds it very difficult to understand and embrace the other."
15422	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	She suggested that the struggle for equality for gay men and lesbians would eventually prevail, just as the slaves in Africa were eventually freed -- an occasion she and the other primates commemorated last Sunday at a ceremony at the Cathedral in Zanzibar, the site of a former slave-trading market.
15423	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori concluded by noting that Lent is about to begin, and said that both sides in this conflict are being asked to undergo a "season of fasting
15424	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	" the liberals from blessing same- sex unions and consecrating gay bishops, and the conservative primates from "transgressing diocesan boundaries," which is what happened when some primates from Africa, Asia and Latin America recently tried taking control of conservative parishes in the United States that elected to leave the Episcopal Church.
15425	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Conservatives in the church were also wary about the communique's plan, but generally far more upbeat than the liberals.
15426	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique recommends that the Episcopal Church establish new positions of authority, a council and a "primatial vicar," who will have oversight of the conservatives within the Episcopal Church, so they do not have to turn to primates from other countries.
15427	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Bishop D. Bruce MacPherson of Western Louisiana, who addressed the primates in Tanzania on behalf of the conservatives, said of the communique's recommendations, "I believe it to be the beginning of a process, a mechanism that will enable us to work toward healing and reconciliation."
15428	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
15429	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	But already there were questions from Episcopalians who said that such significant decisions as a moratorium on gay bishops and blessings, and the creation of a council and "primatial vicar" could not be taken by the House of Bishops alone, but by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church, which includes lay and clergy delegates.
15430	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The General Convention, however, does not meet this year and is not scheduled for another meeting until 2009.
15431	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique calls for the House of Bishops to "make an unequivocal common covenant that the bishops will not authorize any Rite of Blessing for same-sex unions."
15432	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Some liberals on Tuesday were latching onto what they saw as a loophole because the wording specifies that the bishops will not authorize rites.
15433	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are many bishops who have not formally authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless allow priests to perform them.
15434	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	If this is all the communique is requiring, they suggested, the Episcopal Church can live with that.
15435	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"Blessings happen, sure," said Sisk.
15436	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"But I didn't authorize them."
15437	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	MacPherson, however, said that his understanding is that the communique asks the bishops to actually stop the performing of same-sex blessings in their dioceses.
15438	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The most despairing reactions came from gay men and lesbians in the church, who say this is not reconciliation, but capitulation.
15439	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to make people choose between the Communion and the church's commitment to gay and lesbian people," said the Rev. Michael Hopkins, a priest in Rochester, N.Y., and the former president of Integrity, a long-established organization of gay and lesbian Episcopalians.
15440	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Although the Episcopal Church is known as an inclusive haven, Hopkins said, he already knows gay men and lesbians who are leaving.
15441	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said, "People like me can only convince other people to hang in there for so long."

15444	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	America's growing love affair with energy-efficient cars is starting to take a toll on the nation's crumbling highways and roads.
15445	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Requiring fewer fill-ups at the pumps, the vehicles are putting a pinch on the federal Highway Trust Fund -- the major government funding source for highway and mass-transit projects.
15446	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
15447	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	To be fair, federal officials say, it's not just energy-efficient autos that are sucking the fund dry.
15448	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
15449	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for each gallon of gas.
15450	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
15451	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"This total dependence on gas tax isn't working anymore."
15452	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters also chairs the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that is reviewing the situation and will make recommendations to Congress in a report this year.
15453	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the commission began a two-day hearing with California transit officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's downtown Los Angeles office to discuss the region's needs.
15454	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
15455	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
15456	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
15457	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
15458	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.
15459	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in Atlanta.
15460	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Las Vegas is next, and the commission will conclude its hearings after visiting Minneapolis and Chicago in April.
15461	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	After the commission files its report, legislators could decide to adopt its recommendations or use them as a guide for funding federal projects, said Chris Bonanti, special assistant to the administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration and staff liaison to the commission.
15462	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Brian Turmail, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said commissioners are asking why all the increased spending on road projects isn't paying off.
15463	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Roads are still congested.
15464	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Traffic is getting worse.
15465	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"What we're spending isn't really getting the results we want," he said.
15466	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
15467	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
15468	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund surfaced in 2005.
15469	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
15470	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Later that year, President George W. Bush signed a $286.4 billion transportation law that also established a 12-member commission -- a mix of federal, state and business leaders -- to look for sustainable funding options.
15471	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said hybrids account for just a fraction of the car market and could not be playing a significant role in the decline of the Highway Trust Fund.
15472	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
15473	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Taylor acknowledged that over the years, automotive technology has made all cars and trucks more fuel-efficient and contributed to fewer trips to the pump.
15474	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
15475	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., said the national highway system has been underfunded for years and that the problems are returning to haunt the government.
15476	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
15477	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
15478	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	At the same time, the price of construction has increased far quicker than inflation, partly driven by a development boom in China that has driven up the price of raw materials such as cement and steel, said Dan Beal, managing director of public policy for the Automobile Club of Southern California.
15479	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
15480	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
15481	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
15482	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	There already is a pilot project on that option in Oregon, but it's not clear how that might affect how much the average driver would pay.
15483	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.
15484	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.
15485	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nobody wants to pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what they're currently paying."
15486	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	SOME HOPE REPORT FINDING HPV IN MORE THAN 25% OF WOMEN DIFFUSES TENSION OVER CONTROVERSIAL CANCER VACCINE
15487	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
15488	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer, health researchers say.
15489	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The study, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides the most comprehensive assessment of human papillomavirus prevalence among American women.
15490	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The overall prevalence was slightly higher than previous estimates.
15491	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"We expected to find that this was a highly prevalent infection," said Dr. Eileen Dunne, a staff epidemiologist with CDC and chief author of the new study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
15492	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The new report, based upon a national analysis of nearly 2,000 women, was released amid a heated debate in Texas over whether 11 -year-old girls should be required to receive a vaccine that protects women from the virus.
15493	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
15494	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	That still means about 3 million U.S. women could benefit from a vaccine, said Dr. Maurie Markman, vice president for clinical research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
15495	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
15496	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
15497	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Gov. Rick Perry issued an executive order that made Texas the first state to mandate the vaccine for younger girls.
15498	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry said his goal was to protect future generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000 women a year in this country.
15499	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry has been rebuked by social conservatives, who say his promotion of the vaccine condones pre-marital sex, as well as legislators who say he exceeded his constitutional powers by issuing the executive order.
15500	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The Texas Medical Association, too, has said the vaccine shouldn't be mandated, citing, in part, the high cost of the three-shot regimen, which starts at $360.
15501	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
15502	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
15503	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"... It's a shame that we can't focus on educating people about the benefits of this vaccine instead of just getting embroiled in the political intrigue," said Dr. Lawrence Stanberry, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
15504	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.
15505	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The earlier studies indicated that widespread use of the vaccine would save money because initial investments in the cost of the vaccine would be more than recouped by a reduction in cancer treatment expenses and eventually might increase the recommended interval between Pap smears, Stanberry said.

15508	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD -- A suicide bomber detonated a car full of explosives in the historic booksellers' district of Baghdad Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring 65 others, police officials said.
15509	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The bombing followed the opening of a new stage in the intensified security plan for the capital, where more than 1,100 American and Iraqi soldiers moved on Sunday into Sadr City, a stronghold of Iraq's largest Shiite militia.
15510	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack in the book market raised questions about the effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in the capital but not the number of car bombings.
15511	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep black smoke billowing above the city.
15512	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Glass littered the roadway in the booksellers' district, known for its historic buildings including former government offices, and as the place where intellectuals once gathered in the city.
15513	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The bomb exploded next to a printing shop, sending sheets of paper blowing into the air and littering the street with smoldering bundles of envelopes.
15514	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Firefighters at the scene tried to get the flames under control, but the blaze flared up repeatedluy because of all the paper.
15515	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack, one of a number in the weeks since the new security push began, took place the day after Iraqi special forces and British troops stormed the offices of an Iraqi government intelligence agency in the southern city of Basra.
15516	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	British officials said the raid uncovered about 30 prisoners, some showing signs of torture.
15517	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	News of the raid on Sunday, with its resonant themes of torture and sectarian-driven conflict, appeared to catch Iraq's central government by surprise, and raised new questions about the rule of law in the Shiite-dominated south, where less than two weeks ago Britain announced plans for a significant reduction in its forces because of improved stability.
15518	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The Iraqi government gave no further statements or information about the raid Monday.
15519	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	It was condemned on Sunday by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a conservative Shiite, who said nothing publicly about the evidence of torture.
15520	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	"The prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the incident of breaking into the security compound in Basra and stressed the need to punish those who have carried out this illegal and irresponsible act," said the full text of a statement issued late Sunday by his office.

15522	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
15523	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of Congress heard wrenching testimony on Monday from wounded soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and contrite promises from top Army officials to correct the conditions there.
15524	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Two generals who had commanded Walter Reed, a premier military hospital in Washington, accepted responsibility for the situation faced by some wounded troops, including poor housing, neglect and a hopelessly complicated bureaucratic maze.
15525	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said they were working to address the problems at Walter Reed and were examining the situation at other medical centers.
15526	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We have let some soldiers down," said Pete Geren, the undersecretary of the Army, addressing the panel before the hearing began.
15527	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were to testify.
15528	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop for the hearing, the first of several that congressional committees intend to hold.
15529	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The subcommittee members heard first on Monday from two soldiers badly hurt in the war in Iraq, and from the spouse of another soldier injured in Iraq, about their experiences at Walter Reed.
15530	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Together, the trio's stories set the emotional tenor for the testimony from military officials that followed.
15531	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi, causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
15532	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient treatment, he recounted.
15533	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Despite being extremely disoriented, he said, he was given a map and told to find his own way to his new residence on the hospital's sprawling grounds.
15534	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He wandered into a building and received directions.
15535	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
15536	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He told of languishing in the hospital's bureaucratic system that evaluates soldiers for continuing in active duty or becoming medically retired, and what benefits they should receive.
15537	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start over several times.
15538	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Spc. Jeremy Duncan, one ear shredded by a makeshift bomb, told of the moldy living conditions in Building 18.
15539	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't fit for anybody to live in a room like that," Duncan said.
15540	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Annette L. McLeod, whose husband, Wendell, returned from Iraq with a head injury, spoke emotionally of her distress during his treatment.
15541	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"My life was ripped apart the day my husband was injured, and having to live through the mess we've had to live through at Walter Reed has been worse than anything I've had to sacrifice in my life," Annette McLeod said through tears.
15542	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was "extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The Washington Post.
15543	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His brother, Maj. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, a senior medical officer, has now been named to command Walter Reed.
15544	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said extensive repairs were being made to deal with the deplorable conditions at one of the facilities on the hospital campus, Building 18, in which soldiers getting outpatient treatment at the hospital were found to be living in crumbling rooms soiled by mice, cockroaches and mold.
15545	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Most of the soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.
15546	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Allegations about shoddy treatment received by wounded soldiers at the prominent hospital, which is the centerpiece of the military's medical system, have touched a public nerve and deeply embarrassed the military in the past few weeks.
15547	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has been thrown on the defensive, and members of Congress have been quick to express outrage.
15548	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"This is absolutely the wrong way to treat our troops, and serious reforms need to happen immediately," said Rep. John F. Tierney, D-Mass., who is the chairman of the House oversight and government reform subcommittee on national security and foreign affairs.
15549	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq."
15550	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He warned of a coming crunch with President Bush's new plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.

15553	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we send more and more troops into Iraq and Afghanistan, these problems are only going to get worse, not better," he said.
15554	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Last week, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey was ousted over his handling of the revelations at Walter Reed, and officials changed the hospital's commanding officer twice in as many days.
15555	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated the White House's pledge to fix the problems at Walter Reed.
15556	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.
15557	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we work to improve conditions at Walter Reed, we want to find out whether similar problems have occurred at other military" and Veterans Administration hospitals, he said.
15558	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"These brave men and women deserve the heartfelt thanks of our country, and they deserve the very best medical care that our government can possibly provide."
15559	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news articles have hinted at similar problems for years.
15560	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
15561	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"You're not going to be able to Scotch tape over it," he said.
15562	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
15563	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We really need to reinvent this process," Kiley said.
15564	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
15565	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He was pressed on Monday to explain how he had not known about the conditions at Building 18, even though he lived across the street from it.
15566	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He explained that inspections of barracks were not part of his normal job duties.
15567	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But the subcommittee members continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to civilians had left the hospital depleted.
15568	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.
15569	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Beyond specific steps to streamline the bureaucratic process that is faced by wounded troops and to improve living conditions, military officials said it may be time to re-evaluate whether Walter Reed should be closed in several years, as had been previously planned as part of a national base reorganization process.
15570	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Several patients at Walter Reed attended the hearing Monday and echoed some of the problems described.
15571	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But Staff Sgt. Brian Beem, who lost his right leg to a makeshift bomb in Baghdad in October, said he had no idea conditions were so bad for some of his counterparts, even though he had heard grumbling.
15572	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"At my level," Beem said, "I'm ignorant of it."

15595	NYT_ENG_20070306.0155.LDC2009T13	A group of investors from Columbus, Ohio, pays $100 million in early 2004 for zero-coupon bonds from a Venezuelan state bank that went bankrupt in the 1980s.
15596	NYT_ENG_20070306.0155.LDC2009T13	A few months earlier, in October 2003, Venezuela's attorney general had determined the bonds were valid.

15612	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Andy Bean gave his driver to a kid who was sitting in the stands at the 18th hole after the first round of the AT&amp

15615	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	And everyone was smiling.
15616	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"You've either got to take it or I'm going to break it," Bean told the boy.
15617	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"He was happy, and I was happy to get rid of it."
15618	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean was happy with the results of the driver he used Saturday.
15619	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He used a driver he'd tried earlier in the year on the Florida swing.
15620	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	It was one of 40-some drivers he's tested this season.
15621	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hit 12 of 14 fairways -- four more than the previous day -- and shot a 6-under 66 to put himself in contention at Valencia Country Club.
15622	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Hale Irwin, who had a two-shot lead after Friday's first round, struggled to a 1-under 71 but leads by one shot.
15623	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, who has won 45 tournaments on the Champions Tour, has won 33 of 47 tournaments in which he was leading or sharing the lead heading into the final round.
15624	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	When asked about his success while playing with the lead, Irwin stuck his fingers in his ears and said, "La, la, la, la, la, la!"
15625	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, Bean and Bobby Wadkins will play in today's final round pairings.
15626	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean and Wadkins, who shot a 67, are tied for second.
15627	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Five others -- including Loren Roberts, Jim Thorpe and Gil Morgan -- are tied for fourth two shots back and 14players are within three shots of the lead.
15628	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But seeing Irwin's name at the top of the leaderboard can't be too comforting for the rest of the field.
15629	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"Trying to make up shots on Hale isn't the easiest thing in the world," Bean said.
15630	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"I know I have to shoot at least this well (66) to have a chance."
15631	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin had a three-shot lead after three holes when he made a 12-foot putt on the par-3 third hole.
15632	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He was his typically consistent self -- hitting fairways and greens -- on the front nine.
15633	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But Irwin struggled on the back nine.
15634	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He started with an errant drive to the left on No. 17 and had to scramble, eventually sinking a 5-foot putt for bogey .
15635	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Yet for all of Irwin's troubles -- he was going to go over them in his hotel, not at the range -- he still leads the tournament.
15636	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that it's over, and I'm in the lead," Irwin said.
15637	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that I went from a two-shot lead to a one- shot lead."
15638	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hopes they can both put their best golf on display.
15639	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"When you beat him, you usually beat a guy that doesn't make mistakes," Bean said.
15640	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"To me, that's fun.
15641	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Your games are both there.
15642	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	You'd much rather win and make birdie than for someone else to make bogey."
15643	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	FRENCH COURT BACKS NEWSPAPER THAT PRINTED CARTOONS OF MUHAMMAD
15644	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	PARIS
15645	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	A French court ruled Thursday in favor of a satirical weekly newspaper that faced charges brought by two Muslim groups after it published cartoons featuring the Prophet Muhammad that had caused an international uproar when a Danish newspaper published most of them.
15646	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The charges, brought by the Paris Mosque and the Union of Islamic Organizations of France, accused the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, and its editor, Philippe Val, of "publicly abusing a group of people because of their religion."
15647	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The charges could have resulted in a six-month prison term for Val and a fine of about $29,000 against the newspaper.
15648	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	In its Feb. 8, 2006, issue, Charlie Hebdo republished 12 drawings that appeared in September 2005 in the Danish newspaper Jyllands- Posten, some of them lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.
15649	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The publication in Denmark set off deadly rioting across parts of the Muslim world and resulted in Muslim boycotts of Danish products.
15650	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Charlie Hebdo published the cartoons in solidarity with the Danish newspaper and to make a point about freedom of expression in France, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe.
15651	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	On the cover of its Feb. 8, 2006, issue, Charlie Hebdo published an original drawing by the French cartoonist Cabu depicting a crying Muhammad with his head in his hands, saying, "It's hard to be loved by idiots."
15652	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The publication in France set off a public debate on the country's devotion to its secular ideals.
15653	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	While France has limits on public expression, particularly with regard to racist speech, enforcement varies according to the national mood and penalties for infractions are usually low.
15654	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The court acknowledged that one of the cartoons, which depicted Muhammad wearing a turban shaped like a bomb, might offend some Muslims.
15655	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	But it said that, given the context of its publication, it saw no "deliberate intention of directly and gratuitously offending the Muslim community."
15656	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Last September, a Danish court rejected a similar lawsuit against Jyllands-Posten.
15657	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Val called the ruling a victory for freedom of speech and secular French Muslims.
15658	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The Union of Islamic Organizations of France said it would appeal the decision.
15659	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The Paris Mosque said through its lawyer that it probably would not.
15660	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	THIS RESEARCH IS A JOKE
15661	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don and Alleen Nilsen take humor seriously.
15662	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
15663	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They can tell you why a particular joke succeeds and why another falls flat.
15664	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take the show The Simpsons.
15665	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
15666	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Their research may seem light- hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to studying science and technology.
15667	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
15668	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Using humor can give you power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships.
15669	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	A spontaneous joke relieves tension or saves face when your presentation flops.
15670	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It also can have the opposite effect.
15671	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Tell the wrong joke and you alienate people and become a jerk.
15672	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	(More on that later, including how to keep out of trouble.)
15673	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Forty years ago, Don Nilsen began using written jokes in his English classes to make grammar lessons more interesting.
15674	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	His students paid more attention to a funny paragraph than to a bunch of sentences.
15675	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
15676	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are both literature professors, and the study fit with their love of language.
15677	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor
15678	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
15679	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.
15680	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Instead of toiling in a lab, the Nilsens watch television sitcoms and rent DVD comedies.
15681	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are voracious readers of anything funny.
15682	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can jot down anything funny that he reads or hears.
15683	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Once a year, the couple attends an academic humor conference where about 300 academics from around the world give humor presentations.
15684	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting.
15685	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
15686	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't stop him from trying.
15687	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and setting up the joke.
15688	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	I get it set up really well, and then I think, 'What was it about?'
15689	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	My students love to see me get caught this way."
15690	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Even though he is joke-challenged, he and his wife believe the average person can learn to be funny.
15691	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's more challenging with some people," said Alleen Nilsen, citing former Vice President Al Gore as an example.
15692	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of humor.
15693	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
15694	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use," Alleen Nilsen said.
15695	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor is much broader.
15696	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	What is funny
15697	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In their research, the Nilsens have put together 11 basic types of humor.
15698	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They range from "superiority," which includes jokes that put down Congress, to "hostility," which can be perceived as hate speech, depending on the audience.
15699	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Ambiguity," in which something can be understood in two or more ways, is widely used.
15700	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck: Our business is picking up."
15701	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes have common threads.
15702	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
15703	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
15704	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Penicillin."
15705	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean an ultimate dream.
15706	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Humor pitfalls
15707	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Just as humor has common threads, humor gone awry can mean trouble.
15708	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
15709	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
15710	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.
15711	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
15712	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
15713	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
15714	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Alleen Nilsen used to keep notes about humor that cropped up in university meetings.
15715	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
15716	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The most successful administrators were the ones who made spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments.
15717	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	People who were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
15718	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."
15719	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One person makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the meeting.
15720	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Someone else adds a funny thought.
15721	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
15722	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"The people who laugh together bond," Alleen Nilsen said.
15723	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Making fun of one's self also is fairly safe.
15724	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."
15725	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make people aware of how important humor is in communication.
15726	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In the end, humor can help you cope with life's problems.
15727	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's like changing a diaper," Alleen Nilsen said.
15728	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's not a long-term solution, but it helps for a while."
15729	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GOING WITH THE FLOW
15730	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Back in the 1970s, when Lou Casagrande was starting out as a curator at the Science Museum of Minnesota, visiting a museum aimed at kids sometimes felt like being in a "pinball machine."
15731	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"My instructions were to create energy and hands-on in every nook and cranny," said Casagrande, who eventually became senior vice president at the Minnesota museum before taking over as director of the Boston Children's Museum in 1994.
15732	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We went probably too far.
15733	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was too much energy.
15734	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
15735	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	That was then.
15736	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Now, as Casagrande readies the Children's Museum for its April 14 reopening, he's talking up the new exhibitions, from the tennis ball launcher to a light-box dance floor.
15737	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow.
15738	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art - but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum used to feel.
15739	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"For us," Casagrande says, "this is the biggest revolution."
15740	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
15741	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some spots - the fourth floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible to find.
15742	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
15743	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
15744	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
15745	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new building won't alleviate all these problems.
15746	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But several key design features should help.
15747	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
15748	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors, some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
15749	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	While many a city has gotten into the children's museum business lately, Boston's edition has a long history.
15750	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1913 and housed in Jamaica Plain, the museum opened its current home in Fort Point Channel in 1979, renovating a 19th-century wool warehouse.
15751	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
15752	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	After two decades in its spot, the museum undertook a renovation plan, closing on Dec. 31 to complete its current expansion.
15753	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled, rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front of the taller, existing brick warehouse building.
15754	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The defining feature of the newer space is its open feel.
15755	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
15756	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A series of 10- to 12-foot-wide hallways, reached by a stairway or elevator and stretching the entire length of the expansion, connect the new section with the old.
15757	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	This is how visitors get around.
15758	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for visitors to pause and relax.
15759	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
15760	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Visitor flow has driven the new project to the point that the expanded Children's Museum isn't actually all that much bigger than the old space.
15761	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
15762	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	How can an expanded museum be barely expanded?
15763	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the institution's needs.
15764	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"You can't just use kind of the multiple of going from x square feet to y," said Thomas E. Moloney, chairman of the board.
15765	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing is the museum becomes much more functional."
15766	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Consider how the space is used.
15767	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The fourth floor is now off limits to visitors, used mainly for offices.
15768	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A bigger and technologically updated KidStage has moved from the tucked away corner to the ground floor.
15769	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	With three floors, not four, open to the public, activity is pushed down, and spread throughout.
15770	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
15771	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Wide doorways have been cut into the brick that used to be the outside of the museum.
15772	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Each gallery is accessible through the bridges.
15773	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the ease with which its visitors walk through the building.
15774	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Smaller, newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
15775	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"A museum at the stage Boston's at, where it's been around for so many years, it has the square footage to focus more on visitor flow," says Janet Rice Elman, executive director of the Association of Children's Museums.
15776	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
15777	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum.
15778	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The KidPower section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move an exhibit sign up and down.
15779	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There's a dedicated space for traveling exhibitions.
15780	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story climb.
15781	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon Pain.
15782	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But what excites Gail Ringel, the museum's vice president of exhibits, is the 3,000-square-foot second floor space known as The Common.
15783	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs, and a giant chess game.
15784	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But in less than an hour, the staff can break down, and move out, all the activities.
15785	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	What's left is a large, central space for groups to gather.
15786	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We get literally thousands of people here for Chinese New Year and St. Patrick's Day," says Ringel.
15787	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We hosted significant performances from area artists, dancers, and musicians in there, and it was a serious impediment to flow in the museum.
15788	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The Common is going to be a very important space.
15789	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It'll give families a space to sort of rest and recharge.
15790	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then when we're having our large festival days, the exhibits can be swept out."
15791	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Boston isn't the only children's museum concerned about the way people get around the building.
15792	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In Philadelphia, the Touch Me Museum is constructing an $88 million building set to open next year.
15793	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But ask Nancy Kolb, the president and chief executive of the museum, what she's most excited about and her answer is parking and a new entrance.
15794	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's very important for visitors, and particularly for families, that they not feel crowded," says Kolb.
15795	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's scary enough to come into a city."
15796	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new Touch Me Museum is three miles away from the old building.
15797	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In an interview, Kolb doesn't even mention the building's architect.
15798	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's the parking we're moving for," says Kolb.

15801	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Old reliables, new surprises
15802	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	When the expanded Children's Museum reopens on April 14, there will be a little of the old, and a little of the new.
15803	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Here are a few familiar exhibitions, and a few potentially exciting new stops.
15804	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The old
15805	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant to send a signal to children that the building might look different, but it's still their children's museum.
15806	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Boats Afloat, with its mini-system of canals and riverways, hasn't moved from the second floor, and hasn't been redone.
15807	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There used to be two mock supermarkets on the third floor.
15808	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	One is gone, but the Colmado has been restocked, and is pretty much the way it was.
15809	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new
15810	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	KidPower, in the front atrium on the ground floor, gives children a chance to launch tennis balls by pulling a rope attached to a bowling ball.
15811	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	They can also move a sign up and down by using hand-pedaled bicycles.
15812	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The three-story New Balance Climb has levels that are meant to resemble flying carpets.
15813	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The device also offers one of the museum's best views - if you're willing to climb for it.
15814	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The famous outdoor Milk Bottle (left) has been rebuilt, and a series of mazes - made of rock and brick - have been installed on a new plaza.
15815	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Later this year, kids will be able to climb through a series of boulders installed in the area.
15816	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GEOFF EDGERS
15817	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	THIS LOSS REALLY HURTS
15818	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
15819	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	On a positive note, the Dodgers won't have to experience a home opener the rest of the season.
15820	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may not spare them outfielders being eaten up by the expanded, all-color advertising/scoreboard walls, or pitchers limping off the field because they didn't down enough sports drink, but at least they won't have to suffer any more ignoble openers.
15821	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kids skipped school for this.
15822	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Lawyers emptied downtown glass skyscrapers and billed phony hours for this.
15823	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	People fibbed and played hooky, and a few even legitimately took the day off for this.
15824	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's an L.A. tradition.
15825	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	A local celebration.
15826	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers and a weekday afternoon home opener.
15827	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Only the Dodgers looked flat, lost the game 6-3 to the Rockies, lost two of their starting nine to injury and momentarily lost the momentum built after sweeping the evil Giants up north.
15828	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Hey, but it was sunny and reasonably warm and the new parking scheme didn't turn into Chavez Ravine road rage and they still served Dodger Dogs.
15829	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, on to the next one.
15830	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers never led this one, and the game was pretty much devoid of dramatics.
15831	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	They almost seemed to treat the opener as this little requirement that had to be dealt with before moving on to other things, like the other 80 home games.
15832	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There was plenty of pregame pomp and festivities, but in the end a lot of bunting left hanging around another loss.
15833	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"We're glad it's over with," said Dodgers manager Grady Little.
15834	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Mostly Little was glad the initial medical reports on outfielder Matt Kemp and right-hander Jason Schmidt were less than frightening.
15835	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Little said before the game that Kemp and Andre Ethier were not in an official platoon in right field, but in competition for the full-time job.
15836	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Some competitions last longer than others.
15837	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp has been off to a solid start, but in the fourth inning he chased a drive by Jeff Baker to the wall in right.
15838	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The drive hit the wall at about the same time as Kemp.
15839	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	This is a new wall, one that oddly doubles as a scoreboard, or streamlined video board.
15840	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The video board is about double the size of last season's out-of- town scoreboard.
15841	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's filled with stats and advertising, like the promise of "Oceans 13" coming June 8, or about the time I normally write off the Dodgers.
15842	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's covered in plexiglass, which supposedly gives, but apparently not too much.
15843	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit an area that would have been padded last year -- the padding added years ago after Darryl Strawberry separated his shoulder crashing into the wall.
15844	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I got hops like Jordan, I jumped so high," Kemp said.
15845	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit the video wall with his right shoulder and fell in a clump.
15846	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Pain flashed through his shoulder and he feared serious injury.
15847	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"At first I thought it was worse than it was," he said.
15848	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp left the game and was taken to a local hospital for X-rays.
15849	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Seasons had gotten off to better starts.
15850	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	New Dodgers trainer, and former Giants trainer, Stan "No Relation" Conte said X-rays were negative, revealing no fractures or apparent dislocation, but more would be known today.
15851	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers veteran second baseman Jeff Kent remained understandably skeptical about the logic of a video-board outfield wall.
15852	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about that," Kent said.
15853	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"Plexiglass?
15854	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may have to go.
15855	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't think guys are going to want to climb that."
15856	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Then in the top of the fifth, Nomar Garciaparra bobbled a Kazuo Matsui grounder for an error.
15857	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, covering first, immediately grabbed the back of his right hamstring after hitting the bag.
15858	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodger hearts dropped.
15859	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, the Dodgers' $47 million offseason acquisition, also left the game, though Conte later said the right-hander was simply dehydrated and cramped.
15860	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is expected to make his next start.
15861	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"He'll be fine," Little said.
15862	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt both allowed and received his first Dodger home runs in the opener.
15863	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	He gave up a first-inning home run to Garrett Atkins, but then provided the Dodgers with their only power of the day, hitting a solo shot off Jeff Francis in the third.
15864	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It was that kind of goofy, not-quite-together opener.
15865	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Things got off to a less than auspicious start when the two F-16s from Edwards Air Force Base that were supposed to fly over as the climax of the opening ceremony flew over Dodger Stadium before the anthem was even sung.
15866	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers took the field with Wilson Valdez at shortstop for the injured Rafael Furcal and Ramon Martinez at third for Wilson Betemit.
15867	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Betemit is healthy but erratic, and that Dodgers commitment to him at third lasted a whole five games.
15868	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There were several small moments to make the Dodger faithful nervous -- Juan Pierre unable to throw a runner out at the plate on a ball so shallow Kent almost could have gotten there

15873	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Still, it was one game.
15874	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers had also lost their season opener at Milwaukee.
15875	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	For now at least, this messy opener business was behind them.
15876	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	For openers, better games await.
15877	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	EMBARGOED FOR THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 2007 KEEP STUDENT ATHLETES POWERED
15878	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
15879	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- During the recent NCAA Final Four weekend, I participated in a sports information panel for parents whose children want to play basketball at the college level.
15880	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Here are some of their questions that may help other parents of young athletes.
15881	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Q: How do the nutritional needs of a 13-year-old middle school athlete differ from those of a college athlete?
15882	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	A: There are several differences, but the biggest difference is that the 13-year-old is still growing and maturing (although I have seen some college players sprout several inches between their freshman and sophomore years).
15883	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Girls need at least 1,700 calories a day and, depending on practice and competition schedule, up to 2,800 calories.
15884	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Boys need between 2,000 and 3,800 calories a day.
15885	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Adolescent athletes also have greater needs for iron, calcium and vitamin D. School-age athletes need help from their parents in planning and packing snacks.
15886	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	It is not unusual for an adolescent to have an 11 a.m. lunch period, with practice at 4 p.m.
15887	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	That child will need a snack before practice to help keep his or her energy level high.
15888	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Peanut butter sandwiches, yogurt, fruit, crackers and juice can be carried in a gym bag or backpack for a pre-workout snack.
15889	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Q: My daughter doesn't like milk, so how can she get the calcium she needs?
15890	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	A: If she is not able to tolerate the milk sugar, or lactose, she can try yogurt or hard cheeses as these have low levels of lactose.
15891	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	If she just doesn't like milk, there are other good sources of calcium including green vegetables (collards, turnip greens, kale and broccoli), beans (navy, baked, great northern, kidney and black), blackstrap molasses, soy nuts, figs and almond butter.
15892	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	An orange has about 50 milligrams of calcium, and so does a handful of almonds.
15893	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	She could also drink calcium-fortified orange juice, rice milk or soymilk.
15894	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Q: My son plays basketball and is 6-foot-2 and still growing.
15895	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	He is hungry all the time.
15896	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	What can I feed him?
15897	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	A: This is a typical lament from a mom of a growing athlete - I often think the household food bills must go down drastically when a young athlete goes off to college!
15898	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Three meals and three snacks are a must.
15899	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Many young athletes don't eat much during the day and therefore are starving at night.
15900	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Plan to feed your son calorie- and nutrient-dense foods - that means a lot of calories and nutrients in smaller volume.
15901	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Examples are cream soups
15902	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	potato, chicken or tuna salads
15903	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	nuts and trail mix
15904	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	dried fruit
15905	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	peanut butter
15906	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	and cheese.
15907	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Milkshakes or smoothies are also calorie-rich.
15908	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Q: I coach an after-school basketball team.
15909	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	The kids come dragging into practice after school - is there a magic-bullet food they can eat to keep their energy level high?
15910	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	A: Everyone wants the magic bullet, but unfortunately, there isn't one.
15911	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	However, I suggest that every child involved in after- school sports carry an "energy pack" in his gym bag.
15912	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	This pack could include a bottle of frozen sports drink (it will still be nice and cold before practice), an energy bar (or granola or cereal bar) and a fruit cup.
15913	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	That will give budding basketball stars needed fluid, carbohydrates, B vitamins and sodium to help power them though practice.
15914	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	Chris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., is a professor of nutrition in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Georgia State University.

15918	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON SEEKS A WAY TO SHOUT, 'COME VISIT'
15919	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
15920	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	In its hunt for slogans to lure tourists, the nation's capital has never lit on the elegance of a "Virginia Is for Lovers" or the panache of a "What Happens Here, Stays Here."
15921	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"A Capital City" was fine for awhile, until Washington's high murder rate in the late 1980s produced an unwanted double meaning.
15922	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	And while residents lined up for "Taxation Without Representation" license plates in 2000, that tagline was more local protest than tourist come-on.
15923	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	This time, the District of Columbia is taking a more studious approach.
15924	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Tourism officials have hired two brand research firms to convene focus groups and conduct international surveys of attitudes toward the capital.
15925	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	In addition, a Web site, shareyourdc.com, invites the city's 582,000 residents -- and anyone else, for that matter -- to propose slogans and take part in weekly polls.
15926	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This isn't a few people sitting around a room saying, 'Hey, let's come up with this slogan,"' said Dan Mesches, president of Star Restaurant Group and chairman of the city's Brand Strategy Task Force, a panel of local leaders in business, travel and the arts.
15927	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This is an extensive and exhaustive search for what people in town are thinking and what people out of town are thinking."
15928	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	A sampling of submissions range from sober epigrams like "The City of National Monuments" to playful one-liners like "It's Capital, by George" and "Your Party's Here!"
15929	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Local blogs have been flooded with more irreverent proposals.
15930	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"Mistakes Were Made," "Where Attorneys Roam" and "Dude, Where's My Car?"
15931	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	are some of the printable ones.
15932	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said he wanted a catchphrase that braids the themes of "unity, energy and renaissance."
15933	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"You want to have a slogan where people just say, 'That's what I think about when I think about the nation's capital,"' said Fenty, 36, who took office in January as the city's youngest mayor.
15934	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"We want it to touch people.
15935	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	We want it to resonate with people.
15936	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	We also want it to have a high degree of accuracy."
15937	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	With the White House, the Capitol and oceans of white marble monuments and museums, Washington has rarely wanted for busloads of fifth-graders on field trips or families on a been-there-done- that weekend of sightseeing.
15938	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	In 2005, the last year of available figures, some 15 million visitors spent $5 billion here, generating $543 million in tax revenue for the city.
15939	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Though the search for a slogan has captured the most attention, it is part of a larger "branding" initiative to spice up the city's image.
15940	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Victoria Isley, a tourism official here, said the campaign, set to start in the fall, would try in part to sell higher-income visitors on the "D.C. beyond C-Span" -- a growing arts and nightlife scene, newly vibrant neighborhoods and a crop of new hotels, theaters and restaurants.
15941	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"There is an old stereotype that I think still exists -- that Washington is not that fun, it closes after dark, it's a one-note town," said Keith Bellows, editor in chief of National Geographic Traveler and an adviser to the brand task force.
15942	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"If you want to broaden people's perspective, you need to take a different tack."
15943	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	At his gallery in the Georgetown neighborhood, Keith Lipert, in a sharp blue bow tie, put his hand to his chin as he mulled the question of a new slogan.
15944	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"To me, it would be something along the lines of, 'Rediscover Washington,"' Lipert said.
15945	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This city in the last 10 years has gone through remarkable changes: great music, great theater, great restaurants."
15946	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Across town, in the hard-luck neighborhood of Anacostia, people said jobs, safe streets and affordable housing were more pressing than a new catchphrase.
15947	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"'A Capital City,"' proposed Juan Lyles, 56, a computer operator waiting for a bus.
15948	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"But meaning money, rather than the capital."
15949	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	With neighborhoods gentrifying and high-priced condos popping up across the city, Lyles said, "it's getting out of reach of most of the indigenous population."
15950	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	INSURER SEEKS BIG CAPE HIKE HOME INSURER SEEKS 25% HIKE ON CAPE
15951	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The state's home insurer of last resort told state regulators Friday that a 25 percent increase in its base rate on Cape Cod would be a major step toward covering the company's costs, but added that it is receptive to offering premium reductions to consumers who install hurricane shutters and roof tie-downs or accept higher deductibles.
15952	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Massachusetts Fair Plan's rate request, which follows the approval of a similar-size increase in October, faced near-united opposition from the attorney general, several Cape lawmakers, and a number of homeowners who came from the Cape to testify.
15953	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	They called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic meltdown on the Cape.
15954	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"When you add the high cost of home insurance to the high cost of housing, you're going to cripple the market and eventually the state," said Harvey Baumann, a retired surgeon from Wellfleet.
15955	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
15956	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Premiums have been rising quickly in those areas because a handful of little-known companies that use computer models to forecast the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes have dramatically raised their damage estimates.
15957	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	These estimates have had a ripple effect throughout the insurance industry.
15958	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Reinsurers, the companies that insure insurance companies against catastrophic events, have raised their rates substantially.
15959	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
15960	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Some companies have decided the risks are too great on the Cape and either reduced their exposure there or walked away, leaving homeowners with no choice for insurance but the Fair Plan.
15961	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
15962	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of them have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the homes on the Cape and islands.
15963	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan, which operates as an independent company but is financially backed by all of the state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
15964	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's current base premium on the Cape is $1,155 and would rise to $1,444 if the pending rate increase is approved.
15965	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's average premium on the Cape is currently $1,500.
15966	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Jack Golembeski, chief executive of the Fair Plan, said he averaged the damage forecasts of the two leading models in developing his company's proposed rates.
15967	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said the Fair Plan is seeking a 25 percent increase in its base rate on the Cape and islands, New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County except for Brockton.
15968	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said rates should be higher, but have been adjusted downward to prevent rate shock.
15969	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said the numbers indicate a 75 percent increase in New Bedford is warranted.
15970	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Jane Logan, an insurance broker from Sandwich, said she doesn't understand why rates are so much higher on the Cape than in Boston, which is also on the water.
15971	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	She also charged that the modeling companies operate under the influence of insurers and are churning out estimates that benefit them.
15972	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Other members of the insurance industry question the accuracy of the models, too.
15973	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	James M. Stone, chairman of Plymouth Rock Co. of Boston, said in a recent letter to shareholders that he worries the hurricane models are biased toward higher damage projections.
15974	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"I worry that all of these models, though well-intentioned, are biased upward in the states where events are fewest and actual data therefore most sparse," Stone wrote.
15975	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"Rating agencies and the modelers themselves have more to lose by underestimating the risk in seldom-hit locations than overestimating it."

15979	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They made Caracas into Calcutta," the Venezuelan writer Fausto Maso lamented in the epilogue of a recently reissued memoir of bohemian exploits in the 1970s and 1980s along Sabana Grande, the tree-lined boulevard that once symbolized this city's effervescent intellectual life.
15980	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
15981	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
15982	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But at the beginning of this year, buoyed by President Hugo Chavez's re-election victory, the local government allied with him responded to the many complaints about the area and cleared the vendors out.
15983	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedestrians have flowed back, giving hope of renewal to many people in the area.
15984	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"This place has gone from being an area in which you risked your life to something approaching pleasurable," said Ramon Martinez, a waiter at a restaurant on the boulevard for the last four years.
15985	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
15986	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Citing morgue records, newspapers here reported 265 killings last month, which would make it one of the deadliest in the city's recorded history.
15987	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The police disputed the figure, saying that there were 169 killings.
15988	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	In Sabana Grande, pickpockets flourished under the vendors' plastic tarps, where products like pharmaceuticals of dubious origin, smuggled Colombian lingerie or pirated Hollywood DVDs were available.
15989	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Considered a contingent of Chavez's urban political base, the vendors had for several years successfully prevented the authorities from removing them or collecting taxes.
15990	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the boulevard's exclusive shops and outdoor cafes had shut down, as their customers avoided the area.
15991	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Before the efforts began to restrict them, the city had about 150,000 of these vendors, according to Cedice, a research organization.
15992	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors have created an anarchic feel to many streets and plazas, including hundreds perched around the National Assembly downtown, fueling criticism of a government that preaches socialism but tolerates unfettered capitalism on its streets.
15993	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"The government should be ashamed to be walking hand in hand with Cuban socialism without acknowledging there are no street vendors nor anything even remotely similar in Havana," the newspaper El Nacional said in an editorial.
15994	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"At least they should use Cuba as an example in this respect."
15995	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Along Sabana Grande, whose name refers to a region of savannas and tabletop mesas in southern Venezuela, the facades of Art Deco apartments remain crumbling or covered in grit.
15996	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Squatters have occupied some abandoned buildings.
15997	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But the police are more visible, and mimes and street musicians now attract growing crowds.
15998	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	A few reminders of the boulevard's past survive, like Suma, a cavernous bookstore, and the open-air Gran Cafe.
15999	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Clearing out the vendors has also started a debate about the boulevard's future, with fervent supporters of the president trying to transform it into an area for discussing the direction of Venezuelan politics.
16000	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"The vendors have a right to work, but they should be given the opportunity to do something more creative," said Janette Rodriguez while passing out copies of La Mancha, a leftist newspaper.
16001	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
16002	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Whatever their political stripe, urban planners are enthusiastic about reinvigorating what is considered the city's premier public space.
16003	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
16004	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Unlike other Latin American capitals that were seats of colonial power, Caracas was long a backwater.
16005	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Then oil wealth paid for the services of Maurice Rotival, the French urban planner who developed the city's master plan, and of Robert Moses, New York's master builder, who advised Caracas on its freeway system.
16006	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching transformation, though, after migration surged from other regions.
16007	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
16008	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
16009	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle with each other outside."
16010	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
16011	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Critics of the municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic because it took place only after the president won re-election in December.
16012	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Freddy Bernal, mayor of the district encompassing the boulevard, said political allegiances were not a factor.
16013	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"This place does not belong to those who voted for President Hugo Chavez or those who did not," he said in a statement.
16014	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
16015	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	An earlier effort would have been difficult.
16016	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
16017	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
16018	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors say promises of government loans have gone unmet.
16019	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
16020	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."
16021	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's revolution.
16022	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedro Aponte, 72, a retired fruit seller, relied on nostalgia to discuss the boulevard's potential.
16023	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We have to conserve this place," said Aponte he set up chess sets a recent morning under an awning, where a growing crowd gathers each day to play.
16024	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Officials even organized a small Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.
16025	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls," Aponte reminisced.
16026	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They would smile," he said.
16027	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"That was beautiful."

16062	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	THE JERRY AND LARRY SHOW Fort Worth Star-Telegram American Atheists Inc. issued a predictable boo, instead of a boo-hoo, upon the Rev. Jerry Falwell's death Tuesday.
16063	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	The group called the architect of Moral Majority "a dangerous man who opposed and worked against many of the key values underpinning our secular American democracy."
16064	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	But let's give Falwell his due: His name stands for one of the Supreme Court's clearest pronouncements on First Amendment guarantees.
16065	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	Not that it's what he intended, mind you.
16066	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	But Falwell helped fortify constitutional protections for the very parodists and satirists who loved to take his name in vain.
16067	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	The case of Hustler v. Falwell surely was inspired by a comedy writer: sanctimonious bigot Jerry versus shameless pornmonger Larry, with a basic constitutional principle at stake.
16068	NYT_ENG_20070516.0053.LDC2009T13	In 1983, Hustler Publisher Larry Flynt decided to take on Falwell through a take-off on a series of Campari liqueur ads in which celebrities described their "first time"

16072	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	8 KILLED AS ISRAEL HITS A HAMAS POLITICIAN'S GAZA HOME Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem and Taghreed El-Khodary from Gaza City.
16073	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM -- The Israeli air force struck the home of a Hamas parliament member in Gaza on Sunday night, killing eight people, Palestinian hospital officials said.
16074	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The member of parliament, Khalil al-Hayya, was not in the house at the time.
16075	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The attack came hours after the Israeli government announced that it would intensify its military operations in Gaza in an effort to halt Palestinian rocket fire into Israel.
16076	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Separately, an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire reached on Saturday appeared to take hold in Gaza, after a week of fierce factional fighting between Fatah and its rival, Hamas.
16077	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	An Israeli army spokeswoman, Capt. Noa Meir, said that according to the army's initial findings, the army "identified and hit a five-member terrorist cell based on prior intelligence -- they were the target of the attack."
16078	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said that the dead included seven members of Hayya's family, including three of his brothers, and a neighbor.
16079	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Hayya, 44, who arrived at the hospital surrounded by supporters shortly after the attack, said that his brothers were "part of the Palestinian people" and had nothing to do with politics.
16080	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"This will not divert us from the resistance," he said.
16081	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Palestinian medical officials also said Sunday night that six children were wounded when an Israeli tank shell hit a house in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza.
16082	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"The tank fired at a point from which at least two rockets had been launched," Meir said.
16083	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"I want to emphasize that the rockets were being launched from officers' buildings in a civilian area."
16084	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Early on Sunday, Miri Eisin, spokeswoman for the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, had said that the focus of the Israeli military operations would be on Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the factions that have been the main perpetrators of the rocket attacks.
16085	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	She added that if the intensified operations were not successful, Israel's security Cabinet would consider "more drastic steps."
16086	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	She would not specify what the more drastic measures might include.
16087	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Israeli military operations in Gaza started after Hamas resumed rocket fire against Israel on Tuesday, but Israel's targets had been the cells firing the rockets or Hamas military headquarters.
16088	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Overnight, the Israeli air force struck members of a Hamas cell traveling in a car
16089	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	a vehicle carrying a large amount of explosives belonging to Hamas
16090	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	and three buildings where weapons were being produced, an army spokesman said.
16091	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Four Hamas militants were killed in the car, said medical officials at Shifa Hospital.
16092	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But on Sunday, at least 12 rockets landed in Israel, the army spokesman said.
16093	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Several hit the Karni crossing between Gaza and Israel, three fell in the Israeli border town of Sderot, causing damage but no casualties, and one set fire to a restaurant in a nearby kibbutz.
16094	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	More than 150 rockets have been launched at Israel since Tuesday, according to the army.
16095	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The Israeli government also said it would expedite the building of protected spaces in private homes for residents of Sderot, which has been hardest hit by the rocket fire.
16096	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The government's announcement on Sunday angered many Sderot residents, who said the action did not go far enough, Many were hoping that Olmert would order a re-invasion of the Gaza Strip, from which Israel withdrew in 2005, and some took to the streets in protest.
16097	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Mayor Eli Moyal has complained that in the six years since the rockets started falling on the town, the government has only managed to fortify schools and kindergartens, which have been closed for the past few days.
16098	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"The municipal sports center is not protected, nor is this," Moyal said on Thursday, referring to his own top-floor office in the modest City Hall.
16099	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Though the number of Israeli deaths from the crude and inaccurate rockets from Gaza has been relatively low -- eight civilians since 2001, according to the police -- Sderot's residents have been affected physically and psychologically by the continued threat, say social service professionals in the town.
16100	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"People are exhausted
16101	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	they don't sleep at night, and the tiredness magnifies all their other problems," said Limor Yashar, a social worker who runs programs for children at risk.
16102	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"People are sleeping under stairwells for protection, together with their children.
16103	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	There is no privacy.
16104	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Older children are wetting their beds, or will only sleep with the lights on."
16105	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The internal cease-fire reached in Gaza was the fifth in a week
16106	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	the previous ones have broken down after only minutes or hours.
16107	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	In Gaza City, schools, stores and businesses reopened Sunday and people resumed their lives after a week of self-imposed curfew because of the clashes.
16108	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But the atmosphere remained tense between Fatah and Hamas, which share power in a unity government that has come under strain.
16109	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Some of the heaviest fighting in the past week took place around the Al Nour building, a residential block of 52 apartments next to the headquarters of the Hamas police militia known as the Executive Force.
16110	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Nahidh Abu Rahma, 46, a lawyer who lives near the Al Nour building, said Sunday that he was skeptical about the chances for the latest cease-fire.
16111	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"Many were killed," he said of the factional clashes.
16112	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"You are talking here about revenge and reactions."
16113	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	He said he had decided to try to go to the United States to live.
16114	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Many local residents who witnessed the factional fighting said that the Islamist forces of Hamas appeared to be the more dedicated fighters, attributing that to their religious conviction.
16115	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Still, the consensus in Gaza was that there was no clear winner, a view backed by some Israeli security experts.
16116	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"It was a bit of a draw," said Jonathan Fighel, a colonel in the reserves who follows Palestinian movements at the Institute for Counter- Terrorism in Herzliya.
16117	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Fighel said that Israel still has not found a good technological answer to the primitive rockets from Gaza, and that the current military action, consisting of air strikes and some tank shelling, had been "more of the same, and ineffective."
16118	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Hamas is still highly motivated, he added, suggesting that Israel should "hit the Palestinians in a different dimension, to restore deterrence."
16119	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Israel, he said, had other options like cutting off electricity and water supplies to Gaza and killing high-ranking Hamas members, "including ministers."

16121	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	FRISCO
16122	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Kevin Millwood appears ready to rejoin the Rangers.
16123	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood allowed just one hit in five innings Sunday during a rehab assignment with the Double A RoughR iders at Dr Pepper Ballpark.
16124	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood, who threw 56 pitches (36 strikes) and didn't factor in the decision in a 2-1 win against the Tulsa Drillers, said his hamstring feels fine and he expects to be on the mound for the Rangers in Seattle on Friday.
16125	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I felt like I was putting it where I wanted to, for the most part," Millwood said.
16126	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I was mainly trying to make sure my pitch count got up and my hamstring felt fine."
16127	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood, who is 2-4 with a 6.62 ERA in 35 1/3 innings, injured his left hamstring May 14 in a start against the Angels.
16128	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Earlier in May he strained the hamstring during practice.
16129	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He's eligible to come of the disabled list Wednesday.
16130	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	After his first three pitches Sunday missed the strike zone, Millwood settled down and struck out the leadoff batter .
16131	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He allowed just two baserunners on a walk and a double.
16132	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He had three strikeouts and his fastball routinely hit 90-92 mph.
16133	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I felt a little out of sorts, but I think the biggest thing was just getting some pitches in," Millwood said. "
16134	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	(My pitches) were fine.
16135	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Nothing was horrible, so that was good.
16136	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	I threw my fastball wherever I wanted to, for the most part, and that's key for me."
16137	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Rangers bullpen coach Dom Chiti, who was with Millwood in Frisco, said the pitcher proved he's healthy.
16138	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I think he's ready to go," Chiti said.
16139	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Kevin showed everyone that he's healthy and his leg was fine.
16140	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	We started seeing the velocity, and he located (his pitches ).

16142	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Rangers outfielder Jerry Hairston was 1-for-4 Sunday with a line- drive homer to left field for Frisco.
16143	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston says the pain from a bulging disk, which was pinching a nerve in his neck and put him on the disabled list, has subsided.
16144	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	" (Sunday) was probably the best I've felt in a long time," he said.
16145	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Especially the last three at bats -- even the strikeout -- I felt great.
16146	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	It's just good to be back playing again."
16147	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston hopes to be back with the Rangers in Seattle after receiving a cortisone shot Tuesday and playing a game or two in Oklahoma City.

16149	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16150	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	President Bush has chosen Robert B. Zoellick, a senior diplomat and trade envoy who became a top Goldman Sachs executive last year, to lead the World Bank and try to heal the bitter rifts left by the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the administration said Tuesday.
16151	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that Zoellick had emerged as the first choice of economic ministers around the world, who have been calling for someone to overcome the bank's credibility problems among donor and recipient countries alike.
16152	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	"Bob has a very strong track record working with colleagues and leaders to get results," Paulson said in an interview after word of the appointment spread.
16153	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	"He's got great energy and enthusiasm and will be able to hit the ground running.
16154	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	I also think he's got strong management capabilities."
16155	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Zoellick, 53, has served in high-ranking foreign policy and economic policy posts under three Republican presidents, beginning with Ronald Reagan.
16156	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	His selection is to be officially announced by Bush on Wednesday.
16157	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He plans to visit the bank and meet with its staff almost immediately, administration officials said, and the bank's 24-member board of directors is to vote on the nomination soon afterward.
16158	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He faces an institution not only riven by the travails of Wolfowitz, who resigned earlier this month amid charges of favoritism, but also by major disagreements among donor nations over its future mission.
16159	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	The bank lends about $23 billion a year to poor countries and is the principal vehicle for grants and loans to the poorest among them.
16160	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	But the bank is also facing challenges in raising $30 billion over the next three years to renew its lending for the poorest countries.
16161	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Many rich countries had balked at new lending while Wolfowitz remained in charge.
16162	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Zoellick served for six years in the current Bush administration, as U.S. trade representative from 2001 to 2005 and then as deputy secretary of state until last July.
16163	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Under Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush, he held top posts at the Treasury and State departments.
16164	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He is known as tough, strong-willed, demanding and occasionally abrasive, but has built a broad network of admirers and allies around the world during his years in the government.
16165	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	RECONSIDERING, TORRE ADMONISHES RODRIGUEZ
16166	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	BOSTON
16167	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Politically, it would have been easy for Yankees manager Joe Torre to defend Alex Rodriguez for distracting a Toronto fielder by shouting as he ran past him on the bases Wednesday night.
16168	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But with two days to think about it, Torre admonished Rodriguez on Friday.
16169	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"It's probably something he shouldn't have done," Torre said before the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox.
16170	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"But it's over with.
16171	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	I don't sense he's going to do it again.
16172	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Just the reaction probably told him that.
16173	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	He may have been excited about the fact that we were leading the ballgame.
16174	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	It was probably inappropriate to do it at the time he did it.
16175	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But you can't change it, unfortunately."
16176	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told Rodriguez on the field that he had made a bush league play, something more appropriate for a Little Leaguer, and repeated those assertions to reporters after the game.
16177	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Several other Blue Jays were furious at Rodriguez.
16178	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"They were angry, no question," Torre said.
16179	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I can't say I blame them."
16180	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Torre, who gave a lukewarm defense of Rodriguez immediately after Wednesday's game, said he spoke with Rodriguez that night about the play.
16181	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I sensed from our conversation it won't happen again," Torre said.
16182	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez did not make himself available to reporters after Torre's comments, but the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson defended him.
16183	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Jackson, a special adviser who has spent considerable time around the clubhouse as the Yankees have struggled, said that Rodriguez was within his rights to distract Blue Jays third baseman Howie Clark from catching a pop-up.
16184	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"If it's not Alex Rodriguez, it's not a story," Jackson said.
16185	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Jackson broke up a potential double play in the 1978 World Series when he froze on the basepaths and turned his hip into a throw.
16186	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	He said he did it so the ball would not hit him in a more sensitive spot, but he also said that, like Rodriguez, he was denounced instead of praised for a play that helped his team.
16187	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"No over ever gave me credit for making a smart play, because I wasn't in favor," Jackson said.
16188	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"They said it was a cheap shot.
16189	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Now, A-Rod's not in favor.
16190	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	People won't appreciate him until he's done.
16191	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him.
16192	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	He comes to play every day."

16194	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	CHICAGO
16195	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Shark fin soup might taste good.
16196	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But it won't do much for cancer.
16197	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Shark cartilage, a widely used alternative therapy for cancer, did not help patients with lung cancer live longer, according to the results of one of the first rigorous studies of the approach.
16198	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But two smaller studies showed some preliminary but encouraging evidence that two other complementary therapies, ginseng and flaxseed, might have some benefit for cancer patients.
16199	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The studies were presented on Saturday here at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, where the nation's cancer doctors usually discuss the latest in chemotherapy and new biotechnology drugs.
16200	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It is relatively unusual for this meeting to highlight alternative therapies, but doctors here said that might be changing.
16201	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	They acknowledge that many of their patients are taking these supplements -- widely available in health food stores -- and asking them about them.
16202	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	So, they said, well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine whether these approaches are helpful or harmful.
16203	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks," said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University, who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.
16204	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
16205	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It tested a shark cartilage extract being developed as a drug by Aeterna Zentaris, a Canadian company.
16206	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Charles Lu of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the trial's lead investigator, said there was reason to believe the cartilage might work.
16207	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Cartilage has been found to contain factors that can impede the formation of blood vessels.
16208	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And cutting off the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with other drugs.
16209	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had died by that point.
16210	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Those who got a placebo had a median survival of 15.6 months.
16211	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
16212	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage extract was given as a liquid that the patients drank twice a day.
16213	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Results were somewhat more promising, though far less definitive, for flaxseed.
16214	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center, involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have their prostates removed.
16215	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	After the glands were removed about a month later, the tumors were studied.
16216	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It was found that the tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did not.
16217	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight fatigue, which is common in people with cancer.
16218	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The study involved 282 patients with various types of cancer.
16219	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	About one quarter of the patients who took one of the two higher doses of powdered extract of ginseng root, either 1,000 or 2,000 milligrams a day, reported that their fatigue had become "moderately better" or "much better."
16220	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That contrasted with only one 10th of those who took either a smaller amount of ginseng or a placebo.
16221	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Doctors said that it was too early to recommend that patients take flaxseed or ginseng, though they said the supplements were not harmful.
16222	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Debra L. Barton, an associate professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic and the lead investigator of the ginseng study, cautioned that many ginseng supplements do not use the Wisconsin ginseng used in the study.
16223	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And the quality and quantity of active ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
16224	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The investigators said the mechanisms of action of the flaxseed and the ginseng were not well understood.
16225	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Barton reverted to the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang in trying to explain ginseng.
16226	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"The theory is ginseng would help the body moderate the negative things going on," she said.
16227	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	In a more conventional study presented here, researchers in Europe found that preventive radiation therapy to the head reduces the risk that tumors will spread to the brain in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
16228	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The treatment also helped patients live longer.
16229	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of all lung cancer cases, but it is an aggressive type.
16230	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Previous studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small area.
16231	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
16232	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Only 14.6 percent of those who got the head radiation had symptoms from a spread of cancer to the brain a year later.
16233	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That compared with 40.4 percent in a control group.
16234	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Some 27.1 percent of the treated patients were alive a year later, twice as many as the 13.3 percent of the control group.
16235	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung cancer specialist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the study, said the findings would "change the standard of care almost immediately."

16242	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game.
16243	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	More than 40 people face criminal charges, mounds of documents have been seized and $6 million in cash has been confiscated.
16244	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed are some of the wealthiest and most powerful of the game's kingpins, as well as judges accused of issuing favorable rulings to keep the game running in return for payoffs, sometime as much as $15,000 a month.
16245	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Yet for all the talk of a crackdown, the game goes on.
16246	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	And to Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship between those who control the game and those who make and enforce the laws.
16247	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the 1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
16248	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering money," she added, "and contributes greatly to the problem of impunity in this country."
16249	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.
16250	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Players can bet on any combination of two-, three- or four-digit numbers, the last two digits of which are associated with any one of 25 animals, ranging from the alligator to the turkey.
16251	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The biggest payoff, $4,000 for a one-dollar bet, is awarded to those who "hit the thousand," or correctly pick a winning four-digit number.
16252	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"If I dream of a rooster, well then of course I'll bet on a rooster," said Silvio Cunha, who works as a doorman at an apartment building here.
16253	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"When my mother comes to visit, I bet on her flight number, and when I get my telephone bill I bet on that number too.
16254	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	You need always to be alert to numbers that can bring you luck."
16255	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The animal game was created in the 1890s by the owner of a zoo here as a way to promote his venture.
16256	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	It became almost instantly popular, which soon led the government, fearing that money would be drained away from official lotteries, to ban it.
16257	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	For decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent campaigns to snuff it out.
16258	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Finally, in 1946, the government outlawed casinos and games of chance, the animal game among them.
16259	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless it survives.
16260	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Today it is played everywhere in Brazil, including remote corners of the Amazon, but continues to be controlled from Rio by about a dozen bosses, called bicheiros.
16261	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Winning numbers are picked twice daily at a downtown building that serves as the syndicate headquarters.
16262	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The results are immediately sent to the thousands of betting points across the country.
16263	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Brazilian slang is peppered with references to the animal game.
16264	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros recur as characters in Brazilian films, novels and television programs, most recently on an HBO miniseries similar to "The Sopranos."
16265	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Numerous sambas have been written about the game.
16266	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In one of the most famous, "I Hit the Thousand," a lucky bettor exults at fulfilling the poor man's dream: "I won 500 smackers, and now I'm not going to work anymore."
16267	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Though many Brazilians are reluctant to acknowledge it, bicheiros also play a central, even essential, role in Carnival here.
16268	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Not only do they contribute the money that allows the samba "schools" to parade with elaborate floats and costumes, but they sometimes act as their "honorary presidents."
16269	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	This year and last, directors of samba schools were killed shortly before Carnival in what the authorities described as murders related to disputes about control of the animal game.
16270	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed in this most recent scandal was Ailton Guimaraes, president of the league of samba schools, who is said by authorities to be the animal game's boss of bosses.
16271	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Guimaraes, whose nickname is Captain -- his rank when he took part in military operations against left-wing guerrilla groups in the 1970s -- has declined several requests by The New York Times for interviews in recent years.
16272	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But at a court hearing in April he said that he was active in the animal game only between 1982 and 1993 and that he made his living now as a "financial consultant," earning commissions of as much as $200,000 a month from clients investing in the stock market.
16273	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He's the one who brought an organizational sense and structure to the game," said Frossard, the former judge, who has been the target of assassination attempts that she attributes to hired guns in the pay of game kingpins.
16274	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He also encouraged the group to try to capture the state, at all three levels of government and all three branches, instead of just paying off the police."
16275	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known here as "nickel hunters."
16276	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the leftist Workers' Party.
16277	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	When the party governed Rio Grande do Sul, the home state of Brazil's justice minister, animal game kingpins donated $500,000 for the purchase of the party headquarters there, a former party official said at a parliamentary inquiry.
16278	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	At one point a tape was played in which a party fundraiser could be heard urging the chief of police to go easy on numbers runners.
16279	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In 2004, a videotape surfaced in which one of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's top political operatives was seen offering to rewrite an online lottery contract to favor an animal game boss nicknamed Charlie Waterfall.
16280	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In return, the bicheiro promised to contribute more than $100,000 to the Workers' Party campaign and to pay a 1 percent commission to the official, who had to resign as a result.
16281	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterward, da Silva, who had originally favored legalizing the animal game, issued a temporary decree outlawing bingo parlors.
16282	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But the Senate refused to make the measure permanent.
16283	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros and their associates have obtained judicial rulings, many of them issued by judges later arrested, that have blunted the effect of the prohibition.
16284	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Da Silva's chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, has now indicated that the government is considering an about-face and is at least willing to study the possibility of legalizing the animal game.
16285	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"It's not a simple question," she said recently, but "it's obvious that as the investigations deepen, an institutional model for the question of games of chance is going to be delineated in Brazil."
16286	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Some Brazilians oppose legalization on moral grounds or because they fear that it would attract foreign crime organizations.
16287	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Others are simply skeptical.
16288	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"I'd wager that legalization is never going to happen," Luiz Carlos Menezes de Sa, a waiter, predicted after placing a 50-cent bet on 3568, a number associated with the monkey.
16289	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Without their bribes from the bicheiros, the politicians, cops and judges wouldn't be able to live high on the hog the way they do," he said.
16290	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Why would they want to do away with something that makes so much money for them?"
16291	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	AS JAPAN AGES, UNIVERSITIES STRUGGLE TO FILL CLASSES
16292	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	DAZAIFU, Japan
16293	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago, it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
16294	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
16295	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a brochure.
16296	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university's resortlike new dormitories also boast private karaoke rooms, an English garden with pink roses and a swimming pool.
16297	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot spring," Iwanaga, 21, said.
16298	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"They really wanted us to come here."
16299	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of higher education in Asia, but today its universities are scrambling to find new ways to attract students.
16300	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Years of falling birthrates have rapidly shrunk the population of young Japanese, leaving more universities unable to find enough students to fill their classrooms and campuses.
16301	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The rapid graying of Japan's population has already been felt in other parts of society, including the lower rungs of the nation's education system where hundreds of half-empty elementary and high schools have closed or been merged over the last two decades.
16302	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But it has only recently begun to affect higher education.
16303	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan's postwar baby boom started earlier than America's.
16304	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	As a result, according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers' children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to 1.3 million this year.
16305	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Estimates show it dropping to 1.21 million in two years.
16306	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	This year, as a result, nearly a third of the nation's 707 public and private four-year universities cannot fill all of their openings, according to the Education Ministry and university groups.
16307	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Roughly half of college-age Japanese attend universities.
16308	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Only three universities have gone bankrupt for lack of students.
16309	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Three years ago, Hiroshima's Risshikan University became the first Japanese university to fail since World War II.
16310	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But the Education Ministry and university groups are busily writing guidelines to help them deal with a retrenchment that few developed nations have had to face.
16311	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We are entering an era of survival of the fittest," said Yasuhiko Nishii, an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, the national association of private schools, including universities.
16312	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We need to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting the education of their students."
16313	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of prospective students, such as foreigners and "silver students," retirees who study for fun.
16314	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	In March, Osaka University gave a doctorate in mathematics to a 71-year-old former engineer who entered graduate school after retiring.
16315	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	At Fukuoka University of Economics, in this city on Kyushu, a southern island, administrators responded to the plunge in applications with a $50 million project in 1999 to build lavish dormitories, in which all 700 rooms are singles -- a luxury on Japan's traditionally Spartan campuses -- and are wired for the Internet.
16316	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has also halved tuition to 590,000 yen, or about $5,000.
16317	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The school also created a "celebrity business" major to train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative pursuits like music, rather than the "salaryman" positions sought by their parents' generation.
16318	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The prospect of universities fighting to win students has prompted national hand-wringing about the future of Japanese higher education.
16319	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Since the founding in 1877 of the nation's first modern university, the University of Tokyo, Japanese universities and their grueling entrance exams have been the society's main mechanism for sorting its youth, tracking the brightest into top business and government jobs.
16320	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many fear that this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards to attract more students.
16321	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a four-year break before entering the work force, some administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish.
16322	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Atsushi Hamana, president of Kansai University of International Studies in Miki, Japan, says that schools are realizing that young people actually want to study to get the skills to compete in a globalizing economy.
16323	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities realize they actually have to educate their students," Hamana said.
16324	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Another promising change has been an opening of Japan's doors to more foreign students, whose numbers have increased in recent years, but are still far fewer than in America.
16325	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, founded in 2000 in Beppu, a southern city, could be the shape of things to come in Japan.
16326	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Almost half its 5,421 students are from overseas, mainly China and South Korea.
16327	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign, including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
16328	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Half of the classes are taught in English.
16329	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university is also unusual in Japan because it has a full-fledged, American-style career office to help students find jobs.
16330	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has been rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
16331	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	What Japanese universities are desperate to avoid is a fate like that of Hagi International University, one of the three universities to fail because of too few students.
16332	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hagi converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year university in 1999 with grandiose plans of becoming the region's top school.
16333	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But from the beginning, it failed to attract its annual capacity of 300 freshmen.
16334	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The campus became increasingly empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to just three in 2006, the school said.
16335	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university first tried to fill its thinning ranks by recruiting in China, but the immigration authorities stopped that in 2002 after 26 Chinese students disappeared, apparently to work illegally in Japan, the university said.
16336	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Next, it hired a top professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
16337	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for bankruptcy in 2005.
16338	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We tried to find ways to attract new students," said Masanori Hatachi, the president of the university, which now has a new owner and a new name, Yamaguchi University of Human Welfare and Culture.
16339	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"Problem was, there just weren't a lot of new students to be found."
16340	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	After bankruptcy, the university was taken over by a construction company and revived in April as a smaller university offering degrees in the health field.
16341	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hatachi said the new focus should make it more competitive because in rapidly graying Japan, care for the elderly is one of the few guaranteed growth markets for young job seekers.
16342	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education," he said.
16343	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"A university has to be a place where students think they can learn what they need."

16346	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON-Legislation that would strengthen the beleaguered Freedom of Information Act had all the makings of what Capitol Hill politicos call a "hotline bill."
16347	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote.
16348	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	More than 100 groups from across the political spectrum support it.
16349	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The House approved a companion measure by a wide margin.
16350	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Yet, the bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sits in limbo.
16351	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The reason?
16352	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Arizona Republican Senator Jon Kyl.
16353	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that Kyl was the one who invoked a parliamentary procedure known as a "secret hold" last month to block the bill from sailing through the Senate without debate.
16354	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	With just one objection, the bill went from "hotline" status to a legislative black hole.
16355	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"I cannot overestimate the power of each U.S. senator," said Robert B. Dove, the former parliamentarian of the Senate.
16356	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	By placing the hold on the measure, Kyl is assured that nothing passes without his support, he said.
16357	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government advocates are blitzing Capitol Hill in a last- ditch effort to win approval for the measure before Congress recesses for the Fourth of July holiday-the 41st anniversary of the bill.
16358	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It is a shocking story that goes far beyond this particular bill," said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.
16359	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It really illustrates how Congress has become dysfunctional."
16360	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's hold on the Open Government Act eliminates majority rule in favor of the "idiosyncrasies of one individual," Aftergood said.

16362	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	So far, the open government groups -conservative and liberals included--have been unsuccessful in budging Kyl.
16363	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Cornyn-Leahy bill attempts to reduce the long backlog of FOIA requests by imposing consequences for missing the 20-day statutory deadline.
16364	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill establishes a FOIA hotline service to track requests and creates an ombudsman to settle disputes.
16365	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Jim Manley, spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said the measure would not be brought up for debate before the Fourth of July recess.
16366	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Senator Reid has worked hard to clear Republican objections and wants it to the floor as soon as possible," Manley said.
16367	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	In order to bring it to the floor for debate, Reid needs Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to sign off.
16368	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	To date, McConnell has not responded to a request to allow two hours of debate on the measure.
16369	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	An aide to McConnell said that the debate proposal did not permit discussion of Kyl's concerns.
16370	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Until those concerns are addressed, the bill will not move.
16371	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's a sad day in democracy when an open government bill does not see the light of day," said Rick Blum, director of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups.
16372	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	If Kyl has concerns, those concerns should be openly debated so the bill can move forward, Blum said.
16373	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's office did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment for this story.
16374	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	However, Kyl did list his objections to the bill in a Senate Judiciary Committee report filed in Congress.
16375	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl, a Judiciary Committee member, baffled open government groups because he objected in writing after allowing the measure to clear the committee by voice vote.
16376	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Although the goals of the Open Government Act are laudable, the bill reported by the committee has a number of flaws that must be addressed," Kyl said in his dissenting opinion.
16377	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.
16378	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl was concerned that the provision would inadvertently release sensitive information about national security.
16379	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Justice Department concurs, calling it a "Draconian remedy with enormous consequences" because it would lead to the automatic release of all information with only a few narrow exceptions.
16380	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Overall, Kyl's list of concerns mirrors the Justice Department's concerns.
16381	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	And Kyl objects to a provision that would allow requesters to seek attorneys fees when they challenge denials in federal court.
16382	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl said this would reverse a U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Buckhannon Board and Care Home v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Services.
16383	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The higher court ruled that a party suing the government is not entitled to attorney's fees if the government voluntarily changed its position and gave the plaintiff what he wanted.
16384	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government groups say this is an important provision.
16385	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	They have testified that agencies are routinely delaying the release of government records past the statutory 20-day deadline, forcing FOIA requesters to mount an expensive legal challenge to get the records.
16386	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Some have reported that they spend thousands of dollars in legal fees only to have the government cough up the records in the 11th hour.
16387	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have tried to address Kyl's concerns over the past month.
16388	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, personally appealed to Kyl, a fellow member of the panel, to no avail, according to a senior Democratic staffer.
16389	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have eliminated the provision that would bar agencies from asserting exemption to a FOIA request if they failed to meet the 20-day deadline set by law.
16390	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Staffers for Cornyn and Leahy say they are hopeful that Kyl will ultimately support the measure.
16391	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Senator Cornyn does not comment on private conversations he might have with other senators, but suffice to say, this bill is one of his top priorities," said Brian Walsh, spokesperson for Cornyn.
16392	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"He believes the Senate should act on this good government legislation as soon as possible."
16393	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law needs to be improved, Leahy said.
16394	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law is hampered by excessive delays and lax agency compliance, he said.
16395	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Today, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIA's 41-year history," Leahy said.
16396	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"This bill would help to reverse this trend and to restore the public's trust in their government."

16398	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	JAILED AND TORTURED, JOURNALIST STILL SEEKS JUSTICE IN LIBERIA
16399	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
16400	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Almost two years earlier, Bility, a journalist imprisoned and tortured by the regime of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, had fled Africa for Boston and heeded a resettlement official's advice to become a Red Sox fan.
16401	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Now he was spending his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather evidence against Taylor.
16402	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	At night he watched baseball with court officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
16403	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I told them we believe," Bility says.
16404	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"We always believe."
16405	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	What Bility believes in most is the power of an independent press.
16406	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In his native Monrovia, he was editor in chief of The Analyst, a newspaper that regularly reported on the violence and abuses of Taylor's presidency, both in Liberia and in the arms- for-diamonds war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
16407	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the most outspoken and courageous journalists in Liberia," says Joshua Rubenstein, New England director of Amnesty International.
16408	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor, who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone.
16409	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."
16410	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close.
16411	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He suffers hearing loss in his left ear after being beaten badly in 1997 during his first arrest.
16412	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His elbows bear scars from the aftermath of his seventh and final arrest: For six months in 2002 his jailers often tied his elbows behind his back until they touched each other
16413	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
16414	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He's regained feeling in an arm numbed by the torture, but his shoulder still bothers him.
16415	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He is a reluctant refugee, the subject of an international campaign for his release by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the US government.
16416	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He resisted Taylor's insistence that he accept exile once freed but acquiesced after a prison guard passed him a note from his mother imploring him to agree to flee.
16417	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was whisked from a Liberian prison to Ghana in December 2002, then resettled in Boston in early 2003.
16418	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He now speaks and writes about his troubled homeland.
16419	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Boston-educated Taylor, the first African head of state to be charged with war crimes, refused to attend the opening of his trial before the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone earlier this month.
16420	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and is expected to last at least a year.
16421	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor was president of Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in 2003.
16422	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape, mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its abundant natural resources.
16423	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.
16424	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He returned in 1984, after being charged with embezzling Liberian government funds, only to be arrested here.
16425	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He escaped from the Plymouth House of Corrections in 1985 while awaiting extradition.
16426	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Staying strong
16427	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility traces his interest in journalism to the unrest that swept his native country after President Samuel K. Doe was killed in 1990.
16428	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I had witnessed a lot of abuses, a lot of murders.
16429	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I thought the Liberian media wasn't reporting what was happening, either from fear or censorship," he says.
16430	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I felt it was necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
16431	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	During this period of chaos, West African peacekeepers managed to ring off the capital city of Monrovia, says Binaifer Nowrojee, former legal counsel for Human Rights Watch Africa.
16432	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Remarkably, in that little safe haven, Liberia went from having no human rights community to having a thriving human rights community.
16433	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says.
16434	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"In the human rights community he was very much a household name."
16435	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility was first arrested the year Taylor was elected president.
16436	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on trial.
16437	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"That issue was taboo," Bility recalls.
16438	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I reported on it extensively.
16439	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	My colleagues said, 'You are reckless.
16440	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That guy could kill you.'
16441	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That was the battle line."
16442	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was released after two days without having been charged.
16443	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
16444	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There he reported on gang rapes, mass arrests, and executions.
16445	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
16446	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Government agents pretending to peddle a corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4 -year-old son.
16447	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to Taylor's home, Bility recalls.
16448	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Charles Taylor introduced me.
16449	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	'Gentlemen, this is the guy who wants to overthrow me,"' Bility says.
16450	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He is sitting at his desk.
16451	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is sitting on the floor.
16452	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He said, 'Have a seat.'
16453	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I sat on a chair.
16454	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A minister said, 'What are you doing?
16455	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Do you compare yourself to the president?"'
16456	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility denied Taylor's assertions that he was smuggling arms into Liberia and arranging for the president's assassination.
16457	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He spent the next six months incommunicado in various prison cells, including one underground hole only 3 feet high and half-filled with water.
16458	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
16459	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
16460	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was sitting in a room with government agents who had been drinking, one, a renowned marksman, poured Scotch down Bility's throat, then balanced the Dewar's bottle on the blindfolded prisoner's head.
16461	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
16462	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"If I had a heart condition," Bility says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
16463	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once Taylor visited him in prison.
16464	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
16465	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He looked up and said, 'My birds.'
16466	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That scared me."
16467	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Through all this, Bility never made a false confession.
16468	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
16469	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His first inkling that his plight had attracted international attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong.
16470	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
16471	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"From that day on I had hope."
16472	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Coming to Boston
16473	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The torture stopped, and for two months Bility's captors worked to make him presentable to the outside world.
16474	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They sent a doctor.
16475	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They cut his thick, matted hair.
16476	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He refused to go into exile.
16477	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
16478	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Once the US government was involved and Amnesty was involved, there was no way."
16479	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Finally, Bility agreed to leave Liberia.
16480	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	American resettlement officials suggested he would like Washington or Boston.
16481	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
16482	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	And he had heard of the Celtics.
16483	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In January 2003, Bility moved to Massachusetts.
16484	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He neglected advice to seek counseling to help him recover from the torture he'd suffered.
16485	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I thought I really didn't need it.
16486	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I was completely traumatized.
16487	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Each time I would see a police officer my heart would pump up," he says.
16488	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"What helped me was to speak about it.
16489	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The more I spoke about it, the less stressful it became, and things became normal."
16490	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Like many other Liberians, Bility is hopeful that President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will bring progress.
16491	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility wants more, however.
16492	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He wants Taylor held accountable not only for the atrocities he committed in Sierra Leone but also for those he committed in Liberia.
16493	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"You cannot build a viable democracy," he says, "without justice being the solid foundation."
16494	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	FED, STILL WARY ON INFLATION, LEAVES A KEY RATE UNCHANGED
16495	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16496	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time.
16497	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
16498	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."
16499	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory.
16500	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated," the central bank said.
16501	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The biggest question was how policymakers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
16502	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	For the past several years, Fed governors including Ben S. Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the "core" rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to 2 percent a year.
16503	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
16504	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
16505	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Fed policymakers are in no rush to reduce interest rates.
16506	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
16507	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.
16508	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
16509	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	' UNCHECKED AND UNBALANCED ' : THE CASE AGAINST THOSE EXPANDING WHITE HOUSE POWERS
16510	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Days after 9/11, Bush administration lawyers began laying out a vision of sweeping executive power, designed to give the president authority, in the words of John C. Yoo, then deputy assistant attorney general, "to take whatever actions he deems appropriate to pre-empt or respond to terrorist threats from new quarters," whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidents of Sept. 11.
16511	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	A Sept. 25, 2001, Justice Department memo declared that under the Constitution decisions regarding the "amount of military force to be used" in response to the terrorist threat, as well as "the method, timing and nature of the response," are "for the president alone to make."
16512	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."
16513	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
16514	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without obtaining a court order on calls and e-mail messages sent from the United States to other countries.
16515	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	He has issued a steady stream of signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority to limit coercive interrogation tactics.
16516	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And the administration has claimed that the president's war powers give him the authority to detain people indefinitely and deny them access to lawyers and the courts, policy that it would later be forced to modify in response to legal challenges.
16517	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In their chilling and timely book Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, and Aziz Z. Huq, who directs the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center, argue that the Bush administration's "monarchist claims of executive power" are "unprecedented on this side of the North Atlantic," and that its "executive unilateralism not only undermines the delicate balance of our Constitution, but also lessens our human liberties and hurts vital counterterrorism campaigns" by undermining America's moral authority and standing in the world.
16518	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe.
16519	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	But the book serves as a valuable compendium and chronicle of the Bush administration's aggressive efforts to expand the power of the executive branch, providing a detailed account of the unilateral actions it has taken on matters ranging from torture policy to domestic surveillance, and it is necessary reading for anyone interested in how those efforts by the Bush White House have tipped the constitutional system of checks and balances.
16520	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Schwarz was chief counsel for the Church committee, which investigated executive branch overreaching in the mid 1970s, and he and Huq have done a powerful job of situating the actions of the current White House in perspective with the imperial presidency of Richard M. Nixon (who once declared that "when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal").
16521	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
16522	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	They remind the reader that the founding fathers had "scant affection for strong executives" like England's king, and they argue that many of the Bush White House's claims are rooted in ideas "about the 'divine' right of kings" that "did not survive the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution of 1688" and that certainly did not find their "way into our founding documents, the 1776 Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of 1787."
16523	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Like many reporters Huq and Schwarz point out that expanded executive power was not a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 but the realization of a vision that conservatives like Dick Cheney had harbored since the 1970s, when they grew aggrieved over post-Watergate reforms that put the brakes on presidential power.
16524	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	That conservative backlash gained ground during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in the minority report of the Iran-contra committee.
16525	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	(The committee included Cheney and counted among its staff a young lawyer named David S. Addington, who years later in his role as the vice president's legal counsel and chief of staff would play a major role in formulating the administration's post-9/11 legal strategy.)
16526	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	According to Huq and Schwarz the Iran-contra committee's minority report asserted that "the Chief Executive will on occasion feel duty bound to assert monarchical notions of prerogative that will permit him to exceed the laws," and it also argued that "the President's inherent powers" had historically allowed the executive to act "when Congress was silent, and even, in some cases, where Congress had prohibited an action."
16527	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	As Schwarz and Huq see it, the Bush White House's "broader efforts to seize unfettered control of national security policy and to eliminate the checks and balances imposed by Congress and the courts" is exemplified by its post 9/11 decision "to ignore legal constraints on torture."
16528	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In February of 2002 President Bush signed an order declaring that "none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world," a decision that would set the nation on a slippery slope toward torture, leading to the abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons.
16529	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately narrow definition of torture.
16530	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	One 2002 memo defined it as causing the sort of "intense pain or suffering" ordinarily associated "with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result."
16531	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although significant public and congressional attention was focused on the Patriot Act (which itself created an uproar over the threat it posed to Americans' civil liberties), Huq and Schwarz write, "the official responses to the September 11, 2001, attacks largely took shape through under-the-radar executive orders" that not only excluded Congress from the debate but in many cases also circumvented the interagency policy-making process, cutting out experts from the State Department and members of the uniformed military.
16532	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	For instance the authors observe that a presidential finding signed days after 9/11 gave the CIA sweeping new powers to disrupt terrorist activity and permission to kill, capture and detain members of Al Qaida anywhere in the world: powers, in the view of some intelligence officers, that included the implicit authority to create black sites (secret detention facilities outside the United States, where terrorism suspects could be held beyond the Bush's signing of a 2002 presidential order authorizing NSA surveillance in the homeland without a court- approved warrant, an order that effectively circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed by Congress in 1978.
16533	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although briefings were provided to a handful of congressional leaders, Schwarz and Huq report, those leaders were prohibited from saying anything about them to anyone, including other intelligence committee members, a stipulation that "gutted the possibility of effective oversight."
16534	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Making the executive supreme makes the nation no safer -- either from its enemies or its own worse impulses," the authors conclude.
16535	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Indeed, the abiding genius of the Founding Generation was its rejection of the idea that unchecked unilateral power is ever properly vested in any one branch of government.
16536	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Our government was framed 'to control itself,' as James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers.
16537	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	'Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'
16538	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Dividing powers between three branches, the Founders harnessed human passions in the cause of limited government.
16539	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."'

16548	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Venezuela's oil industry wants foreign partners to help tap its vast resources, but they need not come knocking if they want to call the shots, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday in Houston.
16549	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez Herrera said Venezuela is continuing compensation talks with major oil companies that walked away from their multibillion-dollar Venezuelan operations last month rather than agree to terms of relinquishing control in the face of President Hugo Chavez's nationalization of oil operations.
16550	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	But those who stay -- or come later -- will do so with Venezuela's government-controlled oil company in charge, Alvarez told the Houston Chronicle editorial board.
16551	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that rule," he said.
16552	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Later, during an appearance at a Greater Houston Partnership luncheon, Alvarez was asked what Chavez wants to hear from the new U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
16553	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We are ready to respect Venezuela," Alvarez replied.
16554	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Patrick Duddy, a senior State Department official, recently was named to succeed outgoing ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield.
16555	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez is spending several days in Texas on a visit he said has focused more on making community contacts than on the energy business, though he conceded that it's "impossible to have a completely non-oil visit to Texas."
16556	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said he has not encountered hostility from Americans despite Washington's chilly relations with Chavez, a socialist who once likened President Bush to the devil.
16557	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
16558	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he has found Americans open to discussions about differences and common interests involving the United States and the South American nation.
16559	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	In May, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took over operations of major oil projects that had been run by Houston-based ConocoPhillips, Irving-based Exxon Mobil, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp. and Paris-based Total.
16560	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Most of the projects are in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco River basin, but ConocoPhillips also had an offshore project slated to begin producing next year.
16561	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.
16562	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Last month, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil refused to accept new working terms for their Venezuelan operations and walked away.
16563	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	PDVSA absorbed their stakes, and the companies are negotiating compensation for what they gave up.
16564	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chevron and Total agreed to stay on as PDVSA's minority partners.
16565	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	London-based BP and Norway's Statoil, which already were minority partners, also agreed to stay.
16566	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Analysts have valued the combined projects PDVSA took over at $25 billion to $30 billion.
16567	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	ConocoPhillips has announced plans to write off the entire $4.5 billion value of its Venezuelan assets in its second quarter results, but Exxon Mobil hasn't revealed its plans.
16568	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
16569	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said in the meeting with the Chronicle that he isn't worried that the takeovers will chill future investment or participation from foreign companies.
16570	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	While ConocoPhillips and Exxon left, others remain, he said, and more have been invited to explore and develop the Orinoco region, including Russia's Lukoil, Brazil's Petrobras, China's CNPC and India's ONGC.
16571	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	This week PDVSA announced that Venezuela and Iran will collaborate to spend $4 billion on a joint Orinoco project.
16572	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and Hispanics.
16573	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
16574	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said the aftermath may be more complicated than Alvarez suggests.
16575	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts could change in midstream.
16576	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, he said questions loom as to whether other companies have the know-how to successfully develop heavy oil projects and maximize production in the Orinoco, where estimated reserves could surpass those in Saudi Arabia.
16577	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.
16578	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"I think the government will have to recalibrate and re-evaluate its prospects unless it wants to run the risk of either pushing other companies out or failing to convince any new companies to step in."
16579	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, Esteruelas noted that in mid-May, the Venezuelan government said it might take over 18 oil rigs now operated by oil service companies and create a PDVSA subsidiary to tighten control of drilling operations throughout the country.
16580	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	That could prompt oil service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
16581	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
16582	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Its American assets -- notably five refineries run by its Houston-based subsidiary, Citgo -- could be targeted for seizure to compensate ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.
16583	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility.
16584	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
16585	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.
16586	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He also said that during his visit, he would meet privately with officials of Chevron and Citgo.
16587	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He had no meetings scheduled with ConocoPhillips or Exxon Mobil.

16608	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	So participants are taught to treat the clues as a "working hypothesis" that will evolve with future interactions.
16609	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who speaks in long, complex sentences and focuses on future possibilities, for example, is probably intuitive, a description based on the Jungian model of personality types.
16610	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	When dealing with such a person, emphasize the larger picture and avoid too many details.
16611	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who talks in short, concise sentences responds precisely to what is said, and uses down-to- earth speech is probably a so-called sensor.
16612	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Sensors are best reached by avoiding theories and stressing concrete benefits.
16613	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In many ways, consciously or not, all of us make these subtle tweaks in our communication styles all the time.
16614	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But we often do this by trial and error, and only after repeated personality conflicts that finally force a new approach.
16615	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	SpeedReading People aims to make this process instinctive and immediate, so we don't reach a point of exasperation before realizing that our method of communicating is at odds with someone else's.
16616	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's tough, it's an art, and most people learn through the course of their lives and personal interactions," said Rob Toomey, a former Boston lawyer who is vice president of SpeedReading People.
16617	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"We're just helping them learn it earlier and easier."
16618	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The program also cautions not to assume that someone you have trouble communicating with is simply dense or difficult.
16619	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That can lead to what Garrison, of Vertex, calls "unconscious incompetence," or unproductive interactions that inhibit progress and workplace success.
16620	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	At Vertex, which is hiring new employees at a rate of about one person per business day, innovation is critical to the company's mission of developing drugs that treat devastating diseases.
16621	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That means its workers must be able to communicate effectively with each another, since poor communication impedes innovation, Garrison said.
16622	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	For Dean Wilson, a chemistry research fellow at Vertex who recently completed the SpeedReading program, the training has already had workplace benefit.
16623	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	During a conversation with a coworker about a major change to a complicated laboratory process, Wilson, who describes himself as a theoretical thinker, realized that his detail-oriented colleague seemed to want a more step-by-step explanation.
16624	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"I was having a discussion on a very high conceptual level with a person who really needed a lot more detail and a more linear progression of ideas," recalled Wilson, 39, who has worked at the company for five years.
16625	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"So I essentially conveyed the same information but in a completely different way - from the details up instead of from the top down - and I think he gained a much better understanding of what I was getting at."
16626	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Many other behavior-training programs focus on helping participants identify personality types, particularly their own, but few emphasize the practical application of this knowledge.
16627	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	By having participants watch video interviews, role play, and use online tools, SpeedReading People teaches not only how to categorize other people's temperaments, but how to communicate more effectively with them.
16628	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some personality types are obvious.
16629	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Extraverts tend to be high- energy, outgoing, talkative people, so it's beneficial to communicate verbally with them and keep the conversation lively.
16630	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Introverts tend to be reserved, private, quiet, and introspective, so it's advantageous to communicate with them in writing first if possible and give them time to reflect.
16631	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Other communication differences are more nuanced.
16632	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a coworker who frequently questions your decisions, he may not simply be an aggressive jerk
16633	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	he may be an intuitive thinker who loves debate and wants to understand your thought process.
16634	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be assertive with him and avoid taking his remarks personally.
16635	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a boss who rarely smiles and never seems to break out of work mode, she may not be socially inept
16636	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	she may be a so- called sensor-judger who doesn't like to combine work and play.
16637	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be formal and direct with her.
16638	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Behavioral clues are best picked up in face-to-face interaction, which isn't always practical in this Internet era.
16639	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But even a highly detailed e-mail or a terse, clipped phone call can offer insights into another person's personality.
16640	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	And those insights are helpful in both personal and professional contexts, no matter what your family life or work situation.
16641	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's basically important for anyone for whom relationships are important," said Toomey, "and if that doesn't capture everyone, then there's something wrong."
16642	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	RATE HIKE LOOMS FOR MANY TEXAS ALLSTATE POLICYHOLDERS
16643	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
16644	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Allstate Texas Lloyds is raising home insurance rates 5.9 percent statewide, the company said Monday.
16645	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Coastal residents in counties once and twice removed from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Harris and Montgomery counties, will also see an additional average 2 percent rate hike.
16646	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	That's to help cover the cost of reinsurance, or insurance the company buys for itself to help pay for claims in the event of a catastrophe, the company said.
16647	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Residents of Galveston County and a sliver of Harris County will not be hit with the average 2 percent increase because the company dropped windstorm coverage in counties that touch coastal waters last year.
16648	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The rates will change on policies as they come up for renewal, Allstate said.
16649	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rising construction costs also contributed to the rate hike, the company said.
16650	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	About 700,000 of Allstate's 917,000 Texas policyholders are insured by Allstate Texas Lloyds.
16651	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Allstate withdrew a proposed 6.9 percent statewide increase in homeowners rates after the Texas Department of Insurance signaled that it wouldn't approve rates.
16652	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"Updated information indicated a slightly reduced rate change," said Bill Mellander, a spokesman for Allstate.
16653	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The range of rates coastal residents will pay was not available, he said.
16654	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies in Texas are allowed to implement their rate increases upon filing them with regulators without prior approval.
16655	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	However, regulators can disapprove the rates after they've been implemented and order refunds.
16656	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rod Bordelon, of the Texas Office of Public Insurance Counsel that represents consumers, said he anticipates the office will oppose the rates.
16657	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"I see no basis for any such increase," said Bordelon, the public counsel.
16658	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"We're still looking at it."
16659	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Jerry Hagins, the spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said Monday his office is reviewing the actuarial information to see if the hike is justified.
16660	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	He said that if Bordelon opposes the increase "that opinion has a great deal of weight to it."
16661	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Allstate stopped selling new homeowners policies in counties once removed from the coast -- such as Harris, Fort Bend and Liberty -- in March 2006 and dropped windstorm insurance for policyholders in September 2006 in counties that front the Gulf of Mexico.
16662	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Farmers which also withdrew proposed rate increases last month in anticipation of opposition from the state has yet to file a new proposal, a spokeswoman said.
16663	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	CIA REPORT DETAILS MISSTEPS BEFORE SEPT. 11 ATTACKS (SUBS FOR REWRITING THROUGHOUT.)
16664	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
16665	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
16666	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	A report released Tuesday by the Central Intelligence Agency includes new details of the agency's missteps prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, outlining what the report says were failures to grasp the role being played by the terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and to fully assess the threats streaming into the spy agency during the summer of 2001.
16667	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The 19-page report, prepared by the agency's inspector general, also says that between 50 and 60 CIA officers knew of intelligence reports in 2000 that two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hamzi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, may have been in the United States.
16668	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence of what it calls a systemic failure.
16669	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general recommended that several top agency officials, including former director George J. Tenet, be held accountable for their failure to implement a strategy to dismantle al-Qaida in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks.
16670	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the current CIA director, and his predecessor, Porter J. Goss, have declined to seek disciplinary action against Tenet and others named in the report.
16671	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The basic outlines of the report have been known since shortly after it was completed in 2005, but it had never been made public, and its release reignited a debate about whether the CIA should have done more before the attacks, and whether Tenet and other officials should be held accountable.
16672	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet called many of the report's conclusions "flat wrong," and Hayden noted that many of those criticized in the review by the agency's inspector general probe have criticized the "focus, methodology and conclusions" of the report.
16673	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.
16674	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The summary of the report was released at the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
16675	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The bitter dispute surrounding the report's release suggests the depth of anger that remains, nearly six years after the fact, over where blame should be assigned for the intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
16676	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Among the lawmakers who voiced renewed anger at the CIA's decision not to discipline anyone was Rep. Rush D. Holt, D-N.J., a member of the House intelligence committee.
16677	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"Accountability is a concept the American people understand," Holt said in a statement, adding: "I am stunned that Gen. Hayden still does not get that message."
16678	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Many of the report's findings about bureaucratic breakdowns that allowed the 19 hijackers to elude authorities and carry out the attacks have been documented elsewhere, principally by the Sept. 11 Commission, but the report by John Helgerson, the CIA inspector, was the first to recommend that top CIA officials face a disciplinary review.
16679	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The full report by the inspector general, totaling several hundred pages, remains classified.
16680	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As spelled out in the executive summary that was released on Tuesday, the report found neither "a single point of failure" nor a "silver bullet" that would have allowed the CIA to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks.
16681	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of their errors amount to misconduct.
16682	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
16683	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It cited "failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow through with operations and to properly share and analyze critical data."
16684	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report does not cite the names of the officials who it says "did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner," but it identifies some of them by their titles.
16685	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Besides Tenet, the probe criticizes James L. Pavitt, the CIA's former deputy director for operations
16686	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	J. Cofer Black, the former director of the agency's Counterterrorist Center
16687	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	and other top CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
16688	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
16689	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
16690	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report cited the CIA's failure to pass intelligence about al- Mihdhar and al-Hamzi to other agencies as potentially significant.
16691	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The CIA had identified the two men in January 2000 when they visited Malaysia, but never notified the State Department to put them on the terrorist watch list.
16692	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general report said some 50 to 60 CIA officials knew of the intelligence about the two men, a higher number than had been previously reported, and that persistent surveillance of them "had the potential to yield information on flight training, financing and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11 attacks.
16693	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure, and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida.
16694	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before Sept. 11, 2001.
16695	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"Without such an effort, we would not have been able to give the president a plan on Sept. 15, 2001, that led to the routing of the Taliban, chasing al-Qaida from its Afghan sanctuary and combating terrorists across 92 countries," Tenet said in the statement.
16696	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden.
16697	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said the standoff had prevented CIA officials from gaining access to transcripts of intercepted communications between terrorism suspects, and criticized Tenet for not interceding to resolve these turf battles.
16698	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In describing the period prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, the report said the CIA had carried out "no comprehensive analysis that put into context the threats received in the spring and summer of 2001."
16699	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
16700	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
16701	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a note to agency employees on Tuesday, Hayden made it clear that he continued to oppose the report's release.
16702	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed," he said.
16703	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But Philip Zelikow, the executive director of the Sept. 11 commission, praised the CIA report and said that it was broadly consistent with the findings of his panel.
16704	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"I was impressed at how brutal and unforgiving they were on their own senior management, which I thought spoke very well of the institution," Zelikow said.
16705	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Both Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.
16706	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.
16707	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NO CHECKS FOR BOMBS IN CERTIFIED AIR CARGO
16708	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
16709	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, President Bush signed a bill into law that requires some type of inspection of all freight carried on passenger planes.
16710	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
16711	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in getting the legislation blocked.
16712	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But in late July, Democrats passed the measure.
16713	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The new law was celebrated as a victory by pilot and flight attendant unions, as well as its main congressional champion, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Malden.
16714	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey put a video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website, proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger planes."
16715	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given three years under the law to develop a full inspection program, says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
16716	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	TSA spokesman Christopher White said freight "is inherently screened" if it is packed with tamper-evident seals at a facility that meets federal security standards.
16717	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by hand, just like bags checked by passengers.
16718	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	They said the Bush administration's decision to implement the new law with a "certified shippers" program is only a slight improvement over the current system, which allows cargo from "known shippers" to be loaded directly onto passenger planes.
16719	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The only difference is that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not have to meet security standards.
16720	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"As usual, the TSA is working to circumvent what we want and what we feel is the best type of security," said Captain Paul Onorato, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.
16721	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines up on the deck where they run it through.
16722	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	That's what we want" for cargo.
16723	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the TSA's procedures are finalized.
16724	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the early signs, he said, show that "it will be necessary to very closely monitor how this law is implemented."
16725	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline industry would even think that they could get away with anything less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto passenger planes," Markey said.
16726	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.
16727	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press conferences, and issued 17 news releases.
16728	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He is known for using props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline cargo.
16729	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the passenger airline industry had stoutly resisted any such requirement, saying it would cause delays that could jeopardize $4.3 billion per year in cargo business for air carriers.
16730	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry has also long insisted that machines do not exist that can screen certain densely-packed cargo boxes.
16731	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
16732	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The company that makes the machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without unpacking them.
16733	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to enact a law requiring such screening.
16734	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Immediately after Democrats won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill passed.
16735	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"If you have 100 percent physical inspection of cargo, you are basically going to shut that part of the economy down," said Jim May, president of the Air Transport Association, days after the election.
16736	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed Markey's proposal as part of the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act, which Bush signed Aug. 3.
16737	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags" within three years.
16738	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Many supporters of the bill assumed that meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either X-rayed or physically inspected.
16739	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute says the TSA must require more than a simple check of a shipment's paperwork against a database of registered shippers.
16740	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The law requires that if such data checks are used, they must be paired with a physical check or screening method approved by the TSA.
16741	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute does not require the screening to be performed on the airport premises or specify any screening method, but lists several examples of methods that would suffice, including X-ray machines, explosive detection systems, bomb-sniffing dogs, and a physical search.
16742	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But White, the TSA spokesman, said the agency believes the law will be satisfied merely if cargo comes from a "certified" facility, one that meets certain security standards.
16743	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He said the agency is also considering whether to require tamper-evident seals on cargo shipments.
16744	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Together, such precautions would be good enough, he said.
16745	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline industry, declined to comment on the new screening law.
16746	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
16747	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
16748	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
16749	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Shane Larson, the government affairs director for the Association of Flight Attendants, said it sounded as if the TSA and the airline carriers had agreed to interpret the law in a way that would allow for minimal changes, contrary to "what we believe is the intent of the law."
16750	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey said he is willing to give the TSA a chance to demonstrate that a "pack and seal approach" could really achieve the same level of security screening for bombs that checked luggage receives at airports, but expressed doubts.
16751	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	If Congress decides that the final regulations for freight security are not truly "commensurate" with the level of security that checked bags receive, Markey said, he and other lawmakers will seek to change them.
16752	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.
16753	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"If the Bush administration tries to bend the law, it is going to discover that there is a new sheriff in town."

16755	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Roger Federer is not lonely at No. 1.
16756	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He has plenty of company off the court.
16757	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	New York has been the site of Federer's three consecutive U.S. Open triumphs, and the two-week event has also given Federer a platform to meet and befriend luminaries.
16758	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Anna Wintour and Tiger Woods are now only a phone call away.
16759	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour, the editor of Vogue, was even closer Thursday night.
16760	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour threw Federer a dinner party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and invited 60 guests, including the designers Diane von Furstenberg, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta.
16761	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"That was great fun," Federer said Friday in a public garden atop Niketown, before speaking to children from the City Parks tennis program.
16762	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer first met Wintour at a charity event in New York.
16763	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Thursday's dinner, in honor of his recent appearance on the cover of Men's Vogue, had been postponed since March when Wintour told him to rest for the French Open.
16764	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I know Anna very well," Federer said.
16765	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"And then meeting the designers -- these people are a big inspiration.
16766	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	I've gotten into fashion the last few years, done my own fashion statements on center court at Wimbledon."
16767	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer wore a white blazer with the "RF" crest at Wimbledon, where he has won five straight titles.
16768	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Anna said that was fantastic," Federer said, grinning.
16769	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I think she's also excited about this outfit at the Open."
16770	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wearing different styles for day and night matches, Federer is seeking to become the first man in the open era to win four straight U.S. Open titles.
16771	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Lendl and John McEnroe also won three in a row.
16772	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	In July, Federer tied Bjorn Borg's record of five straight Wimbledon titles.
16773	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It would be nice to win four in a row, but basically I'm here to defend my title for last year," Federer said.
16774	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Wimbledon was great because it was five in a row.
16775	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	That was for me a really big streak."
16776	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	The victory at Wimbledon gave him his 11th major title.
16777	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	A month later, Woods won his 13th major title, at the PGA Championship, stoking their friendly competition to catch their sports' career leaders (Pete Sampras's 14 major titles and Jack Nicklaus's 18).
16778	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Last September, Woods was in Federer's box to watch him win the U.S. Open final against Andy Roddick.
16779	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Only afterward did Woods and Federer meet for the first time.
16780	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I had met many sports greats, but Tiger was a logical thing because we were always talking about each other," Federer said.
16781	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Now they frequently talk or text-message each other.
16782	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	(Federer said he did not think that Woods, a new father, would be coming to the Open this year.)
16783	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	They have seen each other play when their tournament schedules overlap, in Shanghai, Miami and Dubai, where their Gillette advertising campaign was announced in February.
16784	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Watching Woods play made him feel even more of a kinship.
16785	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"He does things a little bit similar to me," Federer said.
16786	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Like on the golf course, you think he's serious, so focused, concentrated guy.
16787	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	But then you get little hints of actually what personality he has off the golf course.
16788	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	When he gets a bit angry or laughs or does a joke with other golfers.
16789	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Off the court, he's so laid back, it's unbelievable."
16790	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer, 26, from Basel, Switzerland, is also laid-back.
16791	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He travels with a small entourage led by his longtime girlfriend, Mirka Vavrinec, who arranges his schedule in minute detail leading up to the Open.
16792	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Even though he has had daily practices since arriving Tuesday, Federer said he was grateful for some down time in New York after a grueling last few weeks in North America.
16793	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer lost in a final for only the third time this season, in Montreal against 20 -year-old Novak Djokovic of Serbia, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 7-6 (2).
16794	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer's only other losses in finals came on clay against Rafael Nadal: at Monte Carlo and at the French Open, the one major Federer has not won.
16795	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer avenged that loss at Wimbledon in a five-set thriller.
16796	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It's good sometimes to lose," said Federer, who followed the loss in Montreal by defeating James Blake for the title in Cincinnati last week.
16797	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"You start new.
16798	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Like last week, people talk, people think.
16799	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	One week later, you've won and everything is OK again.
16800	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	There was nothing to be worried about."
16801	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He has been No. 1 alone for 186 consecutive weeks.

16804	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The famous shipyard here, where the world-changing events of the Solidarity movement played out, is once again the subject of a standoff, this time between the Polish government and the European Union.
16805	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The Gdansk shipyard could go bankrupt if it is forced to pay back millions in disputed state subsidies deemed illegal by European officials.
16806	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	But the most surprising thing may be that there has been little popular outcry over the threat to the famous port.
16807	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The nation is transfixed by the sudden collapse of its government and preoccupied with the departure of an estimated one million workers, most of them young, for jobs in Western Europe.
16808	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The troubles at the shipyard, and the reaction to it, reveal the larger contradictions in the Polish economy and society, where there is a widening gulf between those in modern businesses and those who are left behind, anchored in older industries like shipbuilding.
16809	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	Right now, the Gdansk shipyard still hums with activity.

16815	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	He said he was making 400 euros, or $544, a month, about a quarter of what he could make in Western European shipyards.

16826	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif.
16827	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	A military hearing for a Marine squad leader accused of killing 17 Iraqi men, women and children in Haditha in 2005 ended abruptly on Thursday, after only three days of testimony that seemed to provoke more questions than answers.
16828	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Lawyers for the defendant, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, had been expected to call a fellow infantryman, who testified last week against Wuterich, back to the stand.
16829	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	That witness, Lance Cpl. Sanick Dela Cruz, had told the court that Wuterich killed five unarmed Iraqi men who got out of a car near the scene of a roadside bomb attack against the marines.
16830	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	After a three-hour delay, however, the defense dropped its plan to cross-examine Dela Cruz and the hearing ended.
16831	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Dela Cruz, who received immunity in April after prosecutors dropped murder charges against him in exchange for his testimony, had testified that Wuterich fired his M-16 rifle at the five men as they stood near the car, some with their hands raised in surrender.
16832	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	The defense had been expected to challenge that view.
16833	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich has admitted to shooting the men but said they began running away, defying orders to halt.
16834	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	His lawyers argued that running away in the moments after the bomb detonated could be construed as a hostile act under the Marine Corps rules of engagement in Iraq, where such attacks have posed the most frequent and deadliest threat to U.S. troops.
16835	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	But Wuterich's lawyers have not been able to prove that the men were running away
16836	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	on the contrary, testimony from a government forensic expert said the men's wounds suggested that they were not moving away when they were shot.
16837	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich, 27, of Meriden, Conn., is also charged with killing 12 other Iraqis, including seven women and children, in two homes after a Marine officer, 1st Lt. William T. Kallop, ordered the unit to clear an area south of the scene of the bomb.
16838	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Kallop was also granted immunity in return for his testimony.
16839	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's hearing is the last involving the four men initially charged with murder after the attack.
16840	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Murder charges against one of two enlisted men were dismissed in July.
16841	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Last month, Lt. Col. Paul J. Ware, who has presided over the hearings for all three enlisted men in the Haditha case, recommended dismissing all charges against the other enlisted man, but no decision has been made.
16842	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Those two men -- Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum -- were charged with killing nine people.
16843	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	As a more senior marine, Wuterich has been portrayed by prosecutors as responsible for not only his own actions but also those of his men.
16844	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Before the proceeding closed, Wuterich read a nine-page statement to Ware, who will advise a Marine general whether sufficient evidence exists to forward the charges to a court-martial.
16845	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	In the statement, Wuterich took responsibility for his decisions in the heat of battle to kill people in the two houses who he said were suspected of being armed insurgents, and for the order he gave to his men to "shoot first, ask questions later."
16846	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	"I wanted them to understand," he said, repeating a central argument of his defense, "that hesitation to shoot would only result in the four of us being killed."

16852	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He probably gets better medical treatment than most of us," Sean O'Keefe, LSU's chancellor, said.
16853	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He's one charmed cat."
16854	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That is a widely held view here, where football and a live tiger are seen as essential to the character of the state's flagship university.
16855	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
16856	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
16857	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Perhaps never before have animals been so prominent on the sports landscape.
16858	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age 17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger.
16859	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.
16860	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting.
16861	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court effectively prohibited the sale of soccer shoes made from kangaroo hides.
16862	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with synthetic materials for its basketballs.
16863	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and the national outrage aimed at the NFL quarterback Michael Vick after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.
16864	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"These are manifestations of increasing concern about well-being and the ethic that if you are going to use animals, there should be a compelling reason," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.
16865	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Referring to cockfighting and dogfighting, he said: "The idea that cruelty to animals is wrong has become a bedrock principle in American culture."
16866	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Twenty-five or 30 years ago, the news media and law enforcement officials might have looked the other way at an athlete involved in dogfighting, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor of sports sociology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
16867	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off and given him chance to cover up his tracks," Coakley said.
16868	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 1992, Jackie Sherrill, then the football coach at Mississippi State, got off with an apology and a warning after he had a bull castrated to motivate his players for a game against Texas, whose mascot is a longhorn steer named Bevo.
16869	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public attitudes appear to have changed since then.
16870	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Louisiana state Sen. Arthur J. Lentini of Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, led the effort in Louisiana to ban cockfighting, in which roosters are fitted with spikes for slashing duels.
16871	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
16872	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."
16873	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The ban takes effect in August 2008.
16874	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a campaign by animal-rights groups.
16875	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.
16876	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Response to the court decision has been mixed.
16877	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	While animal- rights groups celebrated, officials in Australia protested, saying that kangaroos are no longer endangered and need to be culled for proper conservation.
16878	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	A bill that would permit products made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California Legislature.
16879	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Consumers should not be intimidated by the scare tactics of extremists who have a long-term agenda of banning the use of non- endangered animal products," Warren Truss, Australia's trade minister, said in a statement after the court ruling.
16880	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
16881	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Vick, who has been suspended by the NFL and faces a possible prison sentence, has been widely criticized.
16882	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Yet some observers say that Vick has been subjected to greater outrage and punishment than players who have committed violence against people in shootings, incidents of domestic violence or fatal traffic accidents.
16883	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The LSU case represents perhaps PETA's most visible attempt to dissuade universities from using live mascots.
16884	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU has kept live tigers since 1936.
16885	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	About three dozen schools keep live mascots.
16886	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too costly for appropriate care.
16887	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans.
16888	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The arrangement ended in 1972 when the university, which lacks a veterinary school on campus, realized it could not provide suitable care, Christina Chapple, a Southeastern spokeswoman, said.
16889	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Everybody was excited, then the reality of keeping a live animal on campus set in," Chapple said.
16890	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"We weren't set up to handle that."
16891	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates.
16892	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.
16893	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Keeping wild animals in captivity is cruel," Lisa Wathne, a PETA captive exotic animal specialist, said in an interview.
16894	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"As grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger.
16895	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
16896	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots.
16897	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded habitat.
16898	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That same year, the University of South Carolina ignored PETA's request that it stop using Gamecocks as a nickname, given that cockfighting is illegal in the state.
16899	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Cockfighting is "certainly not condoned by the university," Russ McKinney, a South Carolina spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
16900	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.
16901	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In LSU's written response to PETA, O'Keefe, the chancellor, said that instead of being cruel and inhumane, the school's habitat was "far better" than most found in zoos.
16902	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	(At the Indiana rescue facility, Mike VI shared with four other tigers a 20-foot-by
16903	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	foot outdoor concrete enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G. Baker, the LSU veterinarian who is the tiger's caretaker, said in an interview.)
16904	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	O'Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to preserve the exotic cats "will need to be conducted in captivity."
16905	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The campus enclosure will allow Mike VI to roam, O'Keefe said, while keeping the animal safe from injury, poachers and infection.
16906	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU also plans to build an education center to inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.
16907	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least LSU's initial two home games, Baker said.
16908	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	First, it will attend soccer games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds.
16909	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said.
16910	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And no one will be allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt to make it roar, he said.
16911	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field.
16912	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.
16913	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Referring to PETA officials, Baker said, "According to them, humans don't have the moral authority to eat, own, exhibit or experiment upon animals.
16914	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	I don't share that religion."
16915	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	A RUSH TO CASH OUT OF NORTHERN ROCK
16916	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	LONDON
16917	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Terry Mays and his wife, both British retirees, decided during the weekend that a promise by the Bank of England to provide emergency financing for Northern Rock, the troubled British mortgage lender that has most of their savings, was not sufficient to calm their nerves.
16918	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The couple joined hundreds of other Northern Rock customers Monday as lines formed for a third day in front of branches where people waited to withdraw their savings.
16919	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the bank will collapse -- but we just don't have the nerves," he said, surrounded by a group of depositors who had traveled with him to the central London branch from a southern one after being told that the wait there would be at least six hours.
16920	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"I took some financial advice over the weekend, and I'm taking the money out to get peace of mind.
16921	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	We're relying on this money for our pension."
16922	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Panicky customers have withdrawn an estimated 2 billion pounds, or $4 billion, since the bank acknowledged Friday that it no longer could raise funds because of the credit crunch that has squeezed global markets following a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States.
16923	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Unlike other banks that have been bailed out because of direct exposure to subprime mortgages, Northern Rock was the first to directly fall victim to the global credit squeeze, because it relied heavily on raising funds in the capital markets.
16924	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Shares in Northern Rock slumped 33 percent Monday to a seven-year low, dragging European banking stocks lower across the board as jittery investors began scrutinizing banks to determine which ones might have a similar business model.

16940	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The specter of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also sparked a raft of questions about whether the robust British economy -- supported in large part by a heated housing market --" would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
16941	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The pound fell below $2 for the first time in nearly three weeks.
16942	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British economic growth.
16943	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Members of Britain's opposition Conservative party Monday blamed Prime Minister Gordon Brown for ignoring warnings of a "looming debt crisis" for the past four years and for encouraging consumers to take on record debt when he was chancellor of the Exchequer during this period.
16944	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	In recent years, British mortgage lenders began offering loans exceeding the value of the properties on which they were based.
16945	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices and fueled speculation in the real estate market.
16946	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only days after refusing to inject liquidity into cash-starved financial markets on the basis that such action encouraged "excessive risk-taking."
16947	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	So far, assurances from the Northern Rock chief executive, Adam Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of England, have failed to impress depositors.
16948	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	In a bid to shore up confidence, Darling announced Monday that the government would guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other troubled financial institution that approached the government.
16949	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	No other bank or institution had yet approached the Bank of England, he added.
16950	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some of those waiting in line to retrieve their savings Monday blamed what they called lax standards at both U.S. and British mortgage lenders for the shortage of funds at Northern Rock.
16951	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"We had to go through a lengthy process to get a mortgage that was barely more than we earned, and now my son's girlfriend can get double that with hardly any income," said one customer, who declined to give his name but said he planned to withdraw his entire savings of more than 100,000 pounds.
16952	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"That's just not right."
16953	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Northern Rock opened at 8 a.m. Monday, one hour earlier than usual, to deal with the expected wave of withdrawals.
16954	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	It had to increase the bandwidth on its Web site, which had struggled with the volume of people trying to access it.
16955	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw her money after watching the morning news and seeing new lines forming at the bank branches.
16956	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"I hate to take out the money, but I just don't want to risk anything," she said, adding that she did not yet know what she would do with it.
16957	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Troubles at Northern Rock filled the top headlines in the British press, further spreading nervousness.
16958	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The BBC wrote on its Web site that clients were besieging branches, while The Evening Standard said that savers had pushed the bank to the "brink of extinction."
16959	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"People are mortified and if savers are continuing to withdraw funds, a sale or split up becomes more likely," said Christine Ross, head of financial planning at SG Hambros in London.
16960	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Large clearing banks like Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland might profit by scooping up former Northern Rock customers, she said.
16961	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Jonathan Pierce, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse in London, said that the most likely scenario for Northern Rock was a sale to another bank either "as a business or division of assets."
16962	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Yet, the difficulties have "severely dented" the brand, he said.
16963	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some customers, including Mays, wished they had the nerves to keep some savings with Northern Rock and wait for the bank to be bought.
16964	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"There was speculation that whoever buys it could offer incentives for customers to leave their money in there," Mays said.
16965	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"But the thing is, you just don't know."

16967	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A woman in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when she submitted her time sheet.
16968	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	She had worked 800 hours of overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or 13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
16969	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living.
16970	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Bird had logged so many hours.
16971	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And the labor lawyers?
16972	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her overtime pay.
16973	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about it anymore.
16974	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
16975	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says that unless you are an "exempt worker" you must be paid time and a half after a 40-hour workweek.
16976	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
16977	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Usually "exempt" is a relief, as in "exempt" from jury duty.
16978	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law.
16979	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets paid.
16980	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
16981	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services, professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low- level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.
16982	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In 2003, the Bush administration set out to "clarify" the law, revising income-level tests in various job categories (above them, you are a salaried manager and don't get overtime
16983	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	below them, you are not a manager and you do) and specifying that more than half a manager's time actually has to be spent managing.
16984	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
16985	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"All that's clear is that it clearly didn't work," said Robert Fox, the deputy director of Working America, founded four years ago by the AFL-CIO to address the needs of working families who do not belong to unions.
16986	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The most common question posted on the "Ask a Lawyer" section of the group's Web site, Fox said, is about overtime: "Who's eligible?
16987	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Who's exempt?
16988	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
16989	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Let's take those one at a time.
16990	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The "who's eligible, who's exempt?"
16991	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
16992	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
16993	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
16994	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at lunch.
16995	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk.
16996	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
16997	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
16998	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Or an e-mail message from a client?
16999	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And you respond?
17000	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Are you working again?
17001	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"That counts as working time," said Mark Thierman, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Reno, Nev., "particularly if you don't feel you can turn around and say 'I'm on my lunch break and I'll get to it later.'
17002	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
17003	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone when you are technically off the clock?
17004	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"BlackBerry time is work time," said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices group of Fenwick &amp
17005	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
17006	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	West, a law firm.
17007	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It absolutely counts."
17008	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
17009	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule.
17010	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And while the people most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too.
17011	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time."
17012	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if so many of us qualify for overtime, and there are so many opportunities for overtime, why aren't more of us getting more extra pay?
17013	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
17014	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
17015	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Of course, there are electronic records of work calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.
17016	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It is daunting to keep an accurate record," said John Thompson, a partner in the Atlanta office of Fisher &amp
17017	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
17018	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Phillips, a labor and employment firm.
17019	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"In a wireless world, nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
17020	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Put another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when they are working from when they are not.
17021	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
17022	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens.
17023	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
17024	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
17025	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Plaintiffs' lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that workers wrongly classified as "exempt" are reluctant to change their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.
17026	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Thierman, the lawyer from Reno, tells of a suit he brought and won against a brokerage firm, proving that employees were entitled to overtime.
17027	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The company paid a substantial settlement, "then went back to doing things the old way," he said.
17028	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?"'
17029	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Thierman recalled.
17030	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	He said the opponent answered, "They don't think they can go onto college campuses and tell people 'We pay hourly."'
17031	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	WRONGED MAN ON A MISSION GIVES SPARK TO ' LIFE '
17032	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	British actor Damian Lewis is a natural lead as an oddball American in NBC's "Life," which premieres Wednesday night.
17033	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.
17034	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Now back on the force, extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
17035	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis turns Crews into an amusing figure - almost as comic as Tony Shalhoub's Monk, as he pronounces Zen platitudes to no one in particular and constantly munches on fruit.
17036	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	In between bites of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he hates cops.
17037	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is helpless when it comes to all the technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
17038	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations, Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top of a gusher of emotion.
17039	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The guy spent more than a decade in prison among inmates who don't exactly take kindly to cops
17040	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	we can tell that his lightheartedness is but a thin veneer.
17041	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And when he's interrogating suspects, his fury clearly rears its head.
17042	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Is Charlie about to go off the deep end?
17043	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis, with his red hair, pale face, and nonchalant expression, is compelling as he toys with Charlie's balance.
17044	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The actor, who uses a flawless American accent, makes "Life" worth a gander.
17045	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is surrounded by a distinctive cast.
17046	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Sarah Shahi, from "The L Word" and the "Sopranos" episode in which Tony ate magic mushrooms, is likable as Charlie's untrusting new partner.
17047	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Robin Weigart, who was Calamity Jane on "Deadwood," exudes a strong but ambiguous presence as the lieutenant.
17048	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And Adam Arkin is sweet as Charlie's former cellmate who now lives above the garage at Charlie's mansion.
17049	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in 1994, is promising.
17050	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	While each episode will focus on a particular criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually.
17051	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	After one episode, I was already curious about what landed Charlie in jail.
17052	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The premiere is presented partly as a documentary about Charlie, on the occasion of his release from jail, and clearly some of those featured in the reel were responsible for his incarceration.
17053	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not long for the world?
17054	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	For one thing, as good as Lewis is, Charlie may be too strange for mainstream consumption.
17055	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He's a hard character to understand, although I am certain that, ultimately, he is understandable.
17056	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first place.
17057	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or "the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.
17058	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Up against "CSI: NY" and "Dirty Sexy Money," the lifespan of "Life" will likely be short.

17060	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
17061	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
17062	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
17063	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Lloyd Shugart, sole proprietor of Studio 413 in Sodo, won the federal court victory against Prop?t late last month.
17064	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t has asked U.S. District Magistrate Judge Mary Alice Theiler to reject or reduce the jury verdict in Shugart's favor, and that request is set to be argued Thursday, said Philip Mann, a Seattle attorney representing Shugart.
17065	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
17066	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"I do feel vindicated," he added.
17067	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"It restored my faith in the legal system.
17068	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The jury paid close attention."
17069	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the big guy.
17070	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	It's one of these things where the system works for a change."
17071	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing.
17072	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
17073	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
17074	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit, Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay for $1.3 million.
17075	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
17076	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000 for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
17077	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights to them.
17078	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
17079	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
17080	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann and Shugart couldn't account for the fact that the total value of the jury award equaled the amount Shugart had planned to seek for the images on eBay.
17081	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence or not, I don't know," Mann said.
17082	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case, "so far as we know," is the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Mann said.
17083	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
17084	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
17085	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image, but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered.
17086	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
17087	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"The axiom that the copyright is created when the image is created means nothing."

17108	NYT_ENG_20071013.0017.LDC2009T13	Graham's new rushing role will affect another unit.
17109	NYT_ENG_20071013.0017.LDC2009T13	"As his role changes, his role and involvement on special teams has to change," Gruden said.
17110	NYT_ENG_20071013.0017.LDC2009T13	"We need someone to pick up the slack there."

17117	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	CONCORD, N.C.
17118	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Jeff Gordon has little to prove in a career that has left him among the best drivers to have ever competed in NASCAR.
17119	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has four Cup championships, and his legacy is already secure.
17120	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That does not stop him from pushing for more.
17121	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing that says I need to do this or I need to do that, or I haven't done this and so this is what's left," Gordon said Thursday as he prepared for the Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
17122	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm just trying to be competitive and continue to get that great feeling of what it's like to win races and battle for championships and hope that we've got what it takes to do it."
17123	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	So far, he still does.
17124	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon survived a shocking end to Saturday's race, losing the lead as his car sputtered, only to hang on after the leader Ryan Newman crashed with three laps to go in regulation.
17125	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish, Gordon then held off Clint Bowyer to take the checkered flag for his second consecutive victory.
17126	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He also took control of the playoff chase.
17127	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has a 68-point lead on his teammate Jimmie Johnson, who finished 14th, and a 78-point on Bowyer, who finished second as he continues to assert himself in the playoff.
17128	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	With five races to go in the Chase, they are the only three drivers with a realistic shot at winning the title.
17129	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon came into the race in a slump at Lowe's, having failed to finish each of his last five races here dating back to 2005.
17130	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, Johnson came into the race with five victories at Lowe's and an air of invincibility here.
17131	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Johnson experienced a rare spin-out with 104 laps to go and fell to 30th, before climbing back.
17132	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"This is what we were looking for, getting a win at Charlotte," Gordon said as he celebrated in victory lane.
17133	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the final laps, Gordon had a comfortable lead on Kyle Busch, his Hendrick Motorsports teammate when the race was red-flagged for a little more than 12 minutes after a late crash left oil on the track.
17134	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
17135	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But he was instructed by the team owner, Rick Hendrick, not to wreck Gordon, and Busch agreed.
17136	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
17137	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the playoff chase into a one-man race.
17138	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He dominated through the first 200 laps of the event.
17139	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But a long stay on pit road to replace a part dropped him down to 16th place with just over 120 laps to go.
17140	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson appeared on his way up the field when he spun out.
17141	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.
17142	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who won his first title last year, can become the first driver since Gordon to win back-to-back championships in the Cup series since Gordon pulled off that feat in 1997-98.
17143	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	It appears the two-time champion Tony Stewart will not be a threat.
17144	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of the race.
17145	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Stewart's No. 20 Chevrolet sustained damage on the right front and he dropped back to 28th.
17146	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Although Stewart finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.
17147	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	BROWNS ' ANDERSON CONTINUES TO AMAZE
17148	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17149	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	BEREA, Ohio -- Five weeks ago, the Cleveland Browns had three quarterbacks, but they really didn't have any.
17150	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Now, they have what could be their quarterback of the future and, amazingly enough, it's not necessarily Brady Quinn.
17151	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	The Browns are averaging 32 points per game in the five games quarterback Derek Anderson has started.
17152	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	They are 3-2 in those games and 3-3 overall heading into their bye week.
17153	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	What to make of Anderson?
17154	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a guy on a roll?
17155	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	The next Tom Brady?
17156	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Something in between?
17157	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Anderson can be a restricted free agent at the end of the season, so the Browns will use the rest of the season to get a handle on what they actually have.
17158	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"He's going to continue to get better," tight end Steve Heiden said Monday.
17159	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"That's the exciting part."
17160	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Anderson threw three touchdown passes to Braylon Edwards in Sunday's 41-31 victory over the winless Miami Dolphins.
17161	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	He also scored a touchdown and made none of the mistakes that tended to cast doubt upon him in the preseason, causing the Browns to open the season with the since-traded Charlie Frye under center.
17162	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"You go week to week," head coach Romeo Crennel said.
17163	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's too early to say he's Tom Brady or Tom Brady-like or anything like that.
17164	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	He's gotten an opportunity, and he's running with it.
17165	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	I knew he was capable.
17166	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	It's not really surprising."
17167	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	And the other candidate for 'quarterback of the future' can do nothing but watch.
17168	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's easier when (Anderson's) playing like that," Quinn said.
17169	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"I'm a team player."

17172	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	MIDEAST HAWKS HELP TO DEVELOP GIULIANI POLICY
17173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
17174	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
17175	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
17176	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
17177	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Daniel Pipes, the director of the Middle East Forum, who has called for profiling Muslims at airports and scrutinizing American Muslims in law enforcement, the military and the diplomatic corps
17178	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	and Michael Rubin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written in favor of revoking the U.S. ban on assassination.
17179	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
17180	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative thinking in some respects.
17181	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
17182	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the next president will confront and is still meeting for the first time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on particular subjects.
17183	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani has taken an aggressive position on Iran's efforts to build a nuclear program, saying last month it was a "promise" that as president he would take military action to keep the Iranians from developing a nuclear weapon.
17184	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among some Democrats.
17185	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Podhoretz said in an interview published Wednesday in the New York Observer that he recently met with Giuliani to discuss his new book, in which he advocates bombing Iran as part of a larger struggle against "Islamofascism," and "there is very little difference in how he sees the war and I see it."
17186	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Democratic candidate for president and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said recently that the specter of a Giuliani presidency frightened him.
17187	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said in a recent interview.
17188	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
17189	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
17190	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Yes.
17191	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
17192	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
17193	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Like the neoconservatives, who played a major role in developing the Bush administration's rationale for invading Iraq, Giuliani is a strong supporter of Israel who has expressed skepticism about how far the United States should go to back the creation of a Palestinian state.
17194	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
17195	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani rejects the democracy effort as premature and overly idealistic, noting that the policy led to the sweeping victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections.
17196	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Elections are necessary but not sufficient to establish genuine democracy," Giuliani wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs, the policy journal.
17197	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their neighbors."
17198	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
17199	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I would say, as a card-carrying member of the neoconservative conspiracy, that I think Giuliani, McCain and Thompson are all getting really good advice -- and Romney," said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard.
17200	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign policy."
17201	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings, contains a number of main elements.
17202	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
17203	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
17204	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to emphasize trade over aid.
17205	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
17206	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Weakness invites attack," Giuliani warned to cheers in a speech he gave recently to the Republican Jewish Coalition.
17207	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with unfriendly countries.
17208	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
17209	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In a recent speech to the Jewish Coalition, he went further, accusing the Democrats of putting too much stock in diplomacy.
17210	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he said.
17211	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"You've got to know with whom to negotiate and with whom you should not negotiate."
17212	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
17213	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Aides to Giuliani dismiss any comparison to the briefings Bush received when he was the governor of Texas, and a procession of experts -- who called themselves Vulcans, after the Greek god of the forge -- visited him in Austin to school him on policy.
17214	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.
17215	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	One of Giuliani's most important foreign policy tutors is Charles Hill, a career diplomat and former deputy to Secretary of State George P. Shultz in the Reagan administration.
17216	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
17217	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill went on to become the campaign's chief foreign policy adviser, and to assemble a team that is united by its generally hawkish views and its belief in using American power to achieve its aims.
17218	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hill joined a number of prominent foreign policy experts in signing an open letter to Bush urging that "even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack, any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
17219	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."
17220	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He sometimes faults Democrats for failing to mention that the terrorist threat comes specifically from Muslims.
17221	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	When Giuliani was asked in a recent interview if he could be viewed as an evenhanded broker when it came to Israeli- Palestinian issues, he questioned the premise of the question.
17222	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"America shouldn't be even-handed in dealing with the difference between an elected democracy that's a government ruled by law, and a group of terrorists," he said.
17223	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think that was part of the mistake of the 1990s that led to the debacle that we saw in the Middle East in the way Clinton was handling it."

17228	NYT_ENG_20071030.0276.LDC2009T13	The cause was cancer, diagnosed a week after Lipper and Anderson, known as Andy, were married on Sept. 1 at Central Presbyterian Church in Summit, said her father, A. Michael Lipper of Summit.

17242	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	EL SEGUNDO, Calif.
17243	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The expected return of Lamar Odom to the Lakers' starting lineup Friday will send one of his teammates to the bench, and the smart money seems to be on forward Luke Walton.
17244	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Barring any last-minute setbacks, Odom, who underwent shoulder surgery in May, will play Friday.
17245	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Last season, Odom partnered with Walton in the starting frontcourt, but that could change now.
17246	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I know, but you don't," coach Phil Jackson said after practice Wednesday afternoon.
17247	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	In response to separate questions, however, Jackson said Walton would "be really good to help that second team, too" and praised the effort of Ronny Turiaf, who has started each of the first four games.
17248	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"There's some things Ronny is doing that are very good," Jackson said.
17249	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"His energy is good.
17250	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Sustaining it is not easy for him.
17251	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It's a lot of work, and he's not in the kind of condition yet that he can sustain that, so it's great to have Lamar coming back, who can come in and play a couple different positions."
17252	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson did indicate that Odom would start, rather than ease his way back into the lineup as a reserve.
17253	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Walton, a reserve in his first three seasons, started all 60 games in which he appeared last season.
17254	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom, who led the Lakers in rebounding last season and was second in points and assists per game, went though his most physical practice to date and pronounced himself ready to return to game action.
17255	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom said he didn't fear that the shoulder would impact him physically and wasn't concerned that he would think about it while on the court.
17256	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I go all out," Odom said.
17257	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's how I play.
17258	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It's the college football mentality, right?
17259	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Just go out there.
17260	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	We're athletes, so we have to play in pain sometimes.
17261	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It took me some time to come back from this injury but I feel like I'm ready."
17262	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	WALKING WOUNDED: Kwame Brown (right-heel bursitis) and Maurice Evans (lower-back pain) did not practice.
17263	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Evans is unlikely to play Friday and Brown's status remains day to day, Jackson said.
17264	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Brown received electronic-stimulation treatment near the end of practice, then hobbled off the court.
17265	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	DECISION TIME FOR JACKSON: Still uncertain is whether Jackson will return beyond this season.
17266	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The Lakers have a standing contract extension on the table, and Jackson said he will make his decision soon.
17267	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"It will probably be before Thanksgiving, or around Thanksgiving time," Jackson said.
17268	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's a good time period."
17269	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson has maintained that health, along with the Lakers' chances of being a championship contender, will determine his future.
17270	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson periodically uses a cane to walk, five-plus months after his second hip-replacement surgery.
17271	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson said "things are going very positive for me" but said he wants to see how he feels after a longer road trip before he makes a decision.
17272	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I've yet to experience a two-game road trip, or something like that, to just know that I can get out of bed, get my clothes on and make it to breakfast in the morning," Jackson said.

17275	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Chinese authorities on Friday confirmed the deaths of about 30 more people from a landslide that struck this week in the Three Gorges Dam region.
17276	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The news comes as Chinese officials are facing growing questions about environmental and geological problems related to the dam project.
17277	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Initial reports from state news media on Wednesday stated that one construction worker died, another was injured and two more were trapped in a landslide on Tuesday at a railroad construction site in Badong County, upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.
17278	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But on Friday morning, Xinhua, the official news agency, released a short report saying that rescuers had discovered a passenger bus crushed beneath the rubble.
17279	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	It said "about 30 more people" were believed dead.
17280	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	"Rescuers said there were no signs of life on the bus," Xinhua reported.
17281	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The bus apparently left Shanghai on Monday.
17282	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	There has been no news about the two trapped workers.
17283	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	As yet, it is not certain what caused this particular landslide, but scientists and critics have been warning for years that the reservoir created by the Three Gorges Dam might further destabilize hillsides, causing landslides and possibly even earthquakes.
17284	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Officials countered that the design of the project accounted for such concerns.
17285	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	In recent weeks, Chinese officials have been trying to tamp down growing controversy about the impact that the dam is having on the environment and fragile geology in the surrounding region.
17286	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At a September forum about the dam, Chinese officials and experts discussed issues like water pollution, sedimentation and landslides and warned of a future environmental "catastrophe" if measures were not taken.
17287	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, a vice mayor from the city of Chongqing said the shoreline of the reservoir had collapsed in 91 places as water levels continued to slowly rise.
17288	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	A day after the forum, Xinhua released a short article disclosing the official concerns.
17289	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The article caused an immediate sensation, given that officials had rarely expressed misgivings about the signature project.
17290	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	This week, Chinese officials have been making a major public relations push to play down problems at the dam.
17291	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, ran a banner article across the front page beneath the headline: "Dam Impact 'Less Than Predicted.' "
17292	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Landslides had been a problem in the Three Gorges area before construction of the dam.
17293	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Dam officials say they have made improvements in stabilizing the region's geology in recent years and that landslides are not a major problem.
17294	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But peasants in many villages say the number of landslides have increased since the reservoir began filling up.
17295	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Several local officials have said that pressure from the rising water is a factor in many, if not all, the recent landslides.
17296	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Currently, water levels are at about 500 feet.
17297	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Planners intend to raise water levels to 575 feet by 2009.

17300	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	SOUTHFIELD -- After Metro Detroit Jewish families lit the first candle on their menorahs this week, many of the Hanukkah presents exchanged weren't dreidels and gelts.
17301	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Instead in many Jewish homes, gifts of video game systems, computers, toys and clothes pushed aside the traditional tokens of the holidays--the spinning dreidel tops used for centuries to teach tales of the Torah, the primary Jewish religious text, and the foil-wrapped gelts, chocolates shaped like coins,
17302	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	That shift has gotten the attention of the nation's retailers, as they look to Hanukkah as a way to expand the gift-giving market.

17318	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Hanukkah is an eight-evening long "Festival of Lights," marking the 165 B.C. victory of the Jewish Maccabee tribe over Syrian forces and the miracle of one day's supply of lamp oil lasting for eight full days, according to the Torah.
17319	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	It holds much less importance for Jews than Yom Kippur, the Jewish New Year, or Passover, which falls around Easter time.
17320	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, the holiday has gotten more attention, much of it from retailers vying for business from Jewish families.
17321	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Rebecca Miller, a 38-year-old mother of three elementary school- aged children in Bloomfield Hills, said the pressure to make Hanukkah more like Christmas is enormous.
17322	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"We've gone traditional in the past," said Miller, who is Jewish and married to a Catholic.
17323	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"But we're trying to integrate Hanukkah and Christmas together as they grow up, and I think this is our middle ground."

17327	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	While it's unclear exactly how the shift from religious to secular Hanukkah gift-giving has affected the retail market, economists from the National Retail Federation earlier this year predicted an increase in gift-buying by non-Christian families celebrating holidays other than Christmas would be important in the growth of this year's year-end sales.

17331	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"Hanukkah has taken a new dimension," Plotnik said.
17332	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"The gift- giving isn't religious anymore."
17333	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	So while families still buy replacement candles for menorahs or oil for traditional lamps for cooking, other old-school gifts have largely fallen out of style.
17334	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	As a compromise, Plotnik stocks toys and games with religious overtones, such as modern board games featuring Jewish themes, along with toys, books and videos that teach Jewish history, Hebrew or Yiddish.
17335	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	On Web retailer oytoys.com, plush Hanukkah toys and DVD sets like "Shalom Sesame," which features Sesame Street characters on a journey through Israel also are popular.

17364	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Even so, Vertex chief executive Joshua Boger, who earned his doctorate in chemistry at Harvard, said he hopes the project will help his company begin a "dialogue" with Harvard researchers working in areas that could be useful to Vertex's development efforts.
17365	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a total of several million dollars over three years.
17366	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	If Harvard decides to license any technology developed, Vertex said it has the option to license it first.
17367	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model," Boger said.
17368	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Fuchs said Biogen Idec hopes to house up to four or five companies in its biotech incubator within two years.
17369	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
17370	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone biology and metabolism.
17371	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The company hopes to pioneer new treatments for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity, which have been on the increase in the United States.
17372	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Fuchs said Biogen Idec plans to give each company in its incubator between $3 million and $10 million in seed funding over several years, dedicated office and laboratory space, administrative support, and technical expertise.
17373	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In return, Biogen Idec will receive stock in the companies and an option to eventually buy the rest at a prenegotiated price.
17374	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Two local venture capitalists were enthusiastic about Biogen Idec's endeavor.
17375	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"I'm a big fan of what they are doing," said Terry McGuire, managing general partner of Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham.
17376	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"There's always a shortage of capital for the early stage stuff."
17377	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Peter Feinstein, general partner of BioVentures Investors in Cambridge, said he thought Biogen Idec could help invigorate its research programs by bringing in entrepreneurs with new ideas.
17378	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It like having puppies around an older dog," Feinstein said.
17379	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Walts, however, said one concern with a corporate incubator is that it could hurt start-ups' ability to work with other drug companies.
17380	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	So, he said, Genzyme is considering setting up a "virtual incubator" instead.
17381	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Genzyme would provide seed funding and technical support to new ventures, but would not physically house the companies on its property.
17382	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	That way, the companies might be better able to forge their own identities.
17383	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Regardless, Walts said, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Vertex share a common goal: finding new ways to tap into early-stage drug research.
17384	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which approach works best.

17387	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	GLENDALE, Calif.
17388	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	She had sparkling blue eyes, a captivating smile and a strong will to live despite her struggle with leukemia.
17389	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Nataline Sarkisyan, the 17-year-old Northridge girl whose death last week sparked a renewed call for health-care reform after she was twice denied a prescribed liver transplant, was buried Friday after a tear-streaked funeral.
17390	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"Though she is no longer with us physically, she is now resting peacefully in the presence of God," said Archbishop Mousbegh Mardirossian, western prelate for the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, who presided over her funeral north of downtown Los Angeles.
17391	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"She is the foundation and hope for tomorrow."
17392	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Nataline died Thursday just hours after her insurance company, Philadelphia-based Cigna HealthCare, reversed two prior decisions to deny her a liver transplant despite the pleadings of doctors.
17393	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	The insurance company, which deemed the surgery experimental, stated it would pay for the procedure "in this rare and unusual case" after loud public protest.
17394	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Nataline's case drew national attention among health advocates and Armenian groups calling for reform.
17395	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"What happened here is a glaring example of what happens when you let the insurance companies decide who lives and who dies," said Geri Jenkins, co-president of the California Nurses Association, before she attended the funeral.
17396	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"We've put the insurance companies in the driver's seat -- and that needs to change."
17397	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"We're here because of an insurance failure, not being able to get a patient in time," added Berdj Kasbarian, president of the Hye Riders Motorcycle Club, among two dozen Armenian bikers attending the service.
17398	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"We should change the health-care system to a European system, where everybody is covered."
17399	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	More than 800 mourners in black packed the ornate St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church in Glendale to hail Nataline's zest for life.
17400	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	They wore ribbons of pink, her favorite color.
17401	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	And they wiped their eyes before the white and gold casket bearing the Granada Hills Charter High School student.
17402	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Priests waved chalices of incense as family members recalled the curly haired teen who'd contracted leukemia at age 14, seen it duck into remission, then strike again with a vengeance last summer.
17403	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	The day before Thanksgiving, her brother Bedig had donated his bone marrow.
17404	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	But because of her failing liver, doctors recommended a transplant.
17405	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	On Dec. 11, Cigna denied a liver transplant for the girl, despite the pleadings of physicians at UCLA Medical Center where she was treated.
17406	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	The Sarkisyan family has retained celebrity attorney Mark Geragos for an expected lawsuit.
17407	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"The last 3 1-2 years were extremely difficult, filled with doctors visits, hospitals and pain," said Jeanette Sabonjian, the girl's aunt. "
17408	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	(Yet) she had elegance, beauty and strength.
17409	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	She had wisdom and life and courage.
17410	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"She never forgot how to live."
17411	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Friends said they'd never seen Nataline without a smile.
17412	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Despite being forced to study at home, she loved high fashion and dance.
17413	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	On her bracelet, she'd worn a pair of ballet shoes.
17414	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	And despite her condition, she always found the time to bake cupcakes or dazzle diners with such dishes as artichokes with peas, infused with garlic and lemon.
17415	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Last year, she'd planned a Sweet 16 party for 300 guests, including a dipping fountain for chocolate strawberries.
17416	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"She was so big-hearted," said Raffi Ganoumian, her cousin.
17417	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"In the condition she was going through, she always put everybody first."
17418	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	But despite her charm, she bore a deep inner sadness, according to her statements written three years ago and published for the funeral.
17419	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"At this moment my life has changed," she writes.
17420	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	"No wonder I cry day after day, I am lonely without a friend, I feel locked up in a den, life is tragic I don't know why."
17421	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Outside, friends and family gathered beneath gray skies to proceed to her burial at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, followed by an Armenian meal in remembrance.

17424	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	HUCKABEE PULLS NEGATIVE AD AS CANDIDATES GET OUT FINAL IOWA MESSAGES
17425	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17426	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, reeling under a negative TV ad campaign from rival Mitt Romney, said Monday he made a last-minute decision to pull an anti-Romney ad he had shipped to Iowa stations.
17427	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
17428	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge gamble on my part.
17429	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
17430	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll probably be the last guy to ever do this."
17431	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said, appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads despite the fact that history indicates they work.
17432	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	As Huckabee and Romney sparred for the lead as the Thursday caucuses approach, a new poll showed a virtual three-way dead heat on the Democratic side, with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton maintaining a slight lead over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who has the momentum.
17433	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
17434	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.
17435	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A McClatchy/MSNBC poll conducted Dec. 3-6 showed Huckabee in first place, 12 points ahead of runner-up Romney.
17436	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	But last week, the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was second.
17437	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
17438	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign
17439	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	and on the other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
17440	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	And I think that's a very confusing and puzzling message," he said, referring to the news coverage that is sure to spread the Huckabee ad's message.
17441	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Madden branded Huckabee's decision to pull the ad but show it at a news conference as "a bizarre display of hypocrisy."
17442	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee told reporters he showed them the ad because if he didn't, "you'd say, 'Where's the ad?"
17443	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The ad was produced Sunday and shipped to Iowa stations to begin airing Monday.
17444	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.
17445	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"Iowans have a right to know the truth about Mitt Romney's dishonest attacks on me and an American hero, John McCain," Huckabee says on the ad.
17446	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"If a man's dishonest to obtain a job, he'll be dishonest on the job."
17447	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	University of Iowa political scientist Peverill Squire said Huckabee's move "suggests the campaign is a bit more amateur than its competition."
17448	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
17449	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	On the Democratic side, a Reuters-C-SPAN-Zogby poll released Monday and conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Clinton at 30 percent among likely caucus-goers
17450	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama and Edwards each were at 26 percent.
17451	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, making it a statistical three-way tie.
17452	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A previous poll last week had Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
17453	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Edwards is pushing a populist message that is finding a receptive audience in Iowa.
17454	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti- Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
17455	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton targeted Edwards during a stop in Keokuk, apparently mocking his animated attacks on special interests.
17456	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's not something you have to do by yelling and screaming.
17457	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Save your energy.
17458	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Get the job done," she said about battles in Washington.
17459	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"Instead of generating a lot of heat, rolling your hands and jumping up and down, sit down and figure out how we're going to beat them."
17460	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as first lady amounted to chatting over tea.
17461	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, she responded sharply to these jabs, noting that she was the first high-level American to go to Bosnia after the Dayton peace accords.
17462	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"We landed in one of those cork screw landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire - I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac," she said.
17463	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Last Friday, Obama suggested his global experience eclipses the eight years Clinton spent as first lady.
17464	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's that experience, that understanding, not just of what world leaders I went and talked to in the ambassador's house I had tea with, but understanding the lives of the people like my grandmother who lives in a tiny hut in Africa," he said.
17465	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout.
17466	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Marion County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus.
17467	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	My job is to be so persuasive that you conclude 'I've got to go for Obama.

17469	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	All three Democrats found themselves negatively depicted in a last-minute round of phone calls to likely caucus-goers in Iowa.
17470	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In each case, recipients told the Associated Press that a caller pretending to conduct a poll of candidate preferences began by asking who the caucus-goer intends to support.

17476	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Detroit News Washington Bureau
17477	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Rudy Giuliani's Michigan supporters say they're aiming for a top- three finish in Michigan's Republican presidential primary, a lowering of expectations for the one-time leader here that highlights Giuliani's high-risk strategy of bypassing the campaign's earliest contests.
17478	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Polls show the former New York mayor could finish fourth, or even lower, in today's New Hampshire primary, after a fifth-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.
17479	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	And with Mitt Romney and John McCain expected to begin intense campaign efforts in Michigan Wednesday, Giuliani will largely bypass the state, spending some time and money here but continuing to focus on Florida's Jan. 29 primary and the two-dozen states holding contests on Feb. 5.
17480	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"If we're in the top three, I'd feel very good about that," Giuliani's Michigan campaign chairwoman, Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Twp., said Monday.
17481	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a finish would do nothing, she said, to change Giuliani's strategy, which relies on competing in larger states with more convention delegates at stake .
17482	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	But many analysts question whether Giuliani can remain competitive in those large states without at least some hint of success in the early rounds.
17483	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The last Detroit News-WXYZ Action News poll of Republican voters, in mid-December, showed Giuliani in third place at 12 percent, down 16 points from a month earlier.
17484	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"History says he needs some success before Florida to be successful in Florida," said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which has surveyed Florida voters throughout the year.
17485	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The danger, Brown said, is that the lead Giuliani held in Florida and other large states throughout the summer and fall may disappear .
17486	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's camp has fought against such perceptions for months
17487	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	campaign manager Michael DuHaime told reporters in November that Giuliani's leads in Florida, New York and New Jersey were "momentum-proof," unassailable by any candidate, even one who swept through the early contests.

17489	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa winner Mike Huckabee is an also-ran in New Hampshire, where Romney and McCain are battling in a close race.
17490	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	After Michigan comes South Carolina's Jan. 19 primary, in which Huckabee, McCain, Romney and Fred Thompson all have gotten significant support in recent polls.
17491	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a fractured field is all Giuliani could have hoped for, said Miller.
17492	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"We talked about this strategy very early on: Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," she said.
17493	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"It makes some people nervous, but we've talked about it for months: The thing to do is to win delegates."
17494	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The math is compelling.
17495	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire today will award 21 delegates to this summer's national convention
17496	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa technically awarded none at all.
17497	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Florida will award 114, which the Feb. 5 states combine for roughly half the overall total.
17498	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Miller said Giuliani will try to win at least a handful of Michigan's 60 delegates (30 if the national GOP's penalties against the state stick), focusing on congressional districts where the campaign's internal polling shows it has the best chance to win.
17499	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The winner in each of the state's 15 congressional districts receives three delegates, with 15 more going to the statewide winner.

17502	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	A new study may help quiet fears that the suicide warning labels on antidepressants are scaring countless patients away from medications that could help relieve their suffering.
17503	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The warnings, which were mandated in 2004 by the Food and Drug Administration, say the drugs can increase the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior in some young patients.
17504	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They stirred a fierce debate among psychiatrists, health officials and patient advocates, with critics saying the ruling (and the headlines that accompanied it) went too far.
17505	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the study, which appears Tuesday in The Archives of General Psychiatry, finds that while the warnings appear to have alerted patients and doctors to a possible risk, they have not caused a sharp decline in treatment rates.
17506	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The report is not likely to be the last word on the antidepressant debate, experts said.
17507	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But they added that it provided one of the clearest pictures to date of how patients and doctors behaved in the wake of a controversial decision by drug regulators.
17508	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The researchers analyzed prescription rates from three time periods: May 2002 to June 2003, just before the debate over antidepressant side effects flared
17509	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	June 2003 to October 2004, the period after the first public alert, that the drug Paxil by GlaxoSmithKline was associated with an increase in suicidal thinking in minors
17510	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	and October 2004 to December 2005, the year after the FDA called for prominent warnings on the labels of all antidepressants.
17511	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They found that the rate of Paxil prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased by 44 percent after the 2003 warning on that drug.
17512	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the rate for similar drugs, including Prozac by Eli Lilly, continued to increase in that age group through 2003 and fell off only slightly after the labeling change, in 2005.
17513	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The rate of prescriptions to new patients -- a particular concern for psychiatrists critical of the warnings -- did not change significantly during the warnings or after.
17514	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	Prescription rates to adults increased in the years studied.
17515	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	In sum, the drug agency's warnings seemed to prompt caution rather than panic.
17516	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	"The concern that the warnings would have a chilling effect on the treatment of depression in young people was not borne out by the data," said the study's lead author, Mark Olfson, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.

17519	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17520	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	For a giddy moment there, sanity broke out all around and Congress, with bipartisan support no less, enacted and President Bush signed an actual, genuine gun-control bill.
17521	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	The federal government during the next five years will provide $1.3 billion in grants to gig the states into perfecting their records of individuals who are disqualified by mental illness from purchasing guns and then filing that information with the national database gun dealers use to check purchasers' eligibility.
17522	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	This patently should have been the case all along, but the bill was opposed by the gun lobby and flopped when it was introduced in 2002.
17523	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	It took the deaths of 32 students and faculty and the wounding of two dozen more at Virginia Tech last year to shame the recalcitrant into concurrence.
17524	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	The killer, Seung Hui Cho, had been adjudicated an "imminent danger" to himself and others by a state court but was able even so to buy the two guns he used for his massacre.
17525	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Even the National Rifle Association, which ordinarily sees a wolf hiding in every common-sense gun proposal, didn't cry its practiced faux alarm this time.
17526	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	And the Bush administration, which had played the key role in putting semi-automatic assault weapons back into civilian circulation, went along.
17527	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Which portents - well, absolutely nothing, of course.
17528	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Despite this rare lapse, the NRA and the rest of the gun lobby are otherwise busy about their usual business of working - mostly through state legislatures, with appalling success - to put more firearms in more hands and in more public spaces.
17529	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	The noisiest reaction to the recent murder of nine in a shooting spree in a Omaha mall denounced the ban many malls have on customers packing heat.
17530	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	If only shoppers had been armed, the complaint went, they could have shot that sorry sucker dead.
17531	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	And collateral damage from a bunch of amateurs blasting away in panic in a crowded mall?
17532	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Never mind.
17533	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Although the gun lobby is pushing for more concealed weapons and to open parks, workplaces, arenas and other public spaces to them, we are hardly a disarmed people even with those faint inhibitors in place.
17534	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Reuters news service, in a piece last year, reported that the United States is the most heavily armed nation in the world.
17535	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	We have 90 guns per 100 of us, nearly a third of all the world's private firearms.
17536	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Other industrialized western nations have gun murders in, at most, the low 100s annually.

17540	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Firearms are our eighth leading cause of death.
17541	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Meantime, the gaping legal loophole that allows gun-show sales without background checks goes unplugged.
17542	NYT_ENG_20080110.0091.LDC2009T13	Congress hustles to protect gun makers from lawsuits and crooked or irresponsible dealers from investigation and would limit local law enforcement access to federal data that could help trace crime guns.

17547	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	BOSNIA BIGGER WORRY THAN KOSOVO
17548	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
17549	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	2008 will be a pivotal year for both Kosovo and Bosnia.
17550	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Kosovo will likely declare independence from Serbia in the next few months.
17551	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If it does, the United States and most members of the European Union will recognize Kosovo, but will insist upon the establishment of an international mission similar to the United Nations Office of the High Representative in Bosnia to ensure the new state's stability.
17552	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Serbia and its patron Russia will strongly oppose any move towards independence by Kosovo, but what form that opposition will take is uncertain.
17553	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Contrary to some news reports, Serbia will not demand control of the Serb entity in Bosnia - or Republika Srpksa (RS) - in exchange for the loss of Kosovo.
17554	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Doing so would almost certainly lead to a direct confrontation with the United States and European Union.
17555	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Neither Serbia nor Russia wants that.
17556	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Despite the tensions surrounding Kosovo's independence, a full- scale conflict is unlikely.
17557	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	And despite the sentiment in some quarters for Kosovo remaining an autonomous province of Serbia, the prospects of that occurring are close to zero.
17558	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	An independent Kosovo will be a weak state for many years to come, but it will not be (or allowed to be) a threat to the region.
17559	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the political future of Bosnia is murky.
17560	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	For almost two years, Bosnian politicians have quarreled, often quite bitterly, about the constitutional future of the country.
17561	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian Serbs and to a lesser degree the Bosnian Croats, both minorities in relation to the Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks), have sought to consolidate their political status under Annex 4 (the constitution) of the Dayton Agreement.
17562	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	For the Serbs, now lead by the powerful RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, the goal is preservation of their entity and a weak central government.
17563	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosniaks, on the other hand, under the leadership of Haris Silajdzic, have pushed for a strong central government.
17564	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The international community has tried without much success to navigate these opposing positions.
17565	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	A set of amendments to the constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament.
17566	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	EU-led efforts at police reform were likewise rejected in October.
17567	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of national legislation easier.
17568	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	These reforms essentially challenged the practice of elected representatives and government ministers of absenting themselves from key votes.
17569	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	RS politicians, who frequently deployed this tactic to avoid being outvoted, interpreted these reforms as a threat to the entity and to their ethnic protections at the state level.
17570	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	They provoked a crisis by demanding that the High Representative rescind his measures.
17571	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	With support from Serbia and Russia, RS Prime Minister Dodik threatened the secession of the Serb entity.
17572	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
17573	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains unresolved.
17574	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The political situation is now fraught with uncertainty for a number of reasons.
17575	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	First, the international community is anxious to end the U.N.'s Dayton mission and turn the reform effort over to the EU.
17576	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
17577	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	However, the events of the past six months have clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to go it alone.
17578	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Second, during the past year the RS economy has grown rapidly while that of the other entity, the Bosniak-Croat Federation, has stagnated.
17579	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The RS may not be hesitant about using its new economic power to push for more devolution of political power.
17580	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Bosnia is at a precipice.
17581	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If the international community commits itself to finishing the job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a constitutional government capable of serving all the people of Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future of the country will brighten considerably.
17582	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If, however, the international community turns its back on Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next year.
17583	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In view of the enormous investment that the international community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.

17587	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Why is it they make movies out of crummy '70s television series ("Starsky and Hutch," "Charlie's Angels,") but not good '70s television series?
17588	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Yes, there were some - and not only sitcoms.
17589	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Where, for example, is the movie version of "The Rockford Files"?
17590	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Jim Rockford very much belongs in the great, shaggy tradition of the LA detective.
17591	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Philip Marlowe is only the most famous (James Garner, who played Rockford, took a swing at Raymond Chandler's creation in a 1969 film version of "The Little Sister").
17592	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	There's also J.J. Gittes, Lew Archer, Joe Friday, Easy Rawlins.
17593	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	In fact, Easy Rockford might be a more suitable name for Garner's character.
17594	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Rockford has a relaxed unflappability that's a major factor in the show's appeal.
17595	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Rockford's personality also owes something to Elliott Gould's take on Marlowe, in Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye" - though the Malibu where Rockford parks his trailer is a lot different from the one Gould's Marlowe contends with.
17596	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	"The Rockford Files": Season Five consists of 20 episodes on five discs, with no extras.
17597	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Well, Rockford always was a no-frills sort of guy - except for that answering machine which opened each episode.
17598	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Even if he didn't get much respect on the air, he did offscreen.

17606	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	The leader of one of America's most venerable civil rights groups kicked off his annual celebration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in what might have once seemed an unlikely fashion: by ringing the opening bell Friday morning at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
17607	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Roy Innis, the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, clapped and cheered beside Dennis Bassford, the chief executive of Moneytree Inc., a chain of check-cashing stores, as the towering video screen outside Nasdaq's media center beamed the scene onto Times Square.
17608	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	At its dinner on Monday night in honor of King's birthday, the civil rights group plans to salute Bassford for providing access to credit for poor communities and spreading financial literacy.
17609	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Niger Innis, the group's national spokesman and Roy Innis' son, explained, "You want to have leverage in our society, the color is not black or white -- it's green."
17610	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	As the federal holiday approached, many New Yorkers, from Caribbean business leaders to labor organizers taking aim at Starbucks, found a resonance in King's birthday that was almost post-racial.
17611	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They talked about empowering the poor and the working class, and about identities more complex than just black and white.
17612	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Strikingly often in those discussions, they mentioned a name that they said had brought fresh meaning to the holiday: that of Sen. Barack Obama, the first black candidate widely seen as having a shot at the presidency.
17613	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"Barack's campaign -- like him or not, support his policies or his politics or not -- the brilliance of this black man winning in Iowa and nearly winning in New Hampshire is a huge victory for Dr. King's dream," Niger Innis said.
17614	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean that the fight is over, but the battlefield certainly has changed."
17615	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	To some, Obama's candidacy recalls the way King expanded his focus to include economic and foreign policy issues shortly before he was assassinated 40 years ago in Memphis, Tenn.
17616	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"Dr. King had become very unpopular before his death, talking about things that black men did not have the right to talk about," George Hulse, aboard member of the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said over bagels Friday at the chamber's King breakfast.
17617	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"They could not talk about economic issues.
17618	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They could not talk about international affairs.
17619	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They could not talk about world issues," said Hulse, vice president of external affairs for Healthfirst, an HMO.
17620	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Many of the people who had Obama on their minds as King's birthday celebration approached emphasized that they had not decided whether to vote for him.
17621	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	His main opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, also enjoys support among civil rights leaders and blacks.
17622	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	And many of the organizations that commemorate the holiday are nonprofit groups that by law cannot endorse candidates.
17623	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Rather, Obama's name came up alongside King's as people declared that the civil rights leader was no longer a symbol only for blacks, or as they expressed hope that the two senators would resist temptations to focus the campaign on race and gender.
17624	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Roy Innis said he was glad they seemed to have pulled back from a dust-up over Clinton's remark that King's work came to fruition after President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
17625	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's so funny when someone tells the truth and they have to apologize for it," he said of Clinton.
17626	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"LBJ knew the redneck opposition and busted their kneecaps and broke their arms.
17627	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	So it was a collaboration between King and the civil rights movement and LBJ."
17628	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Debra Lesane, who is helping the Caribbean business group plan seminars on banking and credit, said at the breakfast that if King were alive today, he would be deploring the subprime mortgage crisis, which has disproportionately affected minority homeowners.
17629	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Paraphrasing King, Bassford, the Moneytree executive, agreed.
17630	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not good enough to have all the rights to engage in all the areas of commerce, if you don't have the ability," he said at the Nasdaq ceremony.
17631	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"What good is it to be able to sit at the lunch counter if you don't have the money to buy a hamburger?"
17632	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Economic issues also were at the forefront for people who felt disconnected from the holiday.
17633	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	The Industrial Workers of the World has chosen the King holiday to protest against Starbucks for not providing holiday pay to its workers on that date.
17634	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	But some baristas said they had never heard of the campaign by the union, which is fighting to organize them.
17635	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's just a day like any other, like all holidays," said Fernando Heredia, 22, who often works holidays at the Starbucks at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.
17636	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Just outside the Nasdaq ceremony, Jordan Ramos, 19, on a cigarette break in Times Square, said that he would not get the holiday off from his media services job, and that King loomed larger for his Puerto Rican grandmother, who lived through the civil rights struggle.
17637	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	But he said he had come to connect King's message to issues of more immediacy for him, like immigrants' rights.
17638	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not just about African-Americans but about all minorities, how we're all treated," he said.
17639	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Nearby, Idris, 35, an immigrant from Ghana who declined to give his last name, said he could not take the holiday off because he is paid on commission for selling tour bus packages to passers- by.
17640	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	He said that he felt excluded in the United States, and that King's message held little reassurance.
17641	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's an American thing to me," he said.
17642	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	NEWLYWEDS SEETHING AFTER A PHOTO STUDIO FAILS TO DELIVER
17643	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Michael Ruiz de Somocurcio, a health insurance executive from Clifton, N.J., paid $5,500 to Celebration Studios, a regional photography service, before his wedding in September.
17644	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The price included albums, personalized thank-you notes and a DVD starring his wife, Erika, and himself.
17645	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	But the products never materialized.
17646	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The company, with offices in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, closed this month and is filing for bankruptcy, its lawyers say.
17647	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of couples have been left with no visual record of their wedding day, and many brides-to-be who had made down payments now have no wedding photographers lined up.
17648	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	So instead of paging through their albums, newlyweds are filing police reports and lawsuits, and sifting through posts on Internet bulletin boards.
17649	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	And, along with people who are not yet married but who paid Celebration Studios in advance, they are vetting countless online offers from album makers, video editors and last-minute photographers engaged in what one bride-to-be called "ambulance chasing."
17650	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the New Jersey attorney general's office filed a civil lawsuit against the company and its owner, Marc S. Schwartz, citing fraudulent practices.
17651	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	It also issued an order to prevent them from selling or disposing of the wedding images that had not been delivered.
17652	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"When you're playing with people's memories, it's not a beautiful thing," said Ruiz de Somocurcio, 30, who has no images from his wedding other than snapshots sent to him by friends.
17653	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Until recently, Celebration Studios had a reputation for producing good work at a reasonable price.
17654	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Couples frequently took advantage of a 10- to 20-percent discount for paying in full in advance.
17655	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Last week, it was offering photography packages priced up to $3,995 and video packages costing up to $2,295 on its Web site, which has since shut down.
17656	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	But the company's fortunes recently plummeted.
17657	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Federal tax liens of more than $456,000 and a New Jersey tax lien of more than $86,000 have been filed against Celebration Studios in the last two years, court records show.
17658	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The Montclair Police Department received about 40 fraud reports about the company from Jan. 11 through Jan. 18, said Deputy Chief Roger Terry.
17659	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	He said the department had not filed charges, pending the outcome of various court cases.
17660	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Jeffrey Herrmann, a lawyer for Celebration Studios, provided a copy of a statement from the company, which read: "The primary intent of Celebration Studios has been and remains to preserve the memories of its customers.
17661	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Unforeseen financial difficulties have made it impossible to continue our business operations and deliver photos and videos in a timely manner."
17662	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The statement added that "to our knowledge, no photos or videos have been lost or destroyed."
17663	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Herrmann said that the copyrights of the images currently belonged to Celebration Studios.
17664	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Schwartz did not respond to e-mail messages sent to two addresses for him, and there was no response to phone messages left for Celebration Studios last week.
17665	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Herrmann said Celebration Studios would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in Newark in the next week.
17666	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	News reports of complaints about the company appeared last week in The Star-Ledger of Newark and on Philadelphia and New York television stations.
17667	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Photographers say they, too, have been cheated by the company.
17668	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Josephine Donatelli, a photographer from Scotch Plains, N.J., who worked with Celebration Studios before opening her own studio, said she had received checks from Celebration that had stop- payment orders on them, and other checks that bounced.
17669	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She eventually got paid, after waiting three months.
17670	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"When you do a wedding, it's a 14-hour day often, and you spend a lot of money in gas and put your whole heart into it, and then you don't even get your gas money back," she said.
17671	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	According to the suit filed by the New Jersey attorney general, Anne Milgram, the nine-year-old company "engaged in the use of unconscionable commercial practices, false promises, misrepresentations and/or the knowing concealment, suppression or omission of material facts."
17672	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Nathaniel Burney, a Manhattan lawyer, filed a lawsuit against the company in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in December and is seeking a class-action certification for it.
17673	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"As of 2005, obviously Celebration Studios knew that people were not getting their pictures, and since then they continued soliciting and taking people's money," he said, citing problems at least two years old.
17674	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"People are giving them their family heirloom photographs and baby pictures, and not getting the pictures of the most important days of their lives."
17675	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Melissa Brown, a New Jersey lawyer and bride who said she was defrauded by the company, is also planning a lawsuit.
17676	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She said she stood to lose $5,700.
17677	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	One bride-to-be, Lisa Trapasso of Ossining, N.Y., said she felt betrayed by Celebration Studios.
17678	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She and her fiance, Robert Mockel, a New York City firefighter, paid $3,500 to the company to shoot their June wedding.
17679	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"He's working two jobs to pay for the wedding, and I feel like this money has been stolen from us," Trapasso said.
17680	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"I feel rabid about it."

17701	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Klitschko's trainer, HBO commentator and legendary cornerman Emmanuel Steward, said it's no surprise.
17702	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	"Florida is the training capital of the world," said Steward, who lives in Detroit.
17703	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	He has worked training camps for Lennox Lewis, Michael Moorer and Jermain Taylor in South Florida.
17704	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Steward said boxers are drawn to Florida for an obvious reason.
17705	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	"Boxers don't want to worry about slipping and falling on ice when they're running," he said.

17711	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	He said boxing fits in with the resort's effort to be more hip.
17712	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Many guests, he said, appreciate the glamorous side of the sport.
17713	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Friday night, the resort will host its first boxing show in its 840-seat ballroom.
17714	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	The card features local fighters from local gyms, not the big names training in the tent.

17719	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	At his temporary home here, Klitschko has a full-time cook.

17723	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Soon enough, Klitschko wanted to train in the same time zone as New York in a city with boxing fans, fair weather and a suitable gym.
17724	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Rassman, who has lived at PGA National for 20 years, arranged for a tent and Klitschko moved in three weeks ago.
17725	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	"It is logic.
17726	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Conditions here are perfect," Klitschko said.
17727	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	He has not golfed, though, because he says he is a 36 handicap and can't tolerate the daylong depression a round would bring.
17728	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	But Steward, 63, played for the first time in his life Wednesday.
17729	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Steward also is working with 10th-ranked cruiserweight Jonathan Banks and undefeated Irish middleweight Andy Lee in the PGA National tent.
17730	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	The tent has a ring, a heavy bag, a full-length mirror and three flat-screen TVs on which Klitschko watches a constant rotation of Ibragimov's past wins.
17731	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Klitschko works out to Salt-N-Pepa's "Push It" and attempts to dance to Tone Loc's "Wild Thing" in between grueling rounds.

17748	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	With 10 weeks left in the season, they're 12th in the East and need to make up ground to reach the playoffs.
17749	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	It's been that way for five seasons in a row.
17750	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers say they are determined to end their agonizing playoff drought.
17751	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	But some observers think the Panthers haven't exhibited enough determination to reach the post-season for the first time since April 2000.
17752	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	To put it more bluntly, some critics think they are soft.
17753	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"This team plays too much on the perimeter
17754	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I haven't seen the willingness to get their noses dirty and do the dirty work," said NHL broadcaster John Vanbiesbrouck, who starred in the nets for the Panthers when they reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1996.
17755	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Winning isn't easy.
17756	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You've got to make up your mind you're going to do whatever it takes to get there and play like that every night."
17757	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have done that only intermittently during the first 51 games.
17758	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Despite their uneven play - they have won only four of their past 14 games - they are only three points out of the Southeast Division lead and five out of eighth place.
17759	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's good that we're still there
17760	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I'm more optimistic than years before," captain Olli Jokinen said.
17761	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"But there's way too many 'ifs' and 'buts.'
17762	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Now it's time to go out and do it."
17763	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	That is what NHL Network analyst Gary Green would like to see.
17764	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack grittiness."
17765	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I'm not talking about having enforcers
17766	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	it's more banging in the corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their opponents," Green said.
17767	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They won't make it if they don't find a way to get that."
17768	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1 when trailing after the first period.
17769	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"The games they've won they've had the lead from the first period on," Panthers announcer Denis Potvin said.
17770	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They've got to be winning third periods.
17771	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You can go into the third period down by one or two and still win that period.
17772	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	(They) haven't been winning that period."
17773	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have been outscored 61-47 in the final 20 minutes.
17774	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Vanbiesbrouck said he also has been disappointed by the production of several secondary scorers, most notably Nathan Horton (12 goals, 26 assists) and Stephen Weiss (9 goals, 20 assists).
17775	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While they rank second and third on the team in points, neither has had the breakout year many expected.
17776	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score," Vanbiesbrouck said.
17777	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Weiss said: "I want to have more points.
17778	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	It's not for lack of chances.
17779	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I just have to bear down in the crease area, make sure pucks are going in the net."
17780	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"You've got to have two lines scoring," Potvin said.
17781	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One could make the argument that when the Jokinen line was going the Weiss line was not, or the Weiss line was going and the Jokinen line wasn't.
17782	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	One line just isn't enough."
17783	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost, Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
17784	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Potvin also said players have to take it upon themselves to stop being whistled for untimely penalties.
17785	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Only last week, a hooking call against defenseman Jassen Cullimore with 2:21 left opened the door for Edmonton's rally in what proved to be a crushing 4-3 shootout loss.
17786	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Several players conceded that the team is maddeningly inconsistent.
17787	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Early, late, or sometimes in the middle of games, a loss of focus will prompt a salvo of opposition shots that often as not overwhelm goalie Tomas Vokoun.
17788	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some games we're slower at the beginning, then pick it up," defenseman Ruslan Salei said.
17789	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some we play well from the beginning.
17790	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I can't give an answer why."
17791	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Jokinen also is perplexed.
17792	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One night it's there, the next it isn't," he said.
17793	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's 31 games now.
17794	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	We have to make up our mind
17795	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	we really have to buy into this or we're just going to waste another year."
17796	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	If that happens and Columbus makes the playoffs - the Blue Jackets returned from the break tied for eighth in the West - the Panthers would become the only team in the league to fail to reach the post-season since 2000.
17797	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	That in turn would force majority owner Alan Cohen to face a host of questions concerning the future of everyone from fourth-liners to Jokinen to coach and General Manager Jacques Martin.
17798	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"We've got to play dirty hockey, we've got to play hard every night, and there's no time for a letdown," forward Radek Dvorak said.
17799	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"We have to play 60 minutes of hockey."

17811	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
17812	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea transplant.
17813	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
17814	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.
17815	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This isn't terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened yesterday.
17816	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	(Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie critics.)
17817	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of Hong Kong.
17818	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a surprise, the movie was a drag.
17819	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This American version has been directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, two Europeans who've transplanted the story (wanly adapted by Sebastian Gutierrez), the corneas, and the mediocrity (are those death-ghosts from the afterlife or Roswell?)
17820	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	.
17821	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
17822	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But we've been here before, no?
17823	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
17824	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's a notch above this, their Hollywood debut.
17825	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The noise and cheap bumps in the night from the Pangs' movie have been toned down, but without them you realize that atmosphere was all the Pangs had going for them.
17826	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.
17827	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But Alba, with her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan").
17828	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.
17829	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But even Hewitt's face has a range of feeling.
17830	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Her voice has pleasingly rich character.
17831	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"
17832	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She narrates "The Eye."
17833	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.
17834	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	"People say seeing is believing... Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."
17835	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	All I can see is jeans.
17836	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alba spends a lot of her scenes with Parker Posey, who plays Sydney's guilty sister
17837	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alessandro Nivola, who plays her sight therapist
17838	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
17839	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	as, well, some unhappy Mexican lady.
17840	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.
17841	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But they are here enough for you to appreciate the experience in their faces versus the disruptive purity in their costar's.
17842	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
17843	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished niceness she radiates on screen.
17844	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's terrible for horror or action or comedy or drama.
17845	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But it's perfect for, say, water.
17846	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She was never more convincing than she was as Paul Walker's moral- minded girlfriend in the tropical thriller "Into the Blue."
17847	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.
17848	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	If she's going to keep doing fright movies, maybe she can be the Esther Williams of horror.

17856	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	The Super Bowl beast gets bigger every year.
17857	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Sure, when the game came to Tampa in 2001, it brought along an impressive menu of party options and a constellation of Hollywood faces for stargazers.
17858	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	But when it returns in 2009, expect an avalanche of both driven in part by new media options, ranging from the NFL Network to original programming for mobile devices, and more public events hosted by the NFL.
17859	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Bill Smith, chairman of the Phoenix Convention Bureau, said the hoopla surrounding this year's Super Bowl has been light years beyond what he saw in 1996, the last time Arizona hosted the game.
17860	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"This is so different from before," he said.
17861	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"Massively."
17862	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year, the traditional Nike, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Maxim and Playboy parties were on tap, with access limited to VIPs and those with plenty of disposable income.
17863	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	But John Travolta, Sean "Diddy" Combs, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg to name a few also lent their names to events, some with tickets available for as little as $15, and others going for more than $1,000.
17864	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Common folk could buy tickets to the Pepsi Smash Super Bowl concert series, which is broadcast on VH1.
17865	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Last year, before the Super Bowl in Miami, the concerts featured Fergie and John Legend.
17866	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year it was Mary J. Blige and Maroon 5, with tickets available for less than $50.
17867	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the NFL this year hosted Super Bowl Saturday Night, which includes a free concert by the Counting Crows and a fireworks show.
17868	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Krista Soroka, director of events and hospitality for the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee, said she spoke to the NFL about possible locations for a similar event in the bay area next year.
17869	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Locals welcome
17870	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"The NFL is trying to create more opportunities for the locals to be involved," she said.
17871	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Soroka is part of a Tampa Bay contingent that fanned out across Phoenix, Glendale and surrounding areas this week to get a taste of what to expect next year.
17872	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	The group hosted a party Thursday night that had some star power of its own.
17873	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, who's leading the planning effort for the 2011 Super Bowl in North Texas, stopped by, and former Vice President Dan Quayle popped in to rub elbows with the legendary ballplayer.
17874	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Reid Sigmon, executive director of Tampa's host committee, said he and his staff have touched base with multiple media outlets gearing up for 2009 in Tampa.
17875	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	In 2001, about 3,500 media-types received credentials to cover Super Bowl activities in Tampa.
17876	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year, a record 4,786 credentials were issued to U.S. and international media from print, television, radio and Internet outlets.
17877	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	When Tampa last hosted a Super Bowl, ESPN radio broadcast from a corner of the Marriott Waterside Hotel with a staff of 16 people.
17878	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"That was basically a couple of tables put together," said Keith Goralski, senior director of operations and events for ESPN Productions.
17879	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"Now we have multimedia sets."
17880	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Corporate excess
17881	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	The outfit brought a staff of 40 to Arizona and broadcast radio shows from stages in Phoenix, Glendale and Scottsdale with the programs shown on television and the Internet and sent to the mobile devices of Verizon Wireless subscribers.
17882	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Sprint set up stages in Phoenix and Scottsdale, from where it sent celebrity and athlete interviews with the likes of 50 Cent, Paris Hilton, Jerry Rice and Barry Sanders directly to Sprint subscribers.
17883	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"This is a space that everybody wants to be in," said Josh Wine of Intersport, which produces original content for Sprint.

17890	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	MICROSOFT ADVERSARY RISES INSTINCTIVELY AT YAHOO BID
17891	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	More than a decade ago, Andrew S. Grove, then the chief executive of Intel, aptly described the hypercompetitive mentality of Silicon Valley in his book title, "Only the Paranoid Survive."
17892	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, the anxious efforts by Google, led by its chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, to try to scuttle Microsoft's $44.6 billion bid for Yahoo may well seem like a bout of Valley paranoia.
17893	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	After all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
17894	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
17895	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
17896	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His animosity toward Microsoft has long been publicly understated and analytic in quality.
17897	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	At Sun, he stood at an amused distance from the entertaining antics of the chairman, Scott G. McNealy, who railed against Microsoft and its leaders, Steven A. Ballmer and Bill Gates, as "Ballmer and Butthead."
17898	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
17899	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Yet he is openly taking on Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash. "This could be a signal that he's going to go straight at Microsoft, including disrupting their deals," said George F. Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research.
17900	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"This looks like the beginning of the formal war."
17901	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
17902	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
17903	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in a statement Sunday afternoon that the proposed deal posed a threat to "the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation."
17904	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt called Yahoo's chief, Jerry Yang, to offer help, perhaps a partnership.
17905	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
17906	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.
17907	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Google's response looks like an overreaction, even a little panicky, to me," said Michael Sheridan, a venture capital adviser who worked with Schmidt at both Sun and Novell.
17908	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"But for Eric, it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door."
17909	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is a computer scientist who worked as a researcher at Bell Laboratories and at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center before moving into management.
17910	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	He is every bit as comfortable talking about software scripting languages as he is discussing corporate strategy.
17911	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior technology -- a common belief in Silicon Valley.
17912	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
17913	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt's concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, when it used its dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers and media players, according to people who have talked with Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not authorized to speak for him.
17914	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	If Microsoft buys Yahoo, it will have more than an 80 percent share in markets like consumer e-mail accounts on the Web and instant messaging.
17915	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
17916	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.
17917	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
17918	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
17919	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.
17920	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It is an assault that is just getting under way.
17921	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative desktop programs.
17922	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
17923	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"That's the dagger at the heart of Microsoft," said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and an author of the school's case study on Google.
17924	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"And that's why Microsoft is so eager to have a response.
17925	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
17926	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whether Google's concerns about Microsoft are justified is unclear.
17927	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
17928	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The longer Microsoft's purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online business remains unsettled.
17929	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft's use of the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN search service.
17930	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for searching.
17931	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
17932	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service.
17933	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was not anti-competitive.
17934	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
17935	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
17936	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
17937	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the two powerful companies have different business models that seek proprietary advantage in different places.
17938	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
17939	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court," he said.
17940	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The big software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows monopoly by stifling rivals.
17941	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem."
17942	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"At Google," Schmidt added, "we had a long conversation about, if we became a big company, how could we avoid that.
17943	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of technical things we can do and have done.
17944	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data.
17945	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is important because if" you can move your data from Google, you always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google.
17946	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is absolutely not true in Microsoft's history."
17947	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google is hoping that Microsoft's past will hamper its effort to become more formidable in the online business.
17948	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.

17950	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Authorities say he used an e-mail alias, Ed Guitterrez, to communicate with at least two teenage boys.
17951	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He gave one alcohol.
17952	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He convinced them to let him take nude photos of them, and for them to take nude photos of themselves.
17953	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	And when they agreed, he mailed them payments, sometimes hidden inside computer disc cases so parents would not be suspicious.
17954	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He offered at least one of the boys $200 in exchange for oral sex.
17955	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
17956	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Al Zimmerman, 40, a former spokesman for the Department of Children and Families, was arrested on a federal child pornography production charge at his parents' home in Lakeland, his second arrest in about a week.
17957	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He's being held in the Hillsborough County Jail.
17958	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal criminal complaint reveals more details about how authorities think Zimmerman victimized at least two teenagers and possibly more over several months' time.
17959	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman paid two teenage boys money to pose nude and masturbate for photographs between 2006 and 2007, authorities say.
17960	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	They say he took some of the photos on a Canon camera
17961	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	others were sent to Zimmerman by the teens on his cell phone.
17962	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman met one of the boys, a foster child, through his job.
17963	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	At a first appearance hearing in the Tampa federal courthouse Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Murphy-Davis argued that Zimmerman should not be released on bail, calling him a community danger.
17964	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	She said Zimmerman was so obsessed with talking to underage boys that he used his work computer to constantly ask them to send him pornography that he could sell.
17965	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	In one message dated June 29, 2007, authorities say he wrote one of the teens: "If you can get a hold of a camera that you can use regularly whether it's a cell phone cam or regular digital, I could sell a few pics here and there every month and make you 100 to 200 a month in cash, or 50-80 depending on if they're just shirtless or naked."
17966	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	But Zimmerman's attorney, Brian Albritton of Tampa, asked Judge Mark A. Pizzo to delay a bond hearing.
17967	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He said he wanted Zimmerman's parents to be present so they can testify that their son won't skip bail if he's granted a release.
17968	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	His parents have already put up their house as collateral for $120,000 bail after he was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Feb. 2, he said.
17969	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He returned to the jail Monday.
17970	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, formerly of Tallahassee, had been living with his parents in his hometown of Lakeland until he was picked up Monday on the federal charge.
17971	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The judge agreed with Zimmerman's attorney and scheduled the bond hearing for 1:30 p.m. today.
17972	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Federal marshals took custody of Zimmerman in the meantime, leading him out of the courtroom Monday evening in leg shackles.
17973	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Monday's charges are the newest in the case against Zimmerman, a friendly and respected press secretary whose Feb. 1 arrest on eight state child pornography shocked DCF officials, reporters who worked with him and longtime friends.
17974	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, a former television journalist who earned $75,000 as a DCF spokesman, previously worked as a reporter at Bay News 9, KENS-TV in San Antonio and WMAZ-TV in Macon, Ga.
17975	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	DCF spokeswoman Erin Geraghty described Zimmerman's actions as "a betrayal of trust" and said the agency would continue to cooperate with the investigation.
17976	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	If convicted of the federal charge, Zimmerman could get a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 15 years.
17977	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He could get up to 120 years if convicted of the eight state charges.
17978	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal case will be prosecuted before the state case, Murphy-Davis said.
17979	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman has worked with the DCF since 2005, first as spokesman for the department's District 13, which includes Citrus and Hernando counties, and then as a spokesman in Tallahassee for the entire state agency.
17980	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	When authorities recently arrived at Zimmerman's Tallahassee home with a search warrant, they found a DCF computer technician, Michael Hernandez, in his driveway, the complaint states.
17981	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez told investigators that he had thrown Zimmerman's home computer in a Dumpster at Zimmerman's request.
17982	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez also told them two days earlier he had "wiped" and reformatted Zimmerman's laptop computer at his co-worker's request.
17983	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says Zimmerman admitted he was "involved in a pornography business."
17984	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told investigators the first victim showed him identification stating he was 18 years old, but Zimmerman said he suspected the card was a fake.
17985	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says he also told investigators he knew the second victim, who was in foster care and was a runaway at one time, was 17 years old.

17988	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	There are some things that a girl just can't get along without on the big day.
17989	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	But even the necessities can be made nice:
17990	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Specs
17991	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Those funky, chunky black specs that define you as a cultural creative in the office might be a bit too jarring for your wedding get-up.
17992	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you need eyeglasses, are disinclined to wear contact lenses and think prenuptial vision correction surgery falls into the category of budget-buster, think about picking out some special frames for the big day.
17993	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Heidi Tanner, manager of DisRespectacles in Denver, says some women can pull off an over-the-top frame, but she typically steers brides-to-be toward frames that are "a little more minimal, softer and feminine."
17994	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Pick from a lineup of new jeweled frames, or select a vintage frame.
17995	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Among Tanner's favorites at the moment is a white Vivia frame, studded with silver sparkles, handmade in France by Francis Klein.
17996	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	They run about $515, not including lenses.
17997	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Vintage frames are less expensive, averaging around $125 in the eyeglasses store, and are way less expensive if you shop at garage sales or thrift stores.
17998	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Expect to spend about $160 for lenses.
17999	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And, yes, you do need the anti-reflective coatings -- you don't want flash photography to bounce off your glasses.
18000	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Getting your frames fit with new lenses can be done pretty quickly, but Tanner recommends getting the work done a few weeks in advance, just to be on the safe side.
18001	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Old frames can be very fragile, so if you've chosen vintage frames, select an optician who has experience with old specs and will handle your glasses with lots of TLC.
18002	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Hair
18003	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Whether you're veiling up or approaching your vows bareheaded, chances are good you'll want some kind of hair ornament, possibly including fresh blooms.
18004	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you're thinking of adding flowers to your 'do, make sure to do a trial run with the hairstylist.
18005	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you have very short hair and don't plan to have a pro help with styling, a trial run is especially critical.
18006	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"You can definitely overwhelm yourself with flowers," says Teresa Henry, owner of Boulder Blooms, a top wedding-flower design studio in Boulder, Colo. "If the bride will do the whole trial run thing, with the hairstylist, and hairpiece, they know exactly what they're getting."
18007	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If a test run isn't in the budget, spend time going over -- in excruciating detail -- what you want from a headpiece.
18008	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Henry says she also tries to develop combs and pins that can be placed in the bride's 'do right before the ceremony or pictures.

18040	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
18041	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the manufacturer of a federally approved medical device cannot be sued under state law if the device causes an injury.
18042	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	By 8-1, the court ruled in favor of Medtronic, the Minneapolis-based maker of a balloon catheter that burst and severely injured Charles R. Riegel while he was undergoing an angioplasty in 1996.
18043	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Riegel and his wife, Donna, sued the company in federal court, contending that the catheter had been designed, labeled and manufactured in a way that violated state law, and that those defects had caused severe and permanent injuries to Riegel.
18044	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But a federal district court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, dismissed the Riegels' suit on the ground that the catheter had been given pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration, thus protecting the manufacturer from liability under state law.
18045	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal courts on Wednesday, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority that Medtronic and other manufacturers were protected under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre- emption bars states from imposing on medical devices "any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter."
18046	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But the justices' ruling was hardly the last word on when FDA approval bars patients from suing.
18047	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	They are already considering at least three cases involving drugs and drug-labeling.
18048	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Scalia wrote that the FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each device application and grants pre-market approval only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of its "safety and effectiveness."
18049	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives," Scalia wrote, noting that the FDA approved a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts "even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent."
18050	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The majority was apparently persuaded by Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer for Medtronics, who argued before the justices on Dec. 4 that the FDA and not the courts was the right forum for imposing requirements on cutting-edge medical devices.
18051	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Arguing that "nothing is perfectly safe," Olson argued that it would harm patients and future patients to "discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives."
18052	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Medtronic, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cardiovascular devices, no longer makes the type of catheter used on Riegel, who died several years after the operation.
18053	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter on Wednesday, asserting that the majority had adopted an unnecessary "constriction of state authority."
18054	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Ginsburg said she did not believe that Congress had intended to bring about "a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices."
18055	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	In this case, the Bush administration had taken the side of the medical-device industry, arguing argued that there would be "serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits" if juries could second-guess the agency.
18056	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Allison M. Zieve, the lawyer for Donna Riegel, expressed her disappointment to Bloomberg News.
18057	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"Pretty bad for patients, pretty good for industry profits," she said.

18104	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The pope could easily lose the respect his office deserves by the divisive decisions he has recently made.
18105	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He offended the Jewish community directly and, indirectly, insulted every thoughtful person.
18106	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Save that such actions are tragic for the church and the world, they would be quickly dismissed in any rational consideration of the church catholic.

18108	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He behaves, however, as if he were running an exclusive club with no need to consider the sensibilities or intelligence of that world.
18109	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."
18110	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	That is such an affront to the Jewish community that the international assembly of Conservative Rabbis meeting this week is considering a resolution to condemn the prayer for endangering the mutual respect engendered in recent years.

18127	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany
18128	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The successor to the East German Communist Party won representation in the legislature of the northern city of Hamburg on Sunday, confirming a leftward political shift across Germany.
18129	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The results, after a similar outcome in two state elections in January, come amid an increasingly sharp conflict in Germany about whether the former Communists, known as the Left Party, would be a viable political partner in Hamburg and elsewhere in Germany.
18130	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	That dispute, in turn, is worsening already fractious relations between the two large parties of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government in Berlin.
18131	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	Though a tiny slice of the German political landscape, Hamburg has in the past few weeks taken on an outsized importance as a test case for whether Germans, weary of years of belt-tightening economic restructuring, would drive the political center of gravity further left.
18132	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The vote on Sunday confirmed the trend, with the Left Party winning 6.5 percent of the vote, according to German public television's preliminary exit polls.
18133	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The city's popular mayor, Ole von Beust of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, won 42.7 percent, stripping him of the absolute majority he has used to govern for the last four years.
18134	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The Social Democrats, the pillar of Germany's center-left, won 34.1 percent.
18135	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The Left Party, a combination of former Communists, disillusioned Social Democrats and western radicals, won enough votes last month in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony to win parliamentary representation.
18136	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	While the Left Party is well represented in the east and has parliamentary seats in the northern city-state of Bremen, it had never sat in one of the large western states' parliaments.
18137	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The votes contributed to a brewing sense of political helplessness.
18138	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	"The German political system is now effectively in gridlock," said Jackson Janes, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, a research group based in Washington.

18149	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Another attack on Shiite pilgrims marching to the holy city of Karbala killed at least four people on Monday, just a day after a suicide bombing left 52 dead.
18150	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In the latest attack, two car bombs exploded in the Karada district of southeast Baghdad, killing four people and wounding at least nine, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials.
18151	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	The blasts were the third attack on Shiite pilgrims observing Arbaeen, which commemorates the end of the 40-day mourning for the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and one of Shiite Islam's most revered holy men.
18152	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	At least 57 pilgrims have been killed during two days of attacks and more than 100 have been wounded.
18153	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	"We condemn this atrocity against innocent Iraqi citizens who were exercising their right to participate in a religious commemoration," said Col. Allen Batschelet, the chief of staff at Multinational Division Baghdad.
18154	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In the remote mountains of northern Iraq on Monday, Turkey's military for a fourth day battled fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, attacking Kurdish hide-outs with fighter jets and ground artillery.
18155	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Monday's fighting brought the death toll to 17 Turkish soldiers and as many as 153 Kurdish fighters, the Turkish military said, though the PKK has reported far lower numbers of its own deaths.
18156	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Farther south, neither the continuing violence nor the rainstorms that swept over central Iraq on Monday stopped the thousands of Shiite pilgrims walking along highways, bearing red, green and black banners to the Shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala for the Arbaeen observance.
18157	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Iraqi security officials announced new measures to safeguard the pilgrims, and the minister of state for national security, Shirwan al-Waeli, was investigating the circumstances of Sunday's bombing in Iskandariya, 45 miles south of Baghdad.
18158	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Aqeel al-Khazaaly, the governor of Karbala, estimated that 5 million pilgrims had traveled to the city by Monday and said he expected more than 9 million by the time the commemoration ends Thursday.
18159	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Maj. Gen. Ali Ghedan of the Iraqi army said he had deployed additional soldiers to reinforce security along roads leading to Karbala.

18162	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Violence also swept through Diyala province, just north of Baghdad.
18163	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Gunmen killed an Iraqi man in a garage in Baquba and a woman in a residential area on the city's southern outskirts.
18164	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In Balad Ruz, about 15 miles west of Baquba, an improvised bomb detonated near an Iraqi security official's house, wounding two people.
18165	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere in Diyala province, U.S. forces in Khan Bani Sad killed a suspected insurgent during a raid.
18166	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In the northern city of Mosul, U.S. military officials announced Monday that insurgents fired on a military convoy on Sunday, killing an Iraqi boy who was playing in the street nearby.
18167	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, U.S. troops detained Hafidh al-Beshara, the news editor of a prominent Shiite-run television station, and his son in a Friday night raid aimed at disrupting Iranian-backed militia groups, The Associated Press reported Monday.
18168	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Troops had sought the son in the raid, but Beshara was detained as well after an unauthorized machine gun was found on the premises, the report said.
18169	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Turkish officials have withheld precise figures for the number of soldiers involved in the Turkish military's ground operation against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq.
18170	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	But Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said the figure initially cited by Turkish news media -- 10,000 troops -- had been "very exaggerated."
18171	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	The ambassador said in a telephone interview: "This operation will be limited in size, scope and duration.

18174	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	The men had been kidnapped in 2004, and their abduction highlighted the peril faced by tens of thousands of so-called "third-country nationals" working in Iraq, many of them from impoverished nations, working for little pay and few benefits.

18176	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	ON THE MONEY
18177	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were here to promote "The Counterfeiters."
18178	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Ruzowitzky wrote and directed and Markovics stars in the based-on-fact drama about a massive Nazi-run counterfeiting operation during World War II that used concentration camp prisoners.
18179	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	.
18180	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But their excitement was already evident about the possibility of winning this year's best foreign language picture Oscar - which, in fact, "The Counterfeiters" did.
18181	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics and Ruzowitzky spoke of the award with mounting animation - though not enough to mar their fluent, moderately accented, English.
18182	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when asked if the award had much meaning a continent away.
18183	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an event."
18184	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are back home," Ruzowitzky said.
18185	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"For the Austrian public, a film festival doesn't mean anything - whereas 'Academy Award' is just immense.
18186	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
18187	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism, or its absence, is a central concern in "The Counterfeiters."
18188	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him.
18189	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's a crook, a survivor - but also a master of his trade and a man who does his best to protect his fellow workers.
18190	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But by doing so, he's helping the Nazi war effort.
18191	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	(The idea behind the counterfeiting scheme was to destroy the British and US economies with a flood of phony pounds and dollars.)
18192	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Is Sally a hero?
18193	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
18194	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Neither?
18195	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"No, he's not a hero," Markovics said.
18196	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe in heroes - and he doesn't either.
18197	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are no heroes under these conditions.
18198	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There's only surviving to the next day and being able to face yourself in the mirror."
18199	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism isn't the point, Ruzowitzky said of Sally.
18200	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"He himself believes he has no ideals or principles.
18201	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Then we find out he does have ideals.
18202	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good citizen.
18203	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But he definitely has them."
18204	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.
18205	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The printers take pride in their work because they are, in their way, artists, too.
18206	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A counterfeiter is not unlike an actor or filmmaker.
18207	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Each earns his income creating a version of reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
18208	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of Sally.
18209	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
18210	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he appears in "The Counterfeiters."
18211	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Bearded and amiable, he could be a professor playing hooky from MIT, a few blocks away from the Hotel Marlowe, where the interview took place.
18212	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Of course I look different," he said with a smile.
18213	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to be in a concentration camp."
18214	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference is more than just a matter of having put on a few pounds.
18215	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
18216	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I always have fun playing characters not really hiding but giving the impression there's much more under the surface," Markovics said.
18217	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"This always attracts me more than showing everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing.
18218	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	This character especially gave me a chance to do this."
18219	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The source of the movie is a memoir by Adolf Burger.
18220	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger, who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his radical political views.
18221	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He tried to sabotage the forgeries, risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
18222	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger is played in the movie by August Diehl.
18223	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
18224	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In a camp, you can't do the right thing or the wrong thing.
18225	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	All these different perspectives are understandable.
18226	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and is the one who stands up against the Nazis.
18227	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So actually we shot some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow.
18228	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Why?
18229	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Because in real life we can identify with his approach, which is, yeah, I'm just trying to get along, not change the world, be a human."
18230	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	World War II seems very much a thing of the past to his generation, said Ruzowitzky, who's 46.
18231	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's the Holocaust, rather than the war, that I think about.
18232	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That's a real difference.
18233	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For Americans the war is Omaha Beach, Iwo Jima, battles, soldiers.
18234	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For us, I don't know any battles.
18235	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Talking about the Second World War is talking about the Nazis, talking about the Holocaust."
18236	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
18237	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The one hard and fast rule he had while filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's point of view.
18238	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
18239	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"So our master shot, which is usually in old-school filmmaking a wide shot from an objective point of view, was always following Sally - over his shoulder.
18240	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	We never, ever did a shot over-shoulder of one of the Nazis.
18241	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger says in the movie, 'I'd never be in the place of an SS criminal.'
18242	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	My ((director of photography)) and I felt this should be true for us as well."
18243	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Counterfeiters" makes clear the Nazis' evil, but that doesn't mean it fails to acknowledge the various moral complexities arising from the title characters' situation.
18244	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are ways in which the World War II film it most resembles isn't one about the Holocaust but "The Bridge on the River Kwai."
18245	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In that picture, British POWs working on a railroad bridge for the Japanese become emotionally attached to the project - as the counterfeiters do to theirs.
18246	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"That aspect is there," Ruzowitzky agreed.
18247	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"If you meet Mr. Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone: whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
18248	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But as soon as he starts discussing these works of art they were producing there, and how well they worked, and even the Bank of England thought they were right, his eyes light up!
18249	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's so proud, because he's a printer, and this was quite an achievement for them."
18250	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The response to "The Counterfeiters" (it's been sold to more than 60 countries) speaks to a greater interest in German-language films generally, Ruzowitzky said.
18251	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The success of movies like 'Lives of Others' and 'Downfall' ((the 2004 release in which Bruno Ganz played Hitler)) has helped us a lot.
18252	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	People are aware that there are new German movies which succeed in combining difficult issues and present them in an accessible way.
18253	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Entertaining may be the wrong word for a concentration camp movie, but it is accessible.
18254	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	You're not tortured if you go watch this movie.
18255	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	I think German-language movies are quite successful these days."
18256	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign- language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for "The Counterfeiters."
18257	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's not just the films themselves that have won, though.
18258	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?'
18259	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's her Oscar as well."

18262	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	MADRID, Spain
18263	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	They are two angry political warriors bearing grudges from the past, convinced the other is a liar and an incompetent destined to destroy the country.
18264	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	As Spain prepares for a general election on Sunday, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on the left and Mariano Rajoy on the right are poised for a rematch of their bitter contest four years ago.
18265	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	It was then that Zapatero unexpectedly swept to victory, ousting Rajoy's Popular Party from power as enraged voters protested the government's mishandling of terrorist bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid three days before the election.
18266	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The candidates have used this year's campaign not only to lay out starkly different visions for Spain but also to settle personal scores.
18267	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Rajoy still contends that he was a victim of circumstances in 2004, robbed of victory after his party insisted that the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA was responsible for the attack, despite evidence that pointed to radical Islamists.
18268	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, the election swept in a government that lacked legitimacy and since then has abused its mandate by shattering family values, weakening the economy, embracing unworthy immigrants and coddling terrorists.

18280	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	NEW DELHI
18281	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	There are two routes to the world's highest peak and both are scheduled to be off limits to mountaineers this spring, as Beijing strives to inaugurate the summer Olympic Games free of pro-Tibetan protests.
18282	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	Beijing announced earlier this week that the route to the summit of Mount Everest along the north face of the mountain, in Chinese-controlled Tibet, would be closed.
18283	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	Now, Nepal has decided that at least between May 1 and 10, when China has said it plans to carry up the Olympic torch, no one will be allowed to scale the summit along the south face, which is in Nepal.
18284	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	Nepal's tourism minister, Subba Gurung, confirmed in a telephone interview on Friday that the Chinese government had appealed to his administration to help prevent disruptions to the Olympic torch ceremony.
18285	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	"Expedition teams will not be allowed to ascend Mount Everest from the Base Camp," on the Nepali side, he said.
18286	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	"They are requesting us, the government of Nepal, to be very careful on this side," he said of the Beijing authorities.
18287	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	He went on to say that his ministry had also pressed tour operators to be extra vigilant of teams scheduled to climb the mountain before May 1, allowing only climbers who are known to the operators.
18288	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	Nepal's decision underscores its vulnerability to pressure from its large and powerful neighbor to the north, even if it involves forsaking lucrative earnings from expedition permits.
18289	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	The tourism industry is among Nepal's most important sources of revenue, and permits to scale Mount Everest alone brought in $4 million into government coffers last year, a significant amount for what is one of Asia's poorest countries.
18290	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	China's plans to have the Olympic torch carried into Tibet over Mount Everest have drawn protests from groups that advocate greater autonomy for Tibet, including among monks in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa.

18336	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
18337	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Howard D. Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced sweeping changes on Wednesday for the company as it seeks to reconnect with customers who have left for competitors or pared back their coffee budget in hard economic times.
18338	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The initiatives are intended to restore an authentic coffeehouse experience to the company's stores and, in turn, re-energize an ailing stock that has lost half its value in the last 15 months.
18339	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow customers to see baristas making their beverage.
18340	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He said the company would roll out the Swiss-made Mastrena machines to three- fourths of Starbucks stores by 2010.
18341	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one cup at a time.
18342	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The price was not disclosed.
18343	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will roll out Clover systems in select markets.
18344	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz described a host of other plans: a pungent new coffee blend, a partnership with Conservation International to certify environmentally responsible whole-bean espresso products, and a rewards program for users of the Starbucks customer card.
18345	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Beginning in mid-April, users of the customer card will be able to customize their drinks -- with soy milk or vanilla, for example -- at no cost.
18346	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The announcements are intended to help Starbucks hang on to customers in the face of intensifying competition for brewed coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, which is widely introducing espresso beverages this year.
18347	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This was more of a position statement.
18348	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	They are going back to their core," said Sharon Zackfia, a securities analyst with William Blair &amp
18349	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	amp
18350	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Co. "They are saying, 'We are not going to change who we are, we are going to defend turf aggressively."'
18351	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters.
18352	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people are making unique claims about coffee and what they do," he said.
18353	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"What's interesting to me is that they are not coffee roasters."
18354	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	But Schultz tried largely to keep the focus on the company's internal challenges and future moves.
18355	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time the U.S. business is under pressure.
18356	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	It's a character test," he said.
18357	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
18358	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
18359	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
18360	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Don't believe the media hype.
18361	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	There's no coffee war going on.
18362	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
18363	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
18364	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
18365	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
18366	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis.
18367	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
18368	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the face of those pressures, Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago.
18369	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He quickly announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least profitable Starbucks stores in the United States.
18370	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He also said Starbucks would stop selling a line of breakfast sandwiches that were served warm, creating an aroma that overwhelmed that of the coffee in stores.
18371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the company's early devotion to high-quality coffee.
18372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The new coffee blend, called Pike Place Roast, is a reference to the location of the first Starbucks store.
18373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will introduce the blend in stores next month.
18374	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Baristas will be directed to brew smaller batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30 minutes.
18375	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
18376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
18377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community, mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will contribute to a corporate blog.
18378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Customers will also be encouraged to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with employees.
18379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
18380	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
18381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
18382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
18383	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The last innovation widely thought to be successful was the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
18384	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz partly has his own relentless ambition to blame for the woes at Starbucks.
18385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, citing ever-larger expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity to one another and to competing coffee shops.
18386	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
18387	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
18388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
18389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event as early as 6 a.m.
18390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	As a barbershop quartet sang and employees dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
18391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm.
18392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks is his heart," said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was there with her husband, Bill.
18393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I have every confidence he will turn the company around so this stock can take our family on our 50th wedding anniversary trip next year."
18394	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	DOCTOR WHO ADVANCED USE OF THORAZINE DEAD 87
18395	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Frank J. Ayd Jr., a psychiatrist who by studying his patients' responses to early antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs helped give birth to and nurture the field of psychopharmacology, died Monday in Baltimore.
18396	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He was 87.
18397	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
18398	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd's clinical results were usually influential and sometimes stunning.
18399	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In May 1955, he reported at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association on his use of two antipsychotic drugs, chlorpromazine, best known by the trade name Thorazine, and reserpine.
18400	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd, who received the first permit from the Food and Drug Administration to use Thorazine to treat schizophrenia, found that many of the 300 patients he treated with the drugs no longer needed hospitalization in a specialized setting and could be treated in a general hospital or nursing home.
18401	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He said 80 percent were usefully employed.
18402	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported that his finding had "profound economic implications," because it offered a way to cut the $1 billion the nation was then spending on mental illness.
18403	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It said many patients could receive immediate treatment and avoid long- term hospitalization.
18404	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases.
18405	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He tested his patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to new drugs, then quantified the results.
18406	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This placed him at odds with the more impressionistic traditions of psychiatry, and more in tune with the biological approach favored by many European researchers.
18407	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in an interview Thursday.
18408	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was there at its inception as a scientific area of focused research."
18409	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd worked at a time when there was considerably less government and academic regulation, and when clinicians were able to experiment more freely with emerging drugs to find good uses for them.
18410	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and his contemporaries.
18411	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd contributed to more than 50 books and wrote more than 400 articles.
18412	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His "Ayd's Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology and the Neurosciences" is a standard reference.
18413	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He helped start the Collegium Internationale Neuro- Psychopharmacology and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.
18414	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In 1966, he established his own journal, the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
18415	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It changed its name last year to Psychopharm Review.
18416	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in higher doses were even more effective.
18417	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It emerged that the powerful antipsychotic drugs often had powerful side effects.
18418	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In an interview on Thursday, Dr. J. Raymond DePaulo, chairman of the psychiatry department at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, emphasized that Ayd was as aggressive in investigating the side effects of psychiatric drugs as he was in gauging their potential.
18419	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo said.
18420	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"This wasn't theoretical for him.
18421	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This was about treating the patient with something that would help them."
18422	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized mentally ill people being released without adequate support systems because of effective drugs.
18423	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Janicak said Ayd tried to find ways to "give a voice" to the often inarticulate mentally ill.
18424	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to equally strict analysis.
18425	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	DePaulo said Ayd tested on his patients one of the first tricyclic antidepressants, an early and important class of drugs for severe depression.
18426	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist.
18427	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He graduated from Loyola College in Baltimore and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
18428	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His residency in pediatrics was interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a veterans' hospital.
18429	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	A biography prepared by the alumni association of his medical school said Ayd treated a wide array of veterans.
18430	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Some were violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from cold.
18431	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Once a patient stuffed his clothes full of newspaper and set himself on fire.
18432	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd is quoted as saying in the biography.
18433	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He had burns on at least 20 percent of his body.
18434	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It fascinated me that he had no real sense of pain."
18435	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd immersed himself in psychiatry and began giving Thorazine to patients with delusions in 1952.
18436	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The drug saved some from what then seemed to be unavoidable lobotomies.
18437	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd went on to become chief of psychiatry at Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore from 1955 until 1962, then left to lecture in Europe.
18438	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	From 1962 to 1965, he lectured at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
18439	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He later worked at the Taylor Manor Hospital in Ellicott City, Md., and retired in 2003.
18440	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In addition to his daughter Loretta, of Hunt Valley, Md., Ayd is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Rita Anne Corasaniti
18441	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	his sons Frank III, of Parkville, Md., Joseph, of Towson, Md., Thomas, of Showell, Md., Vincent, of Cedarcroft, Md., and John, of Timonium, Md.
18442	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	his other daughters, Margaret Reid of Towson, Va., Simpson of Umbria, Italy, Teresa Knott of Towson, Martha Teitelbaum of Troutdale, Va., Christina Lears of Catonsville, Md., and Rita O'Brennan of Timonium
18443	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	his sisters, Jane Morales of York, Pa., and Regina Brockmeyer of Parkville
18444	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	his brother, Robert, of Parkville
18445	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	32 grandchildren
18446	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	and 38 great-grandchildren.
18447	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In an interview with Psychiatric Times in 2005, Ayd predicted many better drugs would be developed, but said the challenge was for doctors to learn to use them properly.
18448	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"Otherwise, it would be like giving a driver's license to someone who can't drive," he said.
18449	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	IN THE END, TENNESSEE LIVES UP TO SEEDING
18450	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
18451	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Garrison Carr, an American University guard, had just made another 3-pointer and the 15th-seeded Eagles trailed by a point with six minutes remaining against second-seeded Tennessee on Friday in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
18452	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Scared?"
18453	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee forward Tyler Smith said.
18454	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't say scared.
18455	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
18456	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The arena section where American fans were sitting was revved up and hoping for more of Carr.
18457	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The American band played the song "Don't Stop Believin"' and a fan held up a sign that read "The American Dream."
18458	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The dream was about to end.
18459	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr did not make another 3-pointer, and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult 72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
18460	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr, a 5-foot-11 junior from the Seattle area, scored a game- high 26 points, making 9 of 21 field goals.
18461	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	For most of the game, he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the Tennessee defense.
18462	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by spreading out the Volunteers on defense.
18463	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Tennessee big men were stuck outside trying to help on screens being set for Carr.
18464	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
18465	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's a race to the boards."
18466	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The difference in the game was a two-minute stretch that ended with about four minutes left in the second half and with Tennessee holding a comfortable lead.
18467	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	JaJuan Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, was playing tough defense on Carr, staying closer than arm's reach, and would not let him get another good look at the rim.
18468	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said.
18469	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I turned it into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him.
18470	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	I wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
18471	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for Tennessee.
18472	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a 3 down," Carr said.
18473	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
18474	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Volunteers took a 63-53 lead as American managed just one field goal over its next nine possessions.
18475	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Smith finished with 19 points to lead Tennessee.
18476	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Carr plays 40 minutes and Mercer plays 39," Pearl said, referring to American guard Derrick Mercer.
18477	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
18478	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31 free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.
18479	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Chris Lofton, Tennessee's leading scorer (16.1 points), was only 1 of 7 from the field.
18480	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament.
18481	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Simon was averaging 7.2 points.
18482	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl came to his postgame television interview on the floor still wiping the sweat from his brow.
18483	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Most expected his team to have an easy time of it.
18484	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference regular-season championship and was briefly ranked No. 1.
18485	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Now, there is some question how fit the Volunteers will be Sunday against seventh-seeded Butler, which defeated South Alabama, 81-61.
18486	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did not show any discouragement afterward.
18487	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"This is the NCAA tournament," Pearl said, "and no matter how we try and prepare you guys to understand that this is what it is, this is what you get, you just think that we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way."
18488	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	A FEW TENSE MOMENTS AS U.C.L.A. PREVAILS
18489	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	PHOENIX
18490	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The differences between No. 1 UCLA and No. 12 Western Kentucky were far greater than their seedings.
18491	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Each program entered the West Region semifinals of the NCAA tournament with starkly different styles.
18492	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated on running and trapping.
18493	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
18494	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.
18495	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA survived scary second- half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with an 88-78 victory.
18496	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA (34-3) is on the cusp of becoming the third team to reach a Final Four in three consecutive years since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.
18497	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins would join Michigan State and Duke.
18498	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
18499	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	For Western Kentucky (29-7), the lopsided loss ends a dazzling season that saw the Hilltoppers storm through the Sun Belt tournament and into America's consciousness when Ty Rogers' 3-point heave topped Drake in overtime in the first round.
18500	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
18501	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-8 sophomore forward James Keefe finished with 18 points.
18502	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Keefe's career high coming into the game was eight.
18503	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Kevin Love scored a career-high 29 points and added 14 rebounds.
18504	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But UCLA struggled mightily in the second half against the Hilltoppers' full-court pressure, which allowed Western Kentucky to creep within four points and perpetuate UCLA's reputation as a team that can always make a game close.
18505	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That's something that could haunt the Bruins as they advance.
18506	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky cut the UCLA lead to 61-57 with less than seven minutes remaining when Tyrone Brazelton blew past Darren Collison for a layup.
18507	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The basket capped a personal 8-0 run by Brazelton.
18508	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA answered with a basket from Love and UCLA ended any notion of a threat when Josh Shipp hit a line drive 3-point shot with 4 minutes 33 seconds remaining to spread the lead back out to 68-59.
18509	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA held Western Kentucky to 18.8 percent shooting in the first half and 34.7 for the game.
18510	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins built their halftime lead with inside dominators.
18511	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Love had 15 first-half points while Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for seven points in 10 minutes.
18512	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up, leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in anticipation of their game against Xavier.
18513	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That game will be an intriguing matchup.
18514	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA will enter as a heavy favorite despite Xavier's 30-6 record and having a list of victories this season that includes Indiana, Virginia, Auburn, Georgia, Purdue and West Virginia.
18515	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	And those are only the ones from outside the Atlantic 10.
18516	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut defense.
18517	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked No. 5 nationally in scoring defense.
18518	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins yield only 58 points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
18519	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is the erratic play of Collison, the point guard.
18520	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He fouled out with four points.
18521	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He turned the ball over four times and had only one assist in the Round of 32 against Texas A&amp
18522	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	amp
18523	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	M, a narrow Bruins victory.
18524	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.
18525	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	THORNTON HAD THE UPPER HANDS
18526	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Against Ottawa, Bruins' Thornton had the upper hands
18527	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His name is not on the scoring summary, but Shawn Thornton left an impression in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators yesterday.
18528	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Twice the burly fourth-line wing saw a teammate knocked to the ice and stepped into the offending Senator with his fists cocked, standing up for his teammate, hockey-style.
18529	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates, and his coach.
18530	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks.
18531	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's the best time of year to play - the last 10-15 games and the playoffs, that's what you're playing for.
18532	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	As a kid, no one's saying, 'It's Game 22, who wants to play for the Cup?'
18533	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	when you're playing road hockey."
18534	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
18535	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and Thornton helped shake it loose.
18536	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The first period was slogging along scoreless when Neil caught Jeremy Reich at the Ottawa blue line with an elbow, forcing Reich from the game with a head injury.
18537	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	A few minutes later, Thornton called Neil aside and opened up a little chat with his fists.
18538	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on Reicher," said Thornton.
18539	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see it because I was forechecking right away.
18540	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"We know what's on the line, all 20 guys are playing hard and that's the best thing it's done.
18541	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	We're down again after ((Reich)) left, and everyone pulled up their socks again, so congrats to everyone for standing in there."
18542	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period, but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded scrum.
18543	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart skated slowly off the ice with his left arm hanging.
18544	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton was incensed.
18545	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Or maybe just pumped up.
18546	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His body language betrayed his rink rage.
18547	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	No time to chat, Cody Bass, say hello to my fist.
18548	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I thought it was a high-stick ((on Stuart))," said Thornton.
18549	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It was more reactionary than anything else.
18550	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I had just come on the ice and I saw Stuart laying there.
18551	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's our house and I don't want people taking liberties with one of my teammates, especially if I'm on the ice.
18552	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I'm not going to let that slide."
18553	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Though Stuart returned a few minutes later (he called the injury to his right arm a "stinger"), Thornton had made his point.
18554	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"First of all, we know what he did to step up and protect our players because there were a couple of questionable hits there," said Bruins coach Claude Julien.
18555	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"He stepped up and did his job that way.
18556	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Also, what hopefully didn't go unnoticed is that he played a solid game, too.
18557	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	He was good along the wall, he was skating well, he got pucks in deep, and he played a pretty good hockey game tonight.
18558	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"You have a tendency to think of those guys as one-dimensional players, but he played more and more as the game went on because he was so reliable."
18559	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart acknowledged the game is a little easier knowing Thornton is around.
18560	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game," Stuart said.
18561	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton, who has four goals and three assists in 54 games, had a slow start to the season, and missed 20 games with a foot injury, but returned in mid-December, leaner and fitter, and just as mean.
18562	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's anybody in the league I haven't got my mitts off with," he said.
18563	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I can take care of myself, and if that has to be done, I don't put too much thought into it.
18564	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Our line did a pretty good job going out there and maybe controlling the play in the other team's end and getting some bangs in.
18565	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	There's other ways to change momentum ((than fighting)), we've figured that out as a line, and we've been trying to do our best."

18567	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	INSURERS CITED AS CAUSE OF CLOGGED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY SYSTEM
18568	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle- blowers.
18569	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies are the source of the problem, the lawsuits say.
18570	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers are forcing many people who file disability claims with them to also apply to Social Security -- even people who clearly do not qualify for the government program.
18571	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially.
18572	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.
18573	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers say that requiring a Social Security assessment is a standard practice and that there is nothing wrong with it.
18574	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice.
18575	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Thus, if a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else -- like workers' compensation, a disability pension or Social Security -- the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that amount.
18576	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The flood of referrals, however, is making it hard for Social Security to respond to people who are truly disabled, said Kenneth D. Nibali, the former top administrator of the Social Security disability program.
18577	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"Anybody who is forced to come into this system, and who doesn't need to be there, is affecting someone else," said Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as an expert witness for the plaintiffs.
18578	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"They're holding up cases for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in many cases are much worse off."
18579	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security.
18580	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old- age trust fund.
18581	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work force ages, since recovery time increases with age.
18582	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The number of people waiting for hearings on their claims by an administrative law judge has more than doubled since 2000, and the average wait has grown to 512 days in that time, from 258 days.
18583	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration is not an active participant in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them.
18584	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	D.C. TO PUMP OIL LEADERS ON GASOLINE
18585	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	UNDATED
18586	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Gasoline prices broke records again Monday as triple-digit oil prices kept pressure on the pump, giving Congress a well-timed set-up as it prepares to grill oil executives today on soaring energy costs.
18587	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The national average price for regular unleaded climbed a fraction of a penny to $3.29 a gallon, up 12 cents from a month ago, AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report said.
18588	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	In Houston, the average reached $3.22 a gallon, up 17 cents from last month, the motor club said.
18589	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The records came on the eve of a congressional committee appearance by executives from the nation's five largest oil companies.
18590	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The title of the hearing -- "Drilling for Answers: Oil Company Profits, Runaway Prices and Pursuit of Alternatives" -- hints at the reception industry leaders may expect from the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
18591	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"This new gas prices record is a perfect example of why we need these oil companies to go on the record with the American people to discuss our dangerous dependence on oil," said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the panel.
18592	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	With pump prices high and the economy limping, U.S. gasoline demand has declined recently.
18593	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	After growing at an average 1.5 percent for a decade, gasoline demand growth slowed to 0.4 percent in 2007 and demand is down 0.8 percent through the first 12 weeks of 2008, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
18594	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	U.S. gasoline stockpiles have swollen nearly 10 percent above their five-year average in response, a situation that historically might have helped cool down pump prices.
18595	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	But $100-a-barrel crude oil has changed the equation and is exerting a huge influence on the price of gasoline, said John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group.
18596	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The price of crude, which typically accounts for about 48 percent of the price of gasoline, accounts for 70 percent of the pump price today, he said.
18597	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Weak returns refiners have posted recently attest to the industry's struggle to absorb higher crude costs, Felmy said.
18598	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	On Monday, light, sweet crude for May delivery fell $4.04 to $101.58 in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
18599	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	But it is still up more than 50 percent from a year ago.
18600	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The difference between what refiners pay for a barrel of oil and the price they get for products made from it is known as the gross refining margin.
18601	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	This figure is widely used as a rough indicator of the profitability of the refining business.
18602	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	At current levels, refiners are seeing a margin of about $10 per barrel of gasoline they produce, about half of what they've made during early spring in recent years, said Eitan Bernstein, industry analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp
18603	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	amp
18604	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Co.
18605	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	He projects that for 2008, refining margins will average $12 a barrel, about 33 percent lower than last year's record $17.50 a barrel but still high by historical standards, he said.
18606	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Refining margins often rise sharply in the spring and summer months as gasoline demand increases during the vacation season.
18607	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The government anticipates pump prices will peak at a monthly average of $3.50 a gallon sometime this spring as vacation driving begins, topping $4 in some markets.
18608	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	If that holds true, the price will surpass the inflation-adjusted record of $3.40 a gallon set in March 1981.
18609	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"Gas prices are outrageous," said John Jardell, 33, as he paid $20 to pump six gallons into his 1995 Lexus sedan Monday at a Texaco station at Richmond and U.S. 59.
18610	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"I'm not able to put in as much gas as I used to."
18611	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Erick Hereda, a plumbing supply salesman, had the same complaint.
18612	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"You gotta have gas," Hereda said, putting $5 worth into his 1999 Chevy Tahoe at a Valero station on Westheimer.
18613	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"What are you going to do without it?"
18614	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	A prominent consumer group released a report last week suggesting oil companies are constricting U.S. fuel supplies and keeping prices high.
18615	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Declining gasoline demand, flush fuel inventories and rising ethanol output should have eased pump prices, the Consumer Federation of America said.
18616	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Instead, the industry has used its market power to cut production and maintain that pressure, the group said.
18617	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	API officials flatly denied that allegation Monday.
18618	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"There's no way you can make those claims," Felmy said in a conference call.
18619	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"They simply just don't hold water."
18620	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	John Seesel, associate general counsel for energy at the Federal Trade Commission, said he also sees no reason to suspect deliberate price manipulation.
18621	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"I've never seen a credible allegation that private oil companies have much market power in crude oil, which appears to be the biggest driver," Seesel said.
18622	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The FTC has investigated the refining industry in the past for possible price manipulation and found nothing, he said.
18623	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The office has no active probe in progress, he said.
18624	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Today, Congress will take a turn putting the industry under the microscope.
18625	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Scheduled to appear at the hearing are J. Stephen Simon, senior vice president of Exxon Mobil Corp.
18626	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	John Hofmeister, president of Shell Oil Co.

18663	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock comes roaring out of the gate so furiously at the beginning of "Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?"
18664	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	you wonder how he's going to keep the energy up.
18665	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Well, he doesn't, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
18666	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Spurlock grabs your attention in the film's opening 15 minutes with a mad attack of bells and whistles and graphics and jokes.
18667	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	He even displays full-on videogame graphics in which he battles Osama.
18668	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	And then he settles into a calmer, more contemplative groove as the film progresses.
18669	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Of course this is somewhat unavoidable since he spends the balance of movie traveling through the Middle East.
18670	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	The sobering side of life is hard to ignore when you're wearing a bulletproof vest in Afghanistan.
18671	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Spurlock, the jaunty guy who overdosed on fast food to grand documentary success in "Super Size Me," begins "Osama" with the news that his longtime love, Alexandria, is pregnant.
18672	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Suddenly he's struck by how dangerous a world their child will be entering.
18673	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	So he sets out to make it safer by hunting down Osama.
18674	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	This eventually leads to him doing things like walking through a Middle-Eastern mall asking people if they've seen Osama, and standing outside a cave in Afghanistan, yelling in, "Yoo-hoo!
18675	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Osama?"
18676	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Yes, modern documentary sarcasm is alive and well in Morgan Spurlock.
18677	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	But so is modern humanism.
18678	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Because in reality what Spurlock shows in "Osama" is that the majority of regular Muslim folk in the many countries he visits -- Israel, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan -- have no use for Osama and his tactics.
18679	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Most actually consider him a major pain in the butt.
18680	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Not that they're all enthusiastic about America these days, and the terrorists do have their sympathizers.
18681	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	But they are comparatively few.
18682	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Most want nothing to do with religious feuding and blame politicians for the ungodly messes going on in Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
18683	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Spurlock isn't really looking for Osama
18684	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	he's looking for the people Americans mistake for Osama, the people too easily lumped together under a convenient, misleading banner.
18685	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	And although "Osama" wraps up a bit too quickly, and ends a bit too obviously, the thing Spurlock finds is, for the most part, these people resemble us.

18690	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO
18691	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening its belt.
18692	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better- tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving some consumers with less discretionary income.
18693	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"This is a very tough operating environment for us, and we're not alone," Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive, said in an interview.
18694	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to reflect the tough economy."
18695	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said second quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7 million, from $150.8 million a year earlier, while per-share earnings declined 21 percent, to 15 cents, from 19 cents.
18696	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
18697	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company said revenue rose 12 percent, to $2.5 billion.
18698	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than- expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic environment as the weakest in the company's history.
18699	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Wall Street analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
18700	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Most recently, Starbucks has suffered the effects of the crisis in the housing market, particularly in southern California and south Florida.
18701	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
18702	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
18703	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbuck's shares.
18704	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The stock, which fell 11 percent after the company's warning last week, rose 3 cents, to $16.23 a share, in regular trading.
18705	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"This is certainly a positive step," said Larry Miller, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
18706	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
18707	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue.
18708	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.
18709	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
18710	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"There are no sacred cows."
18711	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020 stores this year, down from its previous target of 1,175, and to open fewer than 400 stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
18712	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
18713	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
18714	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to $800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011.
18715	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
18716	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
18717	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service.
18718	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company also announced three new cold beverages.
18719	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures.
18720	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company expects revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent this year.
18721	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.

18766	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	A MAYOR ' S FALL FROM GRACE
18767	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	It was nothing more than the mayor's annual budget speech, but in Newton, the event had all the trappings of the president's State of the Union address.
18768	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	A delegation of aldermen escorted Mayor David Cohen into the chamber of Newton's huge Georgian Revival-style City Hall.
18769	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Everyone was asked to rise.
18770	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen stepped forward, followed by an entourage of city department heads.
18771	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His smile looked more pained than happy, and he waved stiffly at board members and the handful of people who sat in the audience.
18772	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.
18773	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once heralded as a brilliant state legislator and a can-do mayor loved by the wealthy and well-connected in his hometown, Cohen, 60, is expected to make an announcement today about his election plans for 2009.
18774	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Many of his allies expect him to call it quits.
18775	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The fall from grace followed missteps richly woven into a city that prides itself on good schools, parks, and expensive real estate.
18776	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The new $197 million high school Cohen has staked his reputation on has become the most expensive school construction in state history and a symbol of suburban excess.
18777	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The local weekly twice called for him to leave office at the end of his term.
18778	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen has put forward a controversial $12 million property tax override, threatening teacher and police cuts and library branch closings if it does not pass.
18779	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	And in the midst of these battles, Cohen this week proposed increasing his salary of $97,876 by 28 percent, quickly withdrawing the idea after it was greeted with derision.
18780	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"It is a sad irony that the mayor may best serve the city he loves by announcing that he will not run for another term," said longtime supporter Paul Levy, CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
18781	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has become a kind of lightning rod on the ((override)) issue.
18782	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	People have said to me that they would otherwise vote yes, but are uncomfortable doing so with him in office beyond this term."
18783	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the day the proposed salary increase became public, Cohen sat in his oak-paneled office and in an interview defended the high school, the override, and his reputation.
18784	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There have been some concerns that the programming is extravagant, that the building" is extravagant, Cohen said, growing angry with a reporter's questions.
18785	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"Nothing could be further from the truth."

18787	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	and expensive technological efficiencies, like a fuel efficient heating system, account for the school's high cost, he said.
18788	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He noted repeatedly that the project is "exactly the same" as it was when it was conceived, approved, and voted on by aldermen and taxpayers several years ago.
18789	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing secretive about it," he said before cutting the interview short.
18790	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"They ((critics)) say there's not enough money and there's too much money.
18791	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	I've planned for contingencies."
18792	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His spokesman, Jeremy Solomon, followed up the same day in an e-mail saying the "mayor feels badly" about the interview and "understands his tone ... was not conducive to a productive interview."
18793	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Newton may be a small city of 80,000, but politicians frequently talk about residents' "expectation of excellence," especially when it comes to schools.
18794	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's plans for the new Newton North High were clearly designed to meet that standard.
18795	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	In 2002, he announced plans to renovate Newton North High School, but the $40 million renovation ballooned into a $109 million project to build a new "state of the art" high school after parents learned that students would need to be relocated during construction.
18796	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Aldermen and state officials urged Cohen to scale back the new plan, but he did not.
18797	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Instead, with the support of a majority of the aldermen, the city hired architect Graham Gund to design the building.
18798	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Since then, costs continued to soar.
18799	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Last year, when the city announced that the cost of the high school would rise to $147 million, Cohen sidestepped blame and left it to his chief administrative officer, Sanford M. Pooler, to inform aldermen about the new price tag.
18800	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The mayor's spokesman had said Cohen was on vacation at the time and unavailable to comment, yet a reporter spotted Cohen leaving City Hall 20 minutes before the announcement.
18801	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I don't think it's fair to jump to a conclusion that he had someone do his dirty work," Solomon said about Cohen, in reference to the incident.
18802	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has faced the Board of Aldermen on many, many occasions and not only to present good news."
18803	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Solomon said last night that he could not remember the circumstances of why the mayor may have left City Hall that day.
18804	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's coalition of support had already begun to crumble, undermined by the cost of the building, an unrelated fight with the city firefighters union, and increasingly feisty aldermen.
18805	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Ward 4 Alderwoman at Large Amy Mah Sangiolo, who took office the same year Cohen became mayor, said the mayor effectively used Solomon, his $97,000-a-year spokesman, to shield himself from critics and the media.
18806	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She said it was a big change from her early days in office when Cohen invited board members to meetings in his office, and she thought they shared many similar views on education (she supported the new school) and the environment.
18807	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She has since broken with Cohen.
18808	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He was elected to set the policy and vision of the city.
18809	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	What has his vision been?"
18810	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Sangiolo said.
18811	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"The whole emphasis has been on ((the high school)) and that it's going to be built no matter what."
18812	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's refusal to acknowledge critics' concerns has baffled even supporters.
18813	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Martina Jackson, cochairwoman of the Newton City Democratic Committee and a personal friend of 30 years, said Cohen is not a glad hander.
18814	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He can be "awkward socially" but funny, she said.
18815	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was a state legislator, he called her to pose this Woody Allen-esque question: If police arrested Marcel Marceau, would officers have to mime him his Miranda rights?
18816	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Some say the writing is on the wall.
18817	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen did not hold his annual fund-raiser this year, and gave his campaign manager permission to get rid of his lawn signs.
18818	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"In our opinion, it's clear he does not intend to run again," said Christopher Hill of Move Newton Forward, the pro-override group.
18819	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen surely hopes his legacy will be Newton North High School.
18820	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	But that legacy will undoubtedly be colored by the pay raise proposal.
18821	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Brooke Lipsitt, a former president of the Board of Aldermen and a Cohen supporter, said it's clear the mayor's unpopularity will cost the override votes on May 20.
18822	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I'm sorry about that," she said.
18823	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"And I'm sure he is, too."
18824	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	ANOTHER DISTURBING ROADBLOCKTHIS ROADBLOCK IS DISTURBING
18825	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	CLEVELAND - They were kings of the road.
18826	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are road kill.
18827	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And it's giving their fans road rage.
18828	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Celtics fans figured this was the night the team would revert to their green jersey dominance of the regular season.
18829	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Hub hoop junkies witnessed the ease of a Game 2 victory at TD Banknorth Garden and concluded that the real Celtics were ready to take it to the streets of Cleveland.
18830	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No more of the nonsense that plagued them for three long nights in Atlanta.
18831	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And then the game started and Boston's swagger and superiority evaporated.
18832	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Again.
18833	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics didn't show up.
18834	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got run out of the gym, 108-84, last night by the same team that couldn't score 75 points in the New Garden.
18835	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
18836	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It wasn't about LeBron James this time.
18837	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The King carried his shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor).
18838	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it didn't matter because the Cavaliers ran away from the Celtics long before halftime.
18839	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the second.
18840	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics never got closer than 12 after intermission.
18841	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Boston's no-show included taking only two free throws in the first half, which ended with the Cavaliers leading, 52-35.
18842	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Paul Pierce took eight shots all night.
18843	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Ray Allen shot 4 for 12.
18844	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Point guard Rajon Rondo had zero assists in 23 minutes.
18845	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland has the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier attitude.
18846	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers.
18847	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"I thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the game.
18848	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	In every way they beat us tonight.
18849	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They outcoached us, they played harder, they got the loose balls.
18850	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We were not comfortable.
18851	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We didn't make plays.
18852	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Instead of being the solid defensive team that we've been, I thought we got down because our offense wasn't going."
18853	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This makes the Green 6-0 at home and 0-4 on the road in this postseason.
18854	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Though it is technically possible for the Celtics to win the championship if this continues, the hot-cold, home-away dynamic does little to inspire confidence.
18855	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This caliber of play is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or Hornets.
18856	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So the same questions will be asked before the Celtics play Game 4 here tomorrow night.
18857	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The questions will be asked again and again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.
18858	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Strange.
18859	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road this season.
18860	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They swept through Texas, which is virtually impossible in today's NBA.
18861	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And now they are neutralized and intimidated by the likes of Philips Arena and Quicken Loans Arena.
18862	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	What gives?
18863	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"This is the NBA," said Rivers.
18864	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Nothing surprises me in this league.
18865	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Did I think this would happen?
18866	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No.
18867	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it did happen.
18868	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So now we just have to get ready for Monday night."
18869	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Asked to account for the home-road disparity, Rivers said, "I can't.
18870	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But we have to find out why."
18871	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We definitely took our lumps tonight," admitted Pierce.
18872	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We're going to come out better in Game 4.
18873	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to come out to a better start."
18874	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When Pierce was asked if he was worried, he said, "A little bit.
18875	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I'm disappointed.
18876	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be a lot more aggressive.
18877	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be aggressive on the road."
18878	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This was never a game.
18879	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland's Ben Wallace recovered from his Game 2 vapors and made his first three shots as the Cavaliers bolted to a 22-8 lead.
18880	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	That's a 14-point lead.
18881	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I know this only because the overhead scoreboard at The Q offers a moronic feature entitled "The Diff."
18882	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When it was 22-8, The Diff was 14.
18883	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Thanks.
18884	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	(Wonder if there are any hockey or soccer scoreboards that offer The Diff?)
18885	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics were hoping to avoid.
18886	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We've got to come out in the first quarter and put up a better fight," said Celtics guard Sam Cassell.
18887	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We refused to play together offensively," said Rivers.
18888	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"And that's the thing that alarms me from Atlanta.
18889	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got a lot of the offensive rebounds.
18890	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But that's hustle.
18891	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We have to do better."
18892	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	There is cause for concern.
18893	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This is a little more than a home- road thing.
18894	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It feels like the Celtics are being exposed.
18895	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Pierce and Allen have not been the same players they were during the regular season.
18896	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Rondo looks lost.
18897	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The team that won 66 games hasn't demonstrated the fortitude of a champion.
18898	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They lost only 16 games during the regular season, never by as many as 20.
18899	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are 0-4 on the road in the playoffs and smarting from a 24-point beating.
18900	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for somebody to step forward.
18901	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for the Celtics to show up in a game played outside the Garden.

18910	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	FACED WITH ELIMINATION, FLYERS AND THEIR FANS SHOW SOME LIFE
18911	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	PHILADELPHIA
18912	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	His white helmet knocked askew, Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby slowly skidded on his back toward the Philadelphia Flyers' goal, picking up snow on the seat of his pants.
18913	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	He, and his team, did not look so invincible Thursday.
18914	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Facing elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers rediscovered the ferocity they had displayed in the first two rounds, scoring three first-period goals and then holding off Pittsburgh, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 19,972 at Wachovia Center.
18915	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the difference," Crosby said.
18916	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	After scoring one goal on nine power-play chances in the first three games of the series, all won by the Penguins, Philadelphia scored two power-play goals and avoided being swept from the Eastern Conference finals.
18917	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Game 5 is scheduled for Sunday in Pittsburgh.
18918	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Philadelphia goaltender Martin Biron stopped 36 of 38 shots against the Penguins, who had won 11 of their first 12 playoff games.
18919	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Jordan Staal scored Pittsburgh's goals in the third period, his second score coming with 5 minutes 49 seconds remaining.
18920	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to seal the victory.
18921	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	It was the second goal of the game for Lupul.
18922	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
18923	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval, the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
18924	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh penalty box.
18925	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' other elite center.
18926	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Stevens juggled his line combinations, placing Richards on his stagnant top line, which includes Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell.
18927	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Vinny Prospal centered a line with R.J. Umberger and Lupul.
18928	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere said he and Richards had chemistry on the power play throughout the year.
18929	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I thought, wow, maybe that could work five-on-five," Briere said.
18930	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"So I was excited and enthusiastic about the idea."
18931	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Thirty seconds after a tripping penalty on Briere ended early in the first period, Lupul stormed into the Penguins' zone and took a slap shot at goaltender Marc-Andr?
18932	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury before he reached the face-off circle.
18933	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh defenseman Hal Gill.
18934	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury flinched his left shoulder to try to stop the shot, but the puck went in 8:27 into the first.
18935	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The crowd howled when Briere, pounded by the Penguins in the series, was tripped by defenseman Sergei Gonchar, and Gonchar was called for a penalty.
18936	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers scored on the power play, when Briere swept in the rebound of a slap shot by defenseman Randy Jones at 11:48.

19006	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	PARIS
19007	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	They're clunky, heavy and ugly, but they have become modish -- and they are not this season's platform shoes.
19008	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A year after the introduction of the sturdy gray bicycles known as Velib's, they are being used all over Paris.
19009	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The bikes are cheap to rent because they are subsidized by advertising, and other major cities, including American ones, are exploring similar projects.
19010	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	About 20,600 Velib' bicycles are in service here, with more than 1,450 self-service rental stations.
19011	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The stations are only some 300 yards apart, and there are four times as many as there are subway stations, even in a city so well served by its metro system.
19012	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	In the first year, the city says, there have been 27.5 million trips in this city of roughly 2.1 million people, many of them for daily commutes.
19013	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	On average, there are 120,000 trips a day.
19014	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	And on July 27, at the conclusion here of the Tour de France, 365 lucky Velib' riders will be chosen to ride along for a while and cross the finish line.
19015	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	There are a Velib' Web site, Velib' fashions and a Velib' blog (www.blog.velib.paris.fr/blog)

19017	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A kind of Velib' behavior has emerged, especially at the morning rush, with people swiftly checking for bikes in the best condition: tires inflated, chains still attached, baskets unstolen.
19018	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	Natallya Ghyssaert, a 34-year-old doctor, has an annual subscription for 29 euros (about $46), which lets her use a bike whenever she wants for 30 minutes at a time without extra charges.
19019	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	She uses a Velib' two or three times a day, saying, "I love it
19020	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	you can see Paris, you can exercise and stay out in the light of day."
19021	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The Velib' -- a contraction of velo for bike and liberte -- can also be rented for a day or for a week, with a 150 euro (about $239) deposit taken from the user's credit card if the bike is not returned.
19022	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	Usage fees over 30 minutes can rise steeply: Two hours cost 7 euros (about $11).
19023	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	But 96 percent of all rides are less than 30 minutes, because bikes can be returned to any station.
19024	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	No one knows quite how many trips by car or taxi are thereby avoided, but the "eco-friendly" nature of the Velib' has been much promoted in a country where juice companies warn of the risks to "our fragile planet" in lavish brochures on thick paper.

19028	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK - The word "courage" gets tossed around a lot in sports, often in reference to a player who makes an important shot or sinks a winning putt.
19029	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	We gained a new appreciation for the term when we visited the Sports Museum of America and read about Aja Frary.
19030	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	When she was 15, her stepfather tried to force her to give up sports.
19031	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Frary refused and left home, moving in with her grandparents.
19032	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	She went on to star in three sports at Seattle's Evergreen High and earned a college scholarship, eventually becoming one of the top track athletes in the country.
19033	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	We also learned about a dad in California who questioned his daughter's team being booted off a field so a boys' squad could practice, and found that local facilities for girls were sorely lacking.
19034	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	His documenting of the inequity forced the school district to balance access to playing fields.
19035	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"You come away from a visit to the museum more impressed with the people you didn't know about than those you did know," said Jim Craig of Easton, goaltender for the 1980 US Olympic "Miracle on Ice" hockey team.
19036	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Craig, 51, an honorary trustee, helped usher the museum into its historic space in the Financial District two months ago.
19037	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	He also loaned the museum the flag that someone draped over him in the tumult after the US team captured the gold medal against the Soviets.
19038	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The resulting photo is one of sports' iconic images.
19039	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Certainly this museum is more than a repository of artifacts, although it can claim some dandies: college football's Heisman Trophy, for which it is the new permanent home

19047	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Some people would minimize sports' role in our culture," said Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder.
19048	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"But my goal, going back 6?
19049	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	years now, is to show the power of sports to impact lives."
19050	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb's life changed in a matter of 24 hours, when he visited the Basketball Hall of Fame for the first time on Sept. 10, 2001 (his 39th birthday), and lamented the absence of an all-sports museum in the United States.
19051	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The attacks the next day spurred him to pursue his goal of a museum that would celebrate all sports, and to build it in Manhattan.
19052	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Sixteen months later, the Basketball Hall of Fame became the first partner.
19053	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb speaks warmly of the first athlete to join the advisory board, Celtics legend Bob Cousy.
19054	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We call Bob our patron saint," said Schwalb.
19055	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Cousy, a New York native, was also the subject of a rallying cry when the fledgling museum was trying to gain its footing.
19056	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The mayor had given us the use of Gracie Mansion for a meeting with the deputy mayor for economic development, and we wanted noteworthy athletes to join us," said Schwalb.
19057	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We had four or five lined up, but as time went on the others kept canceling.
19058	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Finally, only Cousy was left, so our slogan was 'Don't lose the Cooz."'
19059	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Another Hall of Famer, Bill Bradley, steered the project toward Lower Manhattan, which resulted in Schwalb's group securing Liberty bonds, part of a federal initiative to revitalize the area.
19060	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a dozen or so businesses out of some 300 applicants won approval, and that landed the museum $60 million of its required $100 million.
19061	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"When I was a kid in Orlando, playing ball in the driveway, I would pretend I was Bill Bradley," said Schwalb of the onetime New York Knick.
19062	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Imagine coming home one day to find a voice mail from him about our project."
19063	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The 19 galleries brim with the top players in the leading sports.
19064	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb worked to align the museum with every important governing body and hall of fame, and he landed the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., just a month before opening.
19065	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	What did those organizations have to gain?
19066	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	As in many sports stories, the statistics are telling.
19067	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"In the case of the Basketball Hall of Fame, they work hard, they hold special events, and they get just over 100,000 visitors a year," says Schwalb.
19068	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"There must be what, 30 million basketball fans in this country?
19069	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	And a lot of them don't even know the Hall of Fame is in Springfield."
19070	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb estimates that an annual 7 million visitors make their way to Battery Park and its ferries to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
19071	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum is about 50 yards from the park, right across the street from the famous "charging bull" statue symbolic of Wall Street, a couple of blocks from Ground Zero, and at the starting point for ticker-tape parades down Broadway, the mile-long "Canyon of Heroes" leading to City Hall.
19072	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Dozens of sidewalk medallions commemorate the early parades, such as the salute to Charles Lindbergh in 1927, and Schwalb considers it great karma that the lone two markers for sports parades (golfer Bobby Jones and swimmer Gertrude Ederle) are both in front of the museum.
19073	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We also have a photo of Jesse Owens in a convertible during his parade in 1936 that was taken directly in front of our building," said Schwalb.
19074	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum sits at 26 Broadway and boasts a commanding presence in the historic former headquarters of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co.
19075	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The building is unlike any other we could find," said Schwalb.
19076	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Its facade is 450 feet long, and you'd be hard-pressed to find another building of that length in New York City."
19077	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The biggest win-win among sports organizations has to be the partnership with the Women's Sports Foundation, which was without a permanent home before it christened the Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center as part of the museum.
19078	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"They were determined to have a physical space for their hall of fame," said Schwalb.
19079	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"For 20 years they would have an induction dinner, and they never had a place to honor the inductees."
19080	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum provides several interactive touches: Fans can lend the announcer's voice to some classic moments, get behind a hockey goalie's mask and see a forward bearing down on them with the puck, gauge their cycling ability, even take a shot at changing the tires like a member of a pit crew.
19081	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	At the final kiosk, visitors can learn more about how to visit the various halls of fame and get on their e-mail lists.
19082	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's better than a single hall of fame and more than a museum," said Craig.
19083	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"I call it a destination for dreams."

19091	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
19092	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- He was an hour outside of London when the bell began to toll.
19093	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Arthur Blank was flying home from a Kenyan safari on his private plane, scheduled to land in England to refuel, when the pilot left the cockpit, a sheaf of paper in his hand.
19094	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"You need to see this," the pilot said.
19095	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
19096	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The date was July 17, 2007.
19097	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The football team on which Blank had lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as completely as any football team ever has.
19098	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season that never ended.
19099	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Every day there was another twist to the story - there was the Michael Vick story, and then there was the Bobby Petrino story.
19100	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was like someone kept adding another stick of wood to the fire."
19101	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Then, after a pause: "But fires do burn out."
19102	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	This fire, alas, had a wickedly long tail.
19103	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Within five months, Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the quarterback's singular skills.
19104	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the field," the work carries no guarantee.
19105	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
19106	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
19107	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"Clearly the answer we felt was, 'Yes.'
19108	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But whether he would have proved he could play at a very high level - a consistent level - we'll never know."
19109	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
19110	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
19111	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.
19112	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6?
19113	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would the grumbling about Petrino's methods have been silenced?
19114	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It's possible, but to be frank, the issues Bobby had with the players and communication started from the very beginning.
19115	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The players from the get-go felt disconnected.
19116	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We would have had to win a lot of games for (pacification) to take place."
19117	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	For the owner, what was the nadir of the season without end?
19118	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Receiving the indictment?
19119	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Seeing training camp begin with Vick in court in Richmond, Va., and PETA protestors outside the gates at Flowery Branch?
19120	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Watching Vick address the media after pleading guilty?
19121	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Having Petrino bolt the day after Vick was sentenced to 23 months in jail?
19122	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It was the day (Aug. 24) we received the document," says Blank, referring to Vick's pre-plea statement of facts.
19123	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"A lot had been speculation up to then.
19124	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... Even after the indictment, Michael was still saying, 'I'm innocent
19125	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	you'll find that out.'
19126	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The reality was that what Michael had been saying was not true.
19127	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was difficult when Bobby left, but I didn't have a six-year relationship with him."
19128	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom Brady)?
19129	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What about Indianapolis (with Peyton Manning)?
19130	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	With Michael, as spectacular as he was - not always great - with that kind of exciting player, he becomes in many ways the face of the franchise."
19131	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The former face of the Falcons sits in a Kansas prison.
19132	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	A radically different team - new quarterback, new coach, new general manager - will open training camp next week.
19133	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of his reconfigured club, Blank says, "I have tremendous expectations this team will play hard and play well.
19134	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... There'll be a lot of energy, a lot of discipline.
19135	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We'll surprise a lot of people."
19136	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Already the summer has yielded one bit of cheer.
19137	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The 2008 Blank family vacation passed without untoward interruption.
19138	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"We went to Italy for 10 days," he says.
19139	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"We didn't get any pieces of paper over there."

19142	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	FOR MANY, EMERGENCY VISIT ENDS IN DISCONNECT
19143	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The vast majority of patients don't fully understand the instructions they receive from doctors when they leave the emergency department, according to a new report.
19144	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Further, the vast majority of those patients weren't aware that they didn't understand.
19145	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at two hospitals in southeastern Michigan.
19146	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers asked patients to recall what their doctors told them about their diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency department care, and return instructions.
19147	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers then compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked whether the patients thought they had fully understood the instructions.
19148	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do when they left the hospital.
19149	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	That is "at minimal, distressing," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, the study's lead author and a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
19150	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If there's one aspect of a patient's care and instructions that I would hope they'd leave the emergency department with, it's ... what they should be doing when they get home.
19151	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This means that those people are likely to have difficulty following the directions," Engel said.
19152	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	It's a problem Dr. Richard Wolfe, chief of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is familiar with - but he said the article gave doctors their first hard data.
19153	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
19154	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do when they get home.
19155	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.
19156	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five - of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem," she said.
19157	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"They won't even say ((their comprehension is)) only very good - they'll say it's excellent."
19158	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	While the study's design is sound, its small size and limited area - two hospitals within 15 minutes of each other - makes it hard to generalize to patients throughout the country, said Dr. Richard Bachur, chief of emergency services at Children's Hospital Boston.
19159	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said.
19160	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	But because of its size, "it's almost like a pilot study."
19161	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that patients were given handwritten discharge notes, instead of the printed, bullet-point style fact sheets that have become standard, he said, was also problematic.
19162	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Still, the study exposes a vulnerability in a field that is constantly stretched because of pressure to see patients rapidly, he said.
19163	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Whatever strategy people develop for a discharge procedure should be sure it includes real-time communication and an opportunity to ask questions," Bachur said, particularly in emergency departments.
19164	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"That could make some of the concerns in this article obsolete."
19165	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Tips for emergency department patients
19166	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Always ask for printed discharge information - and be certain you understand what it says.
19167	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Making sure you really get what you're supposed to do when you go home is important," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
19168	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Bring a friend or family member.
19169	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Patients are sick, they're anxious, tired, frustrated," Engel said.
19170	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to absorb information when you're like that."
19171	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Understand that healthcare providers are there to help you, and that you can trust them.
19172	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The issue of trust between patient and physician ... has eroded over time," said Dr. Richard Wolfe, chief of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
19173	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"And that's really where the whole secret to successful medical care lies."
19174	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Ask questions.
19175	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If you don't know or are uncomfortable, ask or tell," Wolfe said.
19176	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"There's no symptom or issue that's too small to communicate - it's more the unanswered questions that can create problems."
19177	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Get your provider's name and phone number in case you have any follow-up questions.
19178	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Pick up any documentation related to your care and read it thoroughly.

19208	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	We are a group of 14 who are visiting Ireland in August for 10 days.
19209	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	We will land in Dublin.
19210	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	I have heard the most beautiful area is Kerry.
19211	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	Can you help me in suggesting an itinerary?

19214	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	You won't find much consensus on what's the most beautiful area of Ireland, though Killarney National Park, the Dingle Peninsula and the Ring of Kerry -- all in County Kerry -- have their passionate advocates.
19215	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	To avoid a day or two of driving from Dublin, you will want to catch a connecting flight from there to Kerry Airport (www.kerryairport.com), near Killarney, a route served by the low-cost carrier Ryanair as of July 1.
19216	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	Spend a night or two in the pretty little town of Killarney.

19219	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	The next day take the curvy road through Killarney National Park, which abuts the town.
19220	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	There you'll find waterfalls, photo-worthy views, gardens and great hiking trails.
19221	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	The next two or three days you can drive the Ring of Kerry, a route of more than 100 miles of natural beauty and small towns along the outer edge of Iveragh Peninsula.
19222	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	From Portmagee, about mid-Ring, you can make a day trip out to the small and rugged Skellig Islands.
19223	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	The Dingle Peninsula is a shorter drive, but no less beautiful.
19224	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	The town of Tralee is a good place to spend an evening before or after the Dingle loop

19230	NYT_ENG_20080727.0036.LDC2009T13	If you have a few days left, you could drive north to County Clare, home of the stunning Cliffs of Moher and the rugged landscape of the Burren, and continue on to the port town of Galway.

19235	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	CANDIDATES REACT TO CONFLICT IN GEORGIA
19236	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	LAS VEGAS
19237	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	When Russian troops rolled into South Ossetia on Friday, Sen. John McCain's response was immediate and tough.
19238	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Russia had crossed "an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia," and should "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces," said McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in a hastily arranged statement delivered on an airport tarmac.
19239	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, trod more carefully, which was characteristic of his approach to foreign affairs.
19240	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He did not directly blame Russia and instead offered a more measured response, focused on negotiations, which largely echoed the official comments of the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and even President Bush.
19241	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war," Obama said in a statement issued by his campaign.
19242	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Although the statement added that "Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected," it concluded that "all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in Georgia."
19243	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Although Obama did harden his rhetoric shortly before boarding a plane for a vacation to Hawaii later on Friday -- he said that "what is clear is that Russia has encroached on Georgia's sovereignty" -- he remained far less confrontational than McCain.
19244	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama might respond to a crisis with international implications.
19245	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The fighting, which began when Georgian forces tried to retake the capital of South Ossetia from insurgents in the pro-Russian region of the Caucasus, was developing into the worst clash since Russian troops invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s.
19246	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	McCain spoke to two crucial people on Friday before making his statement: President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, whom he has known since 1997, and Steven J. Hadley, the White House national security adviser.
19247	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has been criticized for cracking down on demonstrators last year, but McCain has been a loyal and longtime ally.
19248	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	McCain first heard about the crisis shortly before leaving Cincinnati for Des Moines on Friday morning, and to gather more information he made phone calls from his car on the way to the airport.
19249	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	To prepare a statement, he then relied on his foreign policy staff, including Randy Scheunemann, his chief foreign policy aide, whose firm has lobbied for Georgia for the past four years.
19250	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Scheunemann, who has worked for McCain's campaign since early 2007, took a leave from his firm, Orion Strategies LLC, in March of this year.
19251	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of the statement.
19252	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He delivered it on the tarmac upon landing in Des Moines.
19253	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama's response came in several stages.
19254	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The campaign said its initial statement was made before being able to confirm that Russia had invaded Georgian territory, and so it was cautious about assigning blame.
19255	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama was more judgmental in his own statement later on Friday, and by Saturday his campaign stepped up the rhetoric once again.
19256	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Clearly over the course of the last 24 hours this crisis has escalated," said Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy aide.
19257	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Clearly Russia bears the responsibility for that escalation."
19258	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Aides said Obama was also briefed by Hadley on Friday and was kept informed on developments by his foreign policy advisers as he flew to Hawaii.
19259	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Wendy Morigi, Obama's national security spokeswoman, said that in recent days the campaign had spoken to experts including Sam Nunn, a former senator of Georgia and an influential Democratic voice on foreign policy
19260	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Michael A. McFaul, a Russia scholar at Stanford University who heads the campaign's foreign policy team on Russia and Eurasia
19261	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Richard Holbrooke, a former American ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton
19262	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	and Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic representative of Indiana, who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center.
19263	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Both campaigns also used the crisis to engage in their now-daily political combat, which in this round focused on Scheunemann and his ties to Georgia.
19264	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for, and has a vested interest in, the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government," said Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, who added that the "appearance of a conflict of interest" was a consequence of McCain's close ties to lobbyists.
19265	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter, of the McCain campaign, dismissed the criticism.
19266	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"In the middle of an international crisis, in which people are getting killed, the best the Obama campaign can come up with is to cast aspersions on a McCain staffer," he said.
19267	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter acknowledged that Scheunemann had lobbied for Georgia, but said that McCain "has been involved in the efforts of former Soviet Republics to embrace democracy and free-market values since the end of the Cold War."
19268	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	KURDS ASSERT CONTROL OVER KIRKUK
19269	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	KIRKUK, Iraq
19270	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
19271	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
19272	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	No, Najat told the caller.
19273	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after hanging up, he wryly revealed the deeper truth about Kirkuk, combustible for its mix of ethnicities floating together on a sea of oil: The Kurds already control it.
19274	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It's true," Najat said.
19275	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
19276	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Of all the political problems facing Iraq today, perhaps none is so intractable as the fate of Kirkuk, a city of 900,000 that Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens all claim as their own.
19277	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The explosive quarrel over the city is one major barrier to creating stable political structures in the rest of Iraq.
19278	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Beyond that, it demonstrates that despite a recent decline in violence, Iraq's unsettled ethnic and regional discord could still upend directives emanating from Baghdad and destabilize large regions of the country -- or even set off a civil war.
19279	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	This month, legislation in the national parliament to set the groundwork for crucial provincial elections collapsed in a bitter dispute over Kirkuk, as Arabs and Turkmens demanded that the Kurds be forced to cede some of their power here.
19280	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But with the Kurds having already consolidated their authority in Kirkuk, there seemed little chance -- short of a military intervention -- of that happening.
19281	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city.
19282	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In addition to the provincial government and command of the police, the Kurds control the Asaish, the feared undercover security service that works with the U.S. military and, according to Asaish commanders, U.S. intelligence agencies.
19283	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the best intelligence.
19284	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
19285	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"He's my boss," said Najat, the commander of the KDP Asaish force in Kirkuk, glancing at a picture of Masrur Barzani, the head of intelligence for the KDP and the son of the party's leader, Massoud Barzani.
19286	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago, rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
19287	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the attack, a mob of Kurds set upon a Turkmen political headquarters, eventually firebombing the building.
19288	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	At some point, the Turkmen guards inside fired at the crowd.
19289	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All in all, U.S. officials say they believe, far more people were killed and wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
19290	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
19291	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One of the Turkmen guards wounded in the fighting was quickly interrogated at the hospital by the Asaish and the police.
19292	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.
19293	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish police commanders promise an impartial investigation of the bombing and its aftermath, overseen by officers from all of the city's ethnic groups.
19294	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But the senior Turkmen on the force, Maj. Gen. Turhan Abdul-Rahman Youssef, fears a whitewash.
19295	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I don't think we will have a result," he said, describing the broadcast showing the wounded Turkmen guard as "illegal."
19296	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs and Turkmens.
19297	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"There is much fear," said Mohammed Khalil, the leader of the Arab bloc on the provincial council.
19298	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"The Asaish are saying they will annex Kirkuk by force, and that is terrifying people."
19299	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
19300	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an outbreak of ethnic fighting.
19301	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The city's Arabs, said Khalil, "will not stay handcuffed by Kurdish actions."
19302	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Kurdish families were driven out of Kirkuk, replaced by Arabs as part of his drive to obtain a firmer political grip on the enormous oil reserves here.
19303	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing in Kurds.
19304	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
19305	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan region.
19306	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	They also warn that any plan involuntarily stripping them of power will be harshly contested.
19307	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Its fate will be failure," said Nejad Hassan, the senior KDP official in Kirkuk.
19308	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the suicide bombing, that conflict was evident in a dispute about whether to bring a substantial number of Iraqi troops into the city, in a direct challenge to Kurdish supremacy.
19309	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a series of sweeps conducted with the Americans, the Iraqi army has helped establish stability this year in other volatile parts of Iraq.
19310	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But Iraqi troops have largely stayed out of Kirkuk.
19311	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the July 28 attacks, however, Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki ordered in a battalion from a nearby base.
19312	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The troops took up positions in the city.
19313	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
19314	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major Arab security force after the July 28 violence.
19315	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military commander here, Col. David Paschal, said he feared that if Baghdad sent in additional troops, Kurdish leaders would retaliate by sending in their own militia from northern Iraq, creating a potentially disastrous confrontation.
19316	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I just saw this continued escalation of force happening," he said.
19317	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Baghdad is expected to withdraw the troops, according to U.S. commanders.
19318	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said he blames all the political parties for inflaming tensions to serve their interests.
19319	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.
19320	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Negotiations here are, 'You give me everything I want, and I will walk away happy,"' he said.
19321	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred."
19322	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
19323	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic, a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be seen standing in a sea of demonstrators.
19324	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	He ritualistically raises his hands, palms up, toward his face, then lowers them to his side.
19325	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	An instant later the explosion engulfs him and everyone around him.
19326	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed.
19327	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One mistook a well-known Kurdish journalist, Yahya Barzanji, for a Turkmen correspondent, shouting, "He's working for the Turkmens," Barzanji recalled.
19328	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video captured the crowd furiously beating Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him!
19329	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kill him!"
19330	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Within minutes the mob was in front of the Turkmen party headquarters.
19331	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	While U.S. and Kurdish officials agree that the Turkmen guards fired into the crowd, Paschal -- who watched the skirmish unfold in a video feed from a remotely piloted aerial drone -- said that the Turkmens did not appear to fire wantonly, and that they instead gradually escalated until they were firing directly into a large and growing mob that posed a threat.
19332	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.
19333	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authorities have sought to play down the intensity of the fight between the Kurds and the Turkmens, but Paschal said most of the casualties were sustained during the riot.
19334	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since last summer.
19335	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds attribute some of that improvement to the Asaish.
19336	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are in direct contact with the people," said Hemin Shafiq, a 24-year-old policeman.
19337	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are more rapid.
19338	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	That is why they are much more active than the police."
19339	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Rifat Abdullah, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan here, said: "The Asaish have lots of sources, and that's why the Americans depend on them and the police depend on them.
19340	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	That might explain why they have more power."
19341	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Turhan admitted that the Asaish officers were, at times, more powerful than the police, and he said there were thousands of Asaish in the city, though Kurdish officials say there are no more than 1,000.
19342	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They have a major role combating terrorism, but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties," he said.
19343	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In an interview, the provincial police chief, Maj. Gen. Jamal Taher, a Kurd, did not answer a question about whether he had the power to control the activities of the Asaish.
19344	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he praised their ability to ferret out information.
19345	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Maybe they have better sources than me," he said.
19346	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	BOTTLING PLAN PUSHES GROUNDWATER TO CENTER STAGE IN VERMONT
19347	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	EAST MONTPELIER, Vt.
19348	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of gallons of groundwater flow to the surface in rivulets here each hour, helping to create this town's signature spring, a lush current typical of northern New England.
19349	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Just uphill, a meadow stretches to the doorstep of Daniel Antonovich, a businessman with plans to bottle and sell about 250,000 gallons a day from the spring.
19350	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The idea makes his neighbors nervous.
19351	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Like two-thirds of Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of East Montpelier depend on wells.
19352	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Some worry that a water-bottling operation will compromise their ability to shower and flush
19353	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	others just do not want their local water sold elsewhere.
19354	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In corners of the state, once-reliable well-water supplies have become intermittent in recent years, with homeowners blaming local developers or mining operations or a bottling operation.
19355	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In March, the town of East Montpelier postponed any bottling for three years.
19356	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in the company of a growing number of states, the legislature adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust.
19357	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Beginning in 2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
19358	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter than Vermont this summer).
19359	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In recent years, eastern aquifers have been drawn down in areas around Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as Atlanta.
19360	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in northern Vermont, last summer during a drought.
19361	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Water is the resource of the 21st century," said Laurence R. Becker, Vermont's state geologist.
19362	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The amount of water that we use will increase and we will be looking for fresh water in many places."
19363	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	With the growing recognition that groundwater is not limitless, more states and localities are looking for ways to protect it.
19364	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Hampshire are at the forefront of this trend, and Vermont is now making its move.
19365	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The concerns of East Montpelier residents are reflected in the Great Lakes Resources compact, a broad water-management agreement already approved by the U.S. Senate and by eight Midwestern states and two Canadian provinces.
19366	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed in an era of abundance," said Andy Buchsbaum,director of the Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation.
19367	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"They were not designed to address shortages."
19368	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Ginny Lyons, a Democratic state senator in Vermont, believes that, given the possibility of a future in which water supplies may be constrained, "We've been doing things in an irrational way.
19369	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	We make the assumption that just because you get so many gallons out of a well now, you will forever."
19370	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	She and state Sen. Diane Snelling, a Republican, responding to groundwater debates from Williston, a suburb of Burlington, (where neighbors fought over well water) to the town of Danby (where local residents opposed a mining operation), this year succeeded, by a large margin, in winning adoption of the law declaring groundwater a commonly owned resource -- in legal parlance, a public trust.
19371	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
19372	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.
19373	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Though Vermont is a relative latecomer in adopting the public trust status for groundwater, Maude Barlow, a Canadian crusader against bottled water and the author of "Blue Covenant: The Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to Water," argues that its new law, more than most, anticipates the day when people's thirst for ground water outstrips supplies.
19374	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It's no longer an under-the-radar issue," said Jon Groveman, the general counsel of the Vermont Natural Resources Council.
19375	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected."
19376	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In the past decade, commercial and industrial users, including golf courses, mining operations and, most notably, water bottlers, have faced increasing local opposition in damp regions from Maine to Wisconsin.
19377	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Andrew W. MacLean, a lobbyist in Montpelier who represents industries affected by the legislation, said he believed the law duplicated existing requirements, but did not want to oppose it.
19378	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There was a recognition by people that something was going to pass," he said.
19379	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The desire by the business community was to play an active role and shape it as we were able."
19380	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Early opponents, like farmers, mostly stayed on the sidelines when their water uses were grandfathered under the law.
19381	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Surface water in streams, lakes and rivers, has been legally managed for hundreds of years.
19382	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	But groundwater, until recent years, was often treated as something separate, hydrologically and legally.
19383	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Both distinctions are now breaking down.
19384	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."
19385	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Replenishment from rain or surface water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
19386	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Extraction of ground water tends to alter natural flow patterns and speeds, the report said.
19387	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Becker, Vermont's state geologist, said that the state's groundwater travels along fractures in the rock, moving, in effect, down a twisting series of underground tubes.
19388	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Mapping a Vermont aquifer and measuring its contents is thus akin to tracing a Jackson Pollock painting -- there are numerous units, of irregular dimensions, to delineate.
19389	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	While some residents of East Montpelier worry that their wells may suffer if Antonovich's firm, Montpelier Springs Water Co., opens for business, Antonovich said that he has had the aquifer mapped and that there is more than enough water for all.
19390	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, he keeps cordial relations with those who oppose him, said Carolyn Shapiro, one of a group of Antonovich's neighbors who pushed for the moratorium.
19391	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the moratorium.
19392	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also typified the debate over the public-trust law.
19393	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Jon Groveman of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, one of the bill's architects, drew praise not only from its legislative sponsors but also from MacLean, who represented the golf course and bottled-water industries.
19394	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
19395	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It is a beginning," she said.
19396	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum said he believes that the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis, or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that the West is now," he said.
19397	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is no water and they're trying to apportion droplets.
19398	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	They're in the terrible position of trying to judge between needs that are all critical with not enough resources."
19399	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum added, "We have the chance to get ahead of it."
19400	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	CLAYTON MAKES IMPRESSION, BUT WAS IT IN TIME?
19401	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	TAMPA Even before Michael Clayton reintroduced himself to the end zone Saturday, the Bucs were fielding calls from other teams interested in trading for the enigmatic receiver.
19402	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	A change of scenery might be good for Clayton, who is in the final year of his contract.
19403	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	And certainly, the Bucs have a surplus of pass catchers.
19404	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	But it's unlikely any route Clayton runs this season will take him out of Tampa Bay.
19405	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"I'm interested in Clayton, too.
19406	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	I don't care who else is," coach Jon Gruden said Monday.
19407	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"We're going to keep our best players, and I'll leave it at that.
19408	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	We've had a real competitive camp, and Mike has done some good things.
19409	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	People call all the time about all kinds of things.
19410	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"I thought he played well.
19411	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	He showed what a physical perimeter player he is.
19412	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	He made a great catch on an inside route for a first down away from his body.
19413	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	The touchdown catch was a hell of a catch.
19414	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	He ran a great route.
19415	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	It was good."
19416	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	That's not to say the Bucs won't entertain trades, but at receiver they are dealing from strength.
19417	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	The Bucs have to cut five players to reach the 75-man limit today and must get down to 53 players by Saturday.
19418	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Joey Galloway, who missed all of training camp and all three preseason games with a groin strain, practiced at full speed for the first time Monday.
19419	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	For the blazing fast 36-year-old, that's saying something.
19420	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Gruden said Galloway could play in the preseason finale Thursday at Houston.
19421	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"He looked good today, and we're encouraged to have him back," Gruden said.
19422	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"He ran some good routes, showed good quickness in and out of his breaks and showed good speed down the field.
19423	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	So we were pleased to have him back.
19424	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see any limit on him whatsoever.
19425	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	We didn't go extremely long today given the fact that we played (Saturday) night, and we've got a number of players still a little banged up. "
19426	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Galloway had offseason shoulder surgery and has had no full contact.
19427	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	But the goal is to get him ready for the Sept. 7 opener at New Orleans.
19428	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's a guy who played 26 snaps cumulative last year in the preseason and I think 22 the year before," Gruden said.
19429	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"I kind of did the math on that.
19430	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	So, if you play him 12 plays in the game, is that really going to get him ready to play in the regular season?
19431	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	He's missed a lot of practice time.
19432	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	He missed all the preseason.
19433	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	The great thing is he is healthy, he looked great today.
19434	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm going to look at it as good news.
19435	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm going to try not to beat myself up with all the what-ifs."
19436	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Clayton said he has not focused on the multiple scenarios, either, though he did hear broadcaster Chris Myers say general manager Bruce Allen had been fielding calls from teams interested in trading for him.
19437	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"The best thing to do is to continue to play," Clayton said.
19438	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"If everybody continues to do the same thing and stay on the track we're on, it's positive for everybody.
19439	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	The guys that will be here will be here.
19440	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	The guys who will not, they're putting enough stuff on tape to be somewhere."
19441	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Galloway, Maurice Stovall, Ike Hilliard, Antonio Bryant and rookie Dexter Jackson would appear to be locks for the team.
19442	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	Add Clayton and you have six receivers on the roster, a big number.
19443	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	That list doesn't include Micheal Spurlock, Brian Clark or Paris Warren, to name a few.
19444	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"We have to figure out what we're going to do," Gruden said.

19455	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In Hasselbeck they trust Since stepping back in as the Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season, Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
19456	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Completing 61 percent of his passes.
19457	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record 3,966 yards last year.
19458	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
19459	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
19460	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
19461	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
19462	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
19463	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	From the time he arrived in a 2001 trade with the Green Bay Packers, Brett Favre's one-time backup has had a dickens of a time living up to expectations.
19464	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	First, and perhaps foremost, he was coach Mike Holmgren's handpicked passer to replace a couple of local quarterbacks--Jon Kitna, who was not re-signed after the 2000 season
19465	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	and Brock Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him the starter not once but twice in 2000.
19466	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the story of what his first season and a half were like.
19467	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
19468	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won).
19469	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
19470	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were the ineffective and sometimes downright inept efforts when Hasselbeck had to step in for an injured Dilfer in 2002.
19471	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
19472	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson said.
19473	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"He is our leader, and we all need to follow his lead."
19474	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
19475	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck's face and voice are seemingly everywhere.
19476	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In TV commercials for Reebok and Expedia.
19477	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In newspaper ads for Jones Soda.
19478	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In radio spots for Infiniti.
19479	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On a huge billboard, promoting the team's Web site, near the club's old headquarters in Kirkland.
19480	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On the covers of just about every preview magazine now gracing a newsstand near you.
19481	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
19482	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
19483	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
19484	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"But when I was positive he could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to go, it was actually one of our tough years."
19485	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, in fact, 2002.
19486	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
19487	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
19488	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Twice in the final five games, Hasselbeck gave new meaning to the West Coast offense by setting the franchise record for passing yards--first in San Francisco (427 yards) and then in the season finale in San Diego (449).
19489	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren said.
19490	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"And that's what happened."
19491	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.
19492	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NOT THE SEASON YANKEES MANAGER JOE GIRARDI EXPECTED
19493	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
19494	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Several months ago, manager Joe Girardi studied the Yankees' schedule and noticed that their final game at Yankee Stadium would be Sept. 21.
19495	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Girardi did not believe it would be the final time he would manage in the ballpark.
19496	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He expected the Yankees to make the playoffs in his first season, expected the Stadium to live into October in its last season.
19497	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But sometime soon, the Yankees will learn that they have been mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.
19498	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
19499	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
19500	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a miracle.
19501	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
19502	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
19503	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We expected more.
19504	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	For whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to where we thought we were going to get."
19505	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	As Girardi sifts through the damage of a year in which the Yankees have spent only two days in first place in the American League East, and none since April, he is more comfortable blaming himself than he is in openly dissecting how and why the team fizzled.
19506	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
19507	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.
19508	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said.
19509	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I feel that I should have been able to make us better.
19510	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't know how you can think any differently."
19511	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Jeter, the team's captain, said that Girardi made a smooth transition as Joe Torre's successor and did "a good job."
19512	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
19513	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
19514	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
19515	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from finishing in fourth place.
19516	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Hank Steinbrenner, the Yankees' co-chairman, has complimented Girardi, the uninspiring season has created questions about his performance.
19517	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage?
19518	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
19519	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?
19520	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	How does his intense approach influence his players?
19521	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
19522	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
19523	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You don't really know what it's like to be the manager of the New York Yankees until you go through it," he said.
19524	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'
19525	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
19526	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
19527	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
19528	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
19529	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest morsel of data.
19530	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
19531	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
19532	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.
19533	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I worry about the people who know me understanding why I did something."
19534	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for the YES Network.
19535	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism.
19536	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Torre overused some pitchers and did not trust others.
19537	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
19538	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins in 2006, needed to improve in other areas.
19539	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
19540	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
19541	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing to be positive, which obviously is what he's trying to do.
19542	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	It's another thing to also be honest about how you really feel and what's going on.
19543	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
19544	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
19545	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
19546	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said he was surprised at how dejected Girardi appeared after the Yankees' first defeat of the season.
19547	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Tony Pena, the first-base coach, said Girardi would meet with the coaches after games to try to solve problems.
19548	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We suffer," Pena said.
19549	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Everybody suffers.
19550	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We don't want to lose.
19551	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't think our players want to lose, either.
19552	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough road.
19553	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough year."
19554	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Few have had as tough a year as Cano, whose average has plummeted to .260 this season from .306 last year.
19555	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	His on-base percentage is a sickly .294.
19556	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Larry Bowa, a former third-base coach for the Yankees, said he motivated Cano by getting "in his face."
19557	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
19558	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	In a move that is more about next season than this season, Girardi removed Cano from Sunday's game for not hustling on a fielding play.
19559	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Andy Pettitte said Girardi held several team meetings in which he showed a fiery side, estimating that Girardi had challenged the Yankees as much as Torre ever did.
19560	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
19561	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
19562	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like beating a dead horse."
19563	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not specific.
19564	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
19565	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He added that this season's experiences could cause him to change, too.
19566	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi, like the Steinbrenners, said he did not consider a season triumphant unless it ended with a championship.
19567	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There are always "successful things" that happen across 162 games, he said, but how a team finishes is all that is relevant.
19568	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Did you get to where you thought that you should get?"
19569	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said.
19570	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"With this team, right now, the answer is no."
19571	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The final answer will undoubtedly be no.
19572	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The season will end in disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something Girardi had not envisioned.
19573	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Stadium will close earlier than Girardi expected.
19574	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	BLOOMBERG SAID TO BE READY TO SEEK THIRD TERM AS MAYOR JONATHAN P. HICKS CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
19575	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
19576	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In an act that promises to upend New York City's political world, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to announce on Thursday that he will seek a third term as mayor, according to four people who have been told of his plans.
19577	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from running for re-election.
19578	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
19579	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In his appearance on Thursday, Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm, will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- and its potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady hand and business experience.
19580	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
19581	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
19582	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the council.
19583	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	His staff is drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two.
19584	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But the measure would require voter approval for the change to become permanent, these people said.
19585	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk.
19586	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
19587	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996.
19588	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
19589	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"Democracy," he added, "is bigger than any one person."
19590	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
19591	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes.
19592	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call for abolishing term limits.
19593	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The New York Post and the New York Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
19594	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
19595	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
19596	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his spokesman did not return several e-mail messages and telephone calls.
19597	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
19598	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor," said the person who has advised the mayor in the past.
19599	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"It's not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it."
19600	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
19601	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
19602	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty, that they may not remain for a full third term.
19603	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
19604	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
19605	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
19606	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg took pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms, traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and appearing on "Meet the Press" to field questions about the financial crisis.
19607	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
19608	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"He has the confidence of the business community and the executive ability to run the city," said Steve Ross, the chief executive of Related Cos., a major developer in the city.
19609	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This is a good time for him to do this.
19610	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People are scared."
19611	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
19612	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
19613	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Now, he added, "I could support the idea of a third term."
19614	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in the New York Post.
19615	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	According to a timetable outlined by those who have been told of the mayor's plan, legislation calling for the extension would probably be introduced within the next few weeks to the council, which has already signaled its support for the change
19616	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term- limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two- thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- a third term.
19617	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
19618	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.
19619	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's change of heart is certain to cause chaos in the city's political class.
19620	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	For months, or even years, the 35 candidates scheduled to leave office next year have been raising millions of dollars and lining up support for their next campaigns, whether for the state Legislature in September, or races for mayor, comptroller and borough president in 2009.
19621	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But if the mayor succeeds in revising the law, all of those candidates can seek a third term in their current offices.
19622	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's plan would have an especially deep impact on the next mayor's race.
19623	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Two candidates for mayor next year, Thompson, the comptroller, and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, would be forced from office under term limits.
19624	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
19625	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
19626	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"While Mike Bloomberg will undoubtedly have some opposition -- there will be somebody -- I expect him to be overwhelming re-elected."
19627	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through a spokesman that "It's illegal to run for a third term."
19628	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
19629	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be used against him in the next mayoral campaign.
19630	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"The mayor has carefully crafted an image of always acting in the public interest, but this act of circumventing the will of the voters now calls that into question," said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group.

19636	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	September was an especially grim month for suppliers, with companies announcing plans to shutter at least 12 plants and eliminate thousands more jobs.

19642	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Some Michigan elections officials are taking the warning to heart and are beefing up preparations for Nov. 4.
19643	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Detroit is hiring security guards for polling sites.
19644	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Others are staffing up significantly from what they usually do.
19645	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Farmington Hills clerk, for example, is tripling the number of voting stations and doubling poll workers that day.
19646	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	And she's trying to deputize some residents and send them to college campuses to allow Farmington Hills residents, who are on campus at Michigan colleges, to meet the requirement that they vote in person for the first time.
19647	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	We talk to other clerks about what they expect and how they plan to accommodate what might be a record turnout.
19648	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Because of the contested Democratic primary in January, Michigan was spared the crush of primary voters that swamped some states.
19649	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	But it was a learning experience for the others that we missed.

19652	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	And getting people to vote is very different from getting them registered.

19656	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	Reducing his footprint further still, Dr. Death has gone green, having recently purchased an electric car.
19657	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	His reason for the green car is not so much to save the human race, he says, since he has little regard for the human race.
19658	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	But rather, Kevorkian, says he doesn't really need a gas guzzler since he doesn't stray far from his rundown apartment complex anyhow.
19659	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	"I don't enjoy flashy cars.

19686	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	JEEP WRANGLER LESS ROUGH, STILL READY
19687	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Whether planning to drive up the beach on South Padre Island in Texas or on the red-rock trails of Utah's stunningly beautiful Arches National Park, the newest generation of the Jeep Wrangler might very well be the best way to go.
19688	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
19689	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Jeep rolled out the redesigned Wrangler, whose roots can be traced back to the military jeeps used by the U.S. armed forces during World
19690	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	War II.
19691	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	This latest version, though, is a lot more refined than even the previous model, let alone those rather crude early military models.
19692	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable doors.
19693	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Another innovation: Jeep added the first four-door version to the lineup with the redesign -- the model called the Wrangler Unlimited.
19694	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	While some Jeep purists might complain that the newest Wrangler is too gentrified for their tastes, I don't agree.
19695	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	I appreciate having a somewhat comfortable as well as ultimately capable vehicle to take me into the places most people never will see.
19696	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What's important is that the Wrangler's styling remains true to the brand, something Chrysler's designers clearly understood when they created the new generation.
19697	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler still has the signature shape, seven-slot grille, round headlights, trapezoid-shaped wheel flares, exposed door and windshield hinges, and a windshield that can be folded down.
19698	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Changes to the exterior were subtle and included a new molded front bumper with integrated fog lights and sealed headlights with 20 percent brighter halogen bulbs.
19699	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The current Wrangler is 5 inches wider than before, with a track that is 3.5 inches wider.
19700	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The extra width was added to increase interior space, but might be a problem on really narrow trails, such as the ones in Washington state that are used for the annual Cascades Jeep Jamboree.
19701	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	But for most trails, the extra width won't get in the way.
19702	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family.
19703	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The back seat is meant for just two, and there is virtually no cargo space behind the seat.
19704	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
19705	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There still is room only for four people in the two-door model, but the front seats now have 4.6 inches more hip room and 5.1 inches more shoulder room.
19706	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Rear seats have 3.9 inches of additional shoulder room, 1.6 inches more hip room and an inch more legroom.
19707	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
19708	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it -- 46.4 cubic feet.
19709	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The four-door has a 116-inch-wheelbase versus 95.4 inches for the standard-length Wrangler, and it's 20.6 inches longer.
19710	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Even with all of the changes -- including the quietest cabin ever in a Jeep -- the Wrangler still has the off-road abilities that have made the Wrangler the preferred vehicle of serious four- wheel-drive enthusiasts.
19711	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	In fact, the automaker says the new model offers even more off- road prowess than its predecessor.
19712	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The newest Wrangler has more ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems.
19713	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Also added were optional electric axle lockers and an electrically operated disconnecting sway bar.
19714	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and the Rubicon.
19715	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield combinations, Jeep said.
19716	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base price $28,190 plus $700 freight).
19717	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Ours didn't come with the optional hardtop or the glass power windows
19718	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	we had the canvas top, traditional half-doors and zip-down plastic windows.
19719	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	We didn't have the power door locks, either.
19720	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What we did have was the Rubicon's great off-road equipment, which includes
19721	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep's Off-Road Rock-Trac transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, as well as the front and rear electronic axle lockers, the sway-bar system and 32-inch B.F. Goodrich off-road tires.
19722	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter.
19723	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Suspension improvements include advanced shock tuning.
19724	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wranglers -- both the two- and four-door models -- come with a choice of removable hard or soft tops.
19725	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Among those is a three- piece modular top, whose two front sections can be stored inside the vehicle after being removed.

19741	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	SAN ANTONIO
19742	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues -- through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the election.
19743	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	The ads, running on Spanish-language television and radio in states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, feature Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain pointing fingers at each other for not having done enough on immigration.
19744	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
19745	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Obama countered with his own Spanish ad linking McCain to the extreme-right Republican wing, widely seen as anti-immigrant.
19746	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	And so ensued a series of ongoing volleys on an issue that, until eclipsed by rising concerns over the economic meltdown, had retained national interest.
19747	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
19748	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Even before the economy took over as the top campaign issue, neither candidate took the initiative to bring up immigration on the trail because both actually share similar views and neither saw a clear opening to gain political muscle.
19749	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Immigration has been complicated, heated and polarizing," explained Audrey Singer, immigration policy analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. "Definitely not what you want to talk about in the last couple of weeks of the election."
19750	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State University in San Marcos.
19751	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	It's niche political advertising taken to a higher strategic level because it's only in Spanish, noted Subervi, director of the university's Center for the Study of Latino Media and Markets.
19752	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Through these attack ads, they've found a safe way to make their case on who's the best candidate for Latinos," Subervi said.
19753	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"They've found a common denominator that's not offensive to the broader public."
19754	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Each campaign's point person for Hispanic media accused the other's boss of being the culprit of the ad war while avoiding a direct answer on why it's being conducted only in Spanish.
19755	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Federico de Jesus, spokesman for Obama, said McCain started it all by issuing Spanish ads smearing Obama's record on immigration -- and the Obama camp was forced to respond in kind.
19756	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unlike McCain, who's only willing to tackle immigration in Spanish so he won't get burned by his party's more restrictionist base, de Jesus said, Obama shares his views in both languages.
19757	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"We don't have anything to fear or hide," he said.
19758	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	But the fact that Obama always waits for his opponent to take the first step in tackling immigration proves a total lack of leadership on the issue, countered Hessy Fernandez, spokeswoman for McCain.
19759	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.
19760	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Their views on the economy, health care, education and national security are just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.

19833	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA
19834	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Strong opposition to the candidacy of Barack Obama in Arkansas may have helped conservatives pass a measure blocking the adoption of children by unmarried couples.
19835	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The measure, which voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday and which prevents unmarried cohabitating couples from adopting or fostering children, won strong support from conservatives, exit polls found.
19836	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The ban affects all unmarried couples but was written with the intent of preventing gay couples from raising children in Arkansas.
19837	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Unlike most states, Arkansas shifted to the right politically in this election.
19838	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain won the state by 20 points compared with President Bush's 9-point victory in 2004.
19839	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"I think white Arkansas Democrats felt cross-pressured in this race," said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College.
19840	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"They didn't want to vote for what they viewed as Bush's third term, but they also couldn't bring themselves to vote for Barack Obama.
19841	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	One response was just to bow out of voting, and their absence probably helped this proposal succeed."
19842	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Many experts did not expect the measure to pass with Democrats nationwide flooding the polls to support Obama for president.
19843	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Prominent politicians, including former President Bill Clinton and Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, publicly opposed the ban.
19844	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Critics ran television advertisements of foster children pleading with voters not to make it harder for them to find families.
19845	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	But conservatives mounted a grass-roots campaign, mainly through church groups, that framed the state's case-by-case approach to adoption requests as an affront to traditional family values.
19846	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"We believe that the best place for a child to grow up is in a stable home with a married mother and father," said Jerry Cox, president of Family Council Action Committee, which obtained 95,000 signatures to place the proposal on state ballots.
19847	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"But we also believe in blunting a gay agenda that we see at work in other states with regard to marriage and adoption issues."
19848	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Exit polls found that the ban was primarily supported by conservatives, supporters of Bush and evangelicals.
19849	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	After the votes were tallied, adoption groups decried the new policy as contrary to the well-being of children.
19850	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Arkansas has three times as many children who need homes as people willing to adopt or foster them, said Brett Kincaid, the campaign director for Arkansas Families First, a coalition of groups opposing the ban.
19851	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	He said the ban would make adoptions less common.
19852	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Arkansas is not the first state with such a policy.
19853	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Florida prohibits adoption by applicants who identify themselves as gay, Utah prevents unmarried cohabitated couples from adopting and Mississippi specifically bans same-sex couples from adopting.
19854	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	A survey in October by the University of Arkansas found 55 percent of voters in the state opposed to the ban.
19855	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	But conservatives ratcheted up their lobbying before the election, distributing 350,000 inserts for church bulletins, and the measure passed with nearly 57 percent of the vote.
19856	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"I was very surprised that our margin of victory was as wide as it was," Cox said.
19857	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"Our campaign was primarily grass-roots.
19858	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The opposition was primarily a media campaign.

19892	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, convicted last month on federal ethics charges, on Tuesday appeared to have lost his bid for a seventh term as final ballots were counted, giving Democrats at least 58 seats in the Senate for the first years of the Obama administration.
19893	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	With an estimated 2,500 votes still outstanding and other election certification steps still to take place, Mark Begich, the Democratic mayor of Anchorage, had taken a lead by 3,724 votes out of more than 315,000 cast, and he declared victory.
19894	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States Senate," Begich said.
19895	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"It's been an incredible journey getting to this point, and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day.
19896	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	I can't wait to get to work fighting for Alaskan families."
19897	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Stevens did not immediately concede the race.
19898	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	He could request a recount, but he would have to pay for it if the current vote margins hold.
19899	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Begich's victory will end the career of the longest-serving Republican senator ever and a pivotal figure in the history of his state after it initially appeared he would triumph despite his criminal conviction just days before the election.
19900	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The defeat came on Stevens' 85th birthday at the end of a day that saw him avoid expulsion from the Senate Republican Caucus as his colleagues said they would await the final results.
19901	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't wish what I going through on anyone, my worst enemy," Stevens said Tuesday morning in the Capitol.
19902	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Stevens' defeat will strengthen a majority that Democrats sought to keep as large as possible by allowing Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, I-Conn., to retain his high-profile committee chairmanship Tuesday.
19903	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Instead, Democrats dropped Lieberman from another panel, delivering a mild rebuke for his strong support of Sen. John McCain and other Republicans in this month's elections.
19904	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision was part of the post-election congressional tableaux as Senate Democrats and Republicans re-elected their current leadership teams for the first two years of the Obama administration.
19905	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	House Democrats met to make Rep. Nancy Pelsoi of California their candidate for speaker and essentially kept their leadership intact as well, with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland remaining majority leader.
19906	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Aware of the legislative battles ahead, Senate Democrats said they wanted to adhere to President-elect Barack Obama's call for reconciliation and leniency for Lieberman.
19907	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But a pragmatic dynamic was at work as well.
19908	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Having added seven new senators to their side, Democrats want to avoid driving Lieberman to the Republican fold.
19909	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Even though they fell short of the 60 needed to cut off filibusters, the Democrats are aiming to keep their majority as large as possible next year when, for the first time since 1994, they have control of Congress and the White House.
19910	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Two other Senate seats, in Minnesota and Georgia, have yet to be decided as well.
19911	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"We have got some big issues here, and we need all hands on deck," said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who had pushed to keep the retribution against his home-state colleague to a minimum.
19912	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Democrats voted 42-13 to let Lieberman stay at the helm of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs while removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he led a subcommittee.
19913	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The formal resolution before the Democrats, considered in what was described as an emotional meeting in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol, also declared that the Democratic caucus "rejects and disapproves of Senator Lieberman's statements against Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign."
19914	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers who attended the session said that Lieberman openly discussed the political and personal hurt he experienced when many of his colleagues campaigned against him after he lost a Democratic Senate primary in 2006 before winning re-election as an independent.
19915	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After the vote, he expressed some remorse for his campaign comments but noted the resolution did not chastise him directly for backing McCain, who returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to resume life as a senator.
19916	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lieberman, who only eight years ago was the party's nominee for vice president, said there were statements he could have made "more clearly.
19917	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And there are some that I made that I wish I had not made at all.
19918	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And obviously in the heat of campaigns, that happens to all of us.
19919	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But I regret that.
19920	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And now it's time to move on."
19921	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Some Democrats remained angry that Lieberman had been so outspoken not only in his backing for McCain, but also for his campaigning for Republicans such as Sen. Norm Coleman, who continued to hold a narrow lead in his re-election bid in Minnesota.
19922	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	They said that stripping the chairmanship was only fitting.
19923	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Ver., who aligns with Democrats, said allowing Lieberman to run the committee was a "slap in the face" to Americans who "worked day and night to get Barack Obama elected and to move our country in a very new direction."
19924	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"Having said that, there is an enormous amount of work that is facing the Senate, and we all have to move on and work together to address these issues," Sanders said.
19925	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The reluctance of the senators to move forcefully against their colleagues illustrates again how cautious senators are when it comes to punishing their own.
19926	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After being thwarted repeatedly by Republican resistance in the past two years, Senate Democrats were unwilling to lose the support of Lieberman on most domestic policy issues, particularly after Obama had urged that Lieberman be allowed to remain in the Democratic fold.
19927	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The resolution noted that Lieberman's vote gave Democrats the majority in 2007 and that he voted almost 100 percent of the time with the party on key procedural issues.
19928	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I would defy anyone to be more angry than I was," said Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who will remain majority leader, about Lieberman's criticism of Obama.
19929	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"But I also believe that if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk about of here saying, 'Boy, did we get even'?
19930	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	I am very satisfied with what we did today."
19931	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision touched off attacks on the Democrats by liberal and progressive groups and on the Internet, where critics accused Democrats of weakness in their posture against Lieberman, who they have branded a traitor to Democrats.
19932	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But senators pointed to statements by the Obama campaign in support of Lieberman as justification for their decision.
19933	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"The Senate Democratic Caucus has decided that if President-elect Barack Obama can forgive, so can we," said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del.
19934	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Despite a second round of Republican losses, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was returned as Republican leader.
19935	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Senate Republicans also easily disposed of a call by Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina to impose term limits on the Republican leader and members of the Appropriations Committee, overwhelmingly rejecting the proposals.
19936	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	In the House, Democrats gathered for the leadership elections and bid farewell to Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., who is relinquishing his No. 4 post in the party hierarchy to become chief of staff to Obama.
19937	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Those in the closed meeting said Emanuel became emotional and told his colleagues it was "not an easy decision for me" to give up his House seat.
19938	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know, I've got your back," Emanuel said, according to one account.
19939	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I'll feel better knowing that you've got my back."

19941	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	SANTA FE, N.M.
19942	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has a reputation for doing whatever it takes to cajole companies to invest here in his home state, from giving movie producers his private phone number to building a special water-treatment plant for a cheese company.
19943	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a handshake.
19944	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's the ideal closer," said Rick Homans, a longtime aide.
19945	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We would set it up and he would close it."
19946	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	In his six years as governor, Richardson, whom President-elect Barack Obama has chosen to be commerce secretary, has created 80,000 jobs while revamping this impoverished state's economy.
19947	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The governor has created a thriving film industry here from scratch and has nurtured a fledgling solar-energy sector, mostly through tax breaks for investors.
19948	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He has also persuaded several light manufacturers to set up shop, attracted investments from high-tech companies, built a commuter railroad and transformed a sleepy border crossing into a transportation hub to increase trade with Mexico.
19949	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	In perhaps his biggest gamble, Richardson has procured financing for a spaceport in southern New Mexico, called Spaceport America, from which he envisions tourists departing on cruises beyond the atmosphere.
19950	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Just about every project he put on the table was big and visionary and cost a lot of money," said Teri Cole, the president of the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce.
19951	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's not one to spend a lot of time on small projects."
19952	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	It remains to be seen whether Richardson can do something similar on the national level.
19953	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he wants his commerce secretary to play a pivotal role in salvaging the economy, and aides to Richardson say they expect that he will try to expand the traditional role of the office.
19954	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to elevate this office to a level of importance that it genuinely deserves during this economic crisis," said Homans, who is the state tax commissioner.
19955	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to be, in some respects, reinventing the Department of Commerce."
19956	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Richardson said at a news conference here on Thursday that he would apply to the national economy some of the same principles he used to create jobs in New Mexico.
19957	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Obviously," he said, "we need to rebuild America's economy, domestically and internationally, create jobs and get ourselves out of this stagnant situation."
19958	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But economists and political opponents point out that Richardson has benefited from record-high oil and natural gas prices during his tenure as governor.
19959	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	As a result, state coffers were overflowing with revenue from taxes on oil and gas production.
19960	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
19961	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The oil and gas revenue also made it easier to finance big projects, like the $230 million spaceport and a $400 million commuter railroad from south of Albuquerque to Santa Fe.
19962	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Economists say that job growth, too, owed a lot to the boom in the oil and natural gas fields.
19963	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	With the price of oil plummeting, the growth in jobs has leveled off here and a projected $500 million shortfall has opened up in the state budget.
19964	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Still, no one doubts the state would be worse off in the current recession had it not been for Richardson's success in attracting investment and creating jobs.
19965	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Business leaders whom Richardson has wooed say he is a tough negotiator, hard to resist one on one.
19966	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Gerald J. Fine, the president of Schott North America, recalled how in January Richardson, who was then running for president, took the time to personally negotiate a deal under which Schott would build a $100 million plant in Albuquerque to make solar energy panels.
19967	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It was the only time I've ever been given a presidential candidate's cell phone number by a presidential candidate," Fine said.
19968	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Just before the New Hampshire primary, Richardson met with the company's board chairman, Udo Ungeheuer, at a hotel in Concord.
19969	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	After they went over the fine points of the agreement, Richardson, a physically imposing man, suddenly stood and reached a big hand over the table and asked, "Do we have a deal?"
19970	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Ungeheuer was taken aback, but a few seconds later shook on it, according to people who were present.
19971	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"The way the deal was sealed was with a handshake, and he made sure he got that handshake before he left the room," said Fine, still sounding somewhat incredulous.
19972	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We built a plant in New Mexico on the basis of a handshake."
19973	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Some of Richardson's detractors, however, say he can be overbearing and vicious when he does not get his way.
19974	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He enjoys the limelight that comes from his visionary pronouncements, they say, and he is impatient with opponents.
19975	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It's his way or the highway," said the state Senate president pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat who has clashed with the governor over spending.
19976	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Anyone who dares to differ with him, he doesn't take very well."
19977	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the growth of the film industry in New Mexico attests to Richardson's skills as a salesman and deal-closer.
19978	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Shortly after taking office in 2003, the governor went to Hollywood to meet with the heads of major studios.
19979	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"To a person, their mouths were agape, as if to say, 'Is this guy really here?"'
19980	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	recalled Eric Witt, a deputy chief of staff.
19981	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But Richardson has lured producers, one by one, from large Hollywood studios to New Mexico with tax abatements and personal pressure.
19982	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He urges producers to call him directly in case they run into hurdles in procuring permits, visits the sets and regularly holds dinners for actors and producers at the governor's mansion.
19983	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, more than 115 feature films and television series have been made here, among them the Oscar-winning "No Country for Old Men."
19984	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Richardson was smart enough to see this would work," said Nick Smerigan, who heads the newly built Albuquerque Studios, several large soundstages on the desert flatlands.

20036	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	At least 23 people drowned and 33 others were missing after an overloaded passenger ferry capsized off a northern Philippine province, the coast guard said Monday.
20037	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	The authorities said they recovered the bodies of 23 victims, who drowned after huge waves overturned the Maejan, a ferry carrying 102 passengers, just 200 feet off the shoreline of Cagayan province, north of Manila, on Sunday morning.

20063	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A new military plan for troop withdrawals from Iraq that was described in broad terms this week to President-elect Barack Obama falls short of the 16-month timetable Obama outlined during his election campaign, U.S. military officials said Wednesday.
20064	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan was proposed by the top American commanders responsible for Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno, and it represents their first recommendation on troop withdrawals under an Obama presidency.
20065	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	While Obama has said he will seek advice from his commanders, their resistance to a faster drawdown could present the new president with a tough political choice between overruling his generals or backing away from his goal.
20066	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan, completed last week, envisions withdrawing two more brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, from Iraq in the first six months of 2009, the military officials said.
20067	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	But that would leave 12 combat brigades in Iraq by June 2009, and while declining to be more specific, the officials made clear that the withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals' recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010, Obama's target.
20068	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Transition officials said the plan was described in only general terms to Obama by Robert M. Gates, who is staying on as defense secretary, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when Obama met for five and a half hours with his national security team on Monday in Chicago.
20069	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	They said all participants had sidestepped the details of how to reconcile Obama's timetable for withdrawing combat forces with the more extended one recommended by the generals.
20070	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A transition official said that in future meetings, "the military will get a chance to articulate their preferences."
20071	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	In the campaign, Obama said he would not hesitate to overrule his commanders.
20072	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	By early December, however, he signaled some flexibility when he said that he still wanted combat troops out of Iraq in 16 months but that he would also listen to the recommendations of his generals.
20073	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gates has expressed confidence that he and Obama might reach common ground.
20074	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	But in discussing the new plan, senior military officials nonetheless made clear that they were not comfortable with the time frame Obama articulated in the campaign.
20075	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"Sixteen months is going to be tough," said one senior military officer who was briefed on the plan.
20076	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"We are not quite there yet."
20077	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Those at the Chicago meeting included Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama's choice for secretary of state
20078	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.

20085	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	and Anthony Blinken, a senior foreign policy adviser to Biden.
20086	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Obama apparently did not ask Gates or Mullen for specifics on withdrawals, according to people briefed on the discussions.
20087	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"There was not challenging or questioning of any particular timetable," a transition official said.
20088	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"There wasn't a point on which there was any pushback from either side."
20089	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	For his part, Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Gates had left the Chicago meeting feeling that "they had an excellent discussion, and excellent chemistry as well."
20090	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan drafted by Odierno and Petraeus was drawn up to meet the so-called status of forces agreement between the United States and Iraqi governments that calls for all American forces to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 and all combat troops out of Iraqi cities by June 2009.
20091	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The agreement sets forth both a shorter and longer timetable than Obama's campaign pledge, with some combat forces out sooner but all forces out later.
20092	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	One way commanders say they will try to meet that first deadline is by effectively reassigning combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the difference would be in some cases semantic because armed American troops would still go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.
20093	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The participants at the Chicago meeting did discuss the deadline for all American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraqi cities by June, as outlined in the agreement with the Iraqi government.
20094	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A person familiar with the talks said those at the meeting discussed whether the Iraqis would allow "re-missioned" combat forces to remain in Iraqi cities after June.
20095	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gates and Mullen did not rule out the idea that Iraqis might permit such troops, the person said.
20096	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	In a briefing to reporters last week in Balad, Iraq, Odierno said that some American forces would remain in a support role in Iraqi cities beyond the June deadline.
20097	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	He said that the troops would be deployed at numerous security outposts in urban areas to help support and train Iraqi forces.
20098	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"We'll maintain our very close partnership with the Iraqi security forces throughout Iraq even after the summer," he said.
20099	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Odierno said that it was particularly important for American troops to support Iraqis in 2009, when three elections, at the provincial, district and national levels, are scheduled.
20100	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"It's important that we maintain enough presence here that we can help them through this year of transition," he said.
20101	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Odierno also said that he was planning for all American forces to be out of Iraq by 2011, as called for in the agreement with the Iraqi government, but he said the agreement could be renegotiated.
20102	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"Three years is a long time," Odierno said.
20103	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The new military plan also calls for American troops in Iraq after 2011, but it does not put a number on that force, a person familiar with its details said.
20104	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Other topics discussed at the meeting in Chicago included Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, the detainees at Guantanamo Bay and how the national security policy-making process in the Obama administration would work.

20110	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	In presidential decor, one must remember the public eye is fixed on everything you do."
20111	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's transition team has not responded to inquiries about his interior design plans.
20112	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	However the Obamas decide to proceed, they'll have to follow a few basic rules.
20113	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	For starters, they will have to pay for their own movers.
20114	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	And while Congress budgets $100,000 in household transition costs for every new administration, if the Obamas spend more than that -- and most first families do -- they will have to cover the expense of decorating their private quarters with private donations.

20118	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	When it comes to the private quarters, on the second and third floors, and the Oval Office, though, the decor is the "personal decision of the first family," said Tom Savage, director of museum affairs at Winterthur in Delaware and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House during the Clinton administration.
20119	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	"But there are so many safeguards.
20120	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	The misconception of the public is that a first family can make very dramatic changes, and that's just not so."

20122	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Q: I'm planning a trip to Switzerland for Christmas and New Year's.
20123	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Can you recommend some artistic neighborhoods like Williamsburg in Brooklyn?
20124	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	-- Anya
20125	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	A: There are a number of Swiss cities that can whet your appetite for hip, artistic neighborhoods.
20126	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	An excellent itinerary can be made of Zurich, Geneva and Bern, guided by the archived articles on our destination guides for those cities at nytimes.com/travel.
20127	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Zurich West, a former industrial quarter of Switzerland's largest city, was described by Michael J. Agovino, fittingly for your question, as "not unlike Williamsburg" in "Going to: Zurich" (April 30, 2006).
20128	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	"For the young and hip Swiss, as well as the European cosmopolites who come for the weekend, it's all about the west," he wrote.
20129	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Must-sees include Lowenbrauareal in Zurich West (Limmatstrasse 270), a converted brewery that is now home to galleries and museums, including the Migros Museum (41-44-277-2050, www.migrosmuseum.ch).
20130	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	For a break there is Spheres cafe (Hardturmstrasse 66
20131	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	41-44-440-6622), which Agovino said is "one of the coolest and most relaxed spots in Zurich West."
20132	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Good dinner choices in the area, he said, include LaSalle (Schiffbaustrasse 4
20133	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	41-44-258-7071) and Rosso (Geroldstrasse 31
20134	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	41-43-818-2254)
20135	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	LaSalle is also recommended by Alison Langley in "What's Doing: Zurich" (Nov. 23, 2003).
20136	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	In Geneva, head to the village of Carouge, a 10-minute tram ride from the city across the Arve River.
20137	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	It's friendly and picturesque, according to Natasha C. Burley in "Finding a New Cool Geneva (Even in the Old Town)" (Sept. 19, 2004), and "a haunt for artists and craftsmen, fashion boutiques, small bistros and gourmet restaurants."
20138	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	She favorably reviewed Au Vieux Carouge (27, rue Jacques Dalphin
20139	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	41-22-342-6498), a fondue restaurant in Carouge.
20140	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	.
20141	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	Bern's Matte district, on the southeastern tip of the Old Town, is described by the city guide Bern-Switzerland.
20142	NYT_ENG_20081221.0031.LDC2009T13	com as a former "district of traders and gypsies" that is now "quaint and the funky, where small streets are lined with interesting boutiques and small eateries."
20143	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	BARGAIN-HUNTING, AND FEELING SHEEPISH ABOUT IT
20144	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding -- even more than usual for an industry that's been anticipating its demise since the advent of television.
20145	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The holiday season that just ended is likely to have been one of the worst in decades.
20146	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Publishers have been cutting back and laying off.
20147	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it wouldn't be acquiring any new manuscripts, a move akin to a butcher shop proclaiming it had stopped ordering fresh meat.
20148	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Bookstores, both new and secondhand, are faltering as well.
20149	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Olsson's, the leading independent chain in Washington, went bankrupt and shut down in September.
20150	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Robin's, which says it is the oldest bookstore in Philadelphia, will close next month.
20151	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The once-mighty Borders chain is on the rocks.
20152	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Powell's, the huge store in Portland, Ore., said sales were so weak it was encouraging its staff to take unpaid sabbaticals.
20153	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Don't blame this carnage on the recession or any of the usual suspects, including increased competition for the reader's time or diminished attention spans.
20154	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	What's undermining the book industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing habits of devoted readers.
20155	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In other words, it's all the fault of people like myself, who increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after their value to us is gone, sell them.
20156	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	This is not about Amazon peddling new books at discounted prices, which has been a factor in the book business for a decade, but about the rise of a worldwide network of amateurs who sell books from their homes or, if they're lazy like me, in partnership with an Internet dealer who does all the work for a chunk of the proceeds.
20157	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	They get their books from friends, yard sales, recycling centers, their own shelves, castoffs (I just bought a book from a guy whose online handle was Clif Is Emptying His Closet).
20158	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Some list them for as little as a penny, although most aim for at least a buck.
20159	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	This growing market is achieving an aggregate mass that is starting to prove problematic for publishers, new bookstores and secondhand bookstores.
20160	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	For readers and collectors, these resellers, as they are called, offer a great service.
20161	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lost in the hand-wringing over the state of the book industry is the fact that this is a golden age for those in love with old-fashioned printed volumes: More books are available for less effort and less money than ever before.
20162	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A book search engine like ViaLibri.net can knit together 20,000 booksellers around the world offering tens of millions of nearly new, used or rare books.
20163	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this?
20164	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Now it's become both an economic and a moral issue.
20165	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	How much do I want to pay, and where do I want that money to go?
20166	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To my local community via a bookstore?
20167	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To the publisher?
20168	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To the author?
20169	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In theory, I want to support all of these fine folks.
20170	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In practice, I decide to save a buck.
20171	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Here's one example of how I casually wreak destruction.
20172	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	I was reading "Sylvia," an account by the late short-story master Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife.
20173	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon.
20174	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	I could buy a new paperback edition of that book, "Room for Doubt," for $13.95 plus tax in a bookstore.
20175	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	But there were dozens of copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent, plus shipping.
20176	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping.
20177	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three -- nor the author got a share.
20178	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The book looked good as new.
20179	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lesser is the publisher of The Threepenny Review, a literary journal.
20180	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She lives in Berkeley, Calif., where, as it happens, there is no longer a large general interest bookstore.
20181	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Cody's, in its prime one of the country's great stores, closed its last outlet in June.
20182	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The Barnes &amp
20183	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	amp
20184	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Noble store there also recently closed.
20185	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Andy Ross, the former owner of Cody's, told me that buying books online "was not morally dubious, but it is tragic.
20186	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	It has a lot of unintended consequences for communities."
20187	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Ross said he realized that Cody's was doomed when he noticed that in the last year he hadn't sold a single copy of that old- reliable for undergraduates, Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."
20188	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Students presumably were buying it online.
20189	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Sales of classics and other backlist titles used to be the financial engine of publishers and bookstores as well, allowing them to take chances on new authors.
20190	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Clearly, that model is breaking.
20191	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Simon &amp
20192	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	amp
20193	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Schuster, which laid off staffers this month, cited backlist sales as a particularly troubled area.
20194	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Michael Barnard, who owns Rakestraw Books in Danville, Calif., not far from Berkeley, was more critical of me.
20195	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	He said that I was taking Lesser's work while depriving her of an income, and that I would regret my selfish actions when all the physical stores were gone.
20196	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lesser's editor, Dan Frank, said that the rise of resellers like Heather Blue meant that there was no longer a set price for a book at any one time.
20197	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If you want it during those first few weeks when it is new, you will pay a premium.
20198	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If you can wait, it might be only a pittance.
20199	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"These cracks and fractures will only grow bigger," he said.
20200	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lesser herself was philosophical.
20201	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"I am a pragmatist, not a thin- skinned, delicate little writer who thinks everything needs to be what it is in heaven," she said.
20202	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Still, she sounded a little taken aback at the going rate for her books.
20203	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"Twenty-five cents?
20204	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	That's all it was?"
20205	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	At least this way, the writer said, she gained a reader if not an income.
20206	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If I had had to search for the book in a store, maybe I would never have found it.
20207	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"With the Internet, nothing is ever lost," Lesser said.
20208	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"That's the good news, and that's the bad news."
20209	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	And what of the woman who sold me the book?
20210	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She told me via e-mail that her real name was Heather Mash and that she worked as a domestic violence case manager in a women's shelter not too far from Berkeley.
20211	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She didn't set out to subvert the publishing and bookselling world, she said.
20212	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Like most of us who sell online, Mash began because she had too many books and wanted to raise money to buy more.
20213	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"I would rather sell a book for a penny and let someone enjoy it than keep it collecting dust," she said.
20214	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	No industry undermined by its greatest partisans will thrive long.
20215	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	CD sales plunged after music could be downloaded.
20216	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Newspapers are hurting even as their readership is mushrooming online.
20217	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	As the Heather Mashes proliferate, traditional bookstores will continue to fade.
20218	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Secondhand outlets that don't sell online are already an anachronism.
20219	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Even the novelist Larry McMurtry, whose enormous secondhand shop in Archer City, Texas, was probably the biggest holdout against the Internet, has surrendered.
20220	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The first book he sold online was a signed copy of "84, Charing Cross Road," the classic account of a woman in postwar New York who bought her books from a London shop she never saw.
20221	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Helene Hanff's slim volume used to be cherished for its depiction of a vanished era.
20222	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Now it seems simply ahead of its time.
20223	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	DISAPPOINTED ON TWO FRONTS
20224	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	With strong safety Jermaine Phillips out with a broken arm, Sabby Piscitelli has been under increased scrutiny lately.
20225	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And the second-year player from Oregon State responded Sunday with a memorable interception.
20226	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The Bucs led 17-14 early in the fourth, but the Raiders had it first and 10 at the Bucs 26.
20227	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Moments earlier, a face mask against Gaines Adams wiped out Phillip Buchanon's interception.
20228	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right toward tight end Zach Miller.
20229	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The ball was off the mark and Piscitelli was off to the races.
20230	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field, shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11 for an 84-yard return.
20231	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.
20232	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Piscitelli, 25, talked about the return and the disappointment of the season-ending 31-24 defeat.
20233	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Describe the play.
20234	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	JaMarcus tried to look me off, and I just got a good break on it.
20235	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was a good rush and made him (overthrow it).
20236	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I tried to play the ball and do what I could with it.
20237	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm kind of disappointed I didn't score, but that's a long run.
20238	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What was going through your head as you were nearing the end zone?
20239	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I was trying to score.
20240	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I cut back and broke a tackle or two, but your body almost shuts off at that point.
20241	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I even tried to stop and let JaMarcus run by me.
20242	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But my legs were just (shot).
20243	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I just wanted to get all the yards I could at that second.
20244	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Did you see the block that Jackson threw for you?
20245	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Actually, when I cut off that (block), that's when my body starting shutting down.
20246	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm just glad the offense scored, and it kind of bailed us out of that situation.
20247	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What has happened to this team in the fourth quarter?
20248	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	No excuses.
20249	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	You go to the film, and the most important thing is you have to finish.
20250	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think we did play well on defense.
20251	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But we have to go to the film and see what our mistakes were.
20252	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It's a four-quarter game, and I'm disappointed I couldn't help the team more.
20253	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How disappointing is it to have the season end this way?

20508	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	China's cultural authorities are introducing a national qualification program for actors, singers and dancers.
20509	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	The program, expected to start later this year, is open to all current and aspiring performing artists, said Guo Wei, an official with the Center of Cultural and Artistic Talents (CCAT) with the Ministry of Culture.
20510	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"We hope the qualification will provide an authentic reference for art troupes and organizations in evaluating staff and recruiting new actors, singers or dancers," said Guo.
20511	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	Sources with the CCAT said the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security have been planning the program for more than four years.
20512	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"The purpose of such a program is to improve the professional level of China's art circles and discover more talented artists," said an official with the CCAT, who declined to be named.
20513	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	The program would consist of two parts: a performance and a written test of professional knowledge.
20514	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	Guo said the program is currently operating on a voluntary basis.
20515	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"It is not compulsory now, but we hope it could be widely recognized in the future so that it could become authoritative."

20517	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	ABUJA, April 27 (Xinhua)
20518	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The All Nigeria Peoples' Party ( ANPP) is planning to go to the Election Petition Tribunal to seek redress of the outcome of presidential poll, newspapers in Nigeria reported on Friday.
20519	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The ANPP's plan was made on Thursday after it resolved differences with its presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari on what steps to take on the outcome of the April 21 election, the newspapers reported.
20520	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday afternoon announced that Umaru Yar'Adua from the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) wins Nigerian presidential election with 24 million ballots.
20521	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	But major opposition parties like the ANPP and Action Congress claimed that they do not believe and would not accept the election results.
20522	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The ANPP also said it would support mass action or any form of civil protest by civil society organizations over the conduct of April 14 and 21 poll, which it said, were massively rigged.
20523	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The National Chairman of ANPP Edwin Ume-Ezeoke made the party's official position known at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday.
20524	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	Buhari and the party leadership met for many hours at the party secretariat in Abuja, where they reached a consensus on the matter.
20525	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	Buhari had reportedly opposed court action because of his harrowing experience in 2003, when he spent three years before the case was disposed off by the Supreme Court in favor of President Olusegun Obasanjo.
20526	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The Vice-Chairman of the Media Committee of the ANPP Presidential Campaign Osita Okechukwu said the party would not recognize Yar' Adua's government, adding they "call for the total cancellation of the presidential election while requesting for a fresh election immediately."
20527	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	He said the party would initiate moves through its elected representatives in the National Assembly to sponsor a bill that would reform the INEC so as to remove it from government's interference.

20544	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	Falling food prices lowered Kenya's overall annual inflation rate to 5.7 percent in April from 5.9 percent in March this year, the country's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said Thursday.
20545	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	In a statement, the CBS said that the underlying inflation rate, which excludes changes in the prices of food items, declined to 5.
20546	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	9 per cent in April from 6.1 percent in March.
20547	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 1.3 percent from March to April," the CBS said.
20548	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices over time in fixed market baskets of goods and services typically purchased by consumers.

20550	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	This, according to the CBS, was mainly attributed to a fall in prices of tomatoes, kales, maize flour, sugar and maize grain.
20551	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	The power and fuel index declined by 0.9 percent due to a drop in the cost of electricity.

20555	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	URUMQI, May 4 (Xinhua)
20556	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The long drought in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is threatening the survival of the country's tiny beaver population, according to local forestry sources.
20557	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	In northern Xinjiang's Altay area, low water levels have driven the semi-aquatic rodents from the Ulungur River, their main habitat in China, to look for new homes.
20558	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	"We have received reports that beavers have died searching for new habitats.
20559	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some are killed by dogs and some simply die from thirst," said Han Baohong, director of the forestry bureau in Fuhai County, on the lower reaches of the Ulungur River.
20560	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	"After the snow has melted in May, the drought will make living conditions even worse," he said.
20561	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some beavers had started digging into the banks of irrigation channels, posing a threat to local agricultural production.
20562	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The population of beavers in China is about 500, even lower than that of the giant panda.
20563	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Beavers usually spend winter in nests built in riverbanks where water levels exceed 1.5 meters.
20564	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The Altay region had seen little precipitation since last winter and has recorded its driest spring since 1974.
20565	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The water volume of the Ulungur River is just 60 percent of level at the same time last year.
20566	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The forestry administration has called on residents to help protect beavers.
20567	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	It has also assigned workers to track the animals so they can help them survive.

20573	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	Serre said France would accompany the efforts of Cameroon in the area of infrastructure construction, education, health, agriculture and the promotion of private sector.

20638	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	"This will be an open competition not only welcoming participants from China but also from abroad," said Lu Hao, vice mayor of Beijing.

20645	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua)
20646	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Seven best-known beaches in the Los Angeles County rank among California's 10 most polluted, according to an annual environmental report.
20647	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	For the second straight year, Los Angeles County had the worst coastal water quality in the state for the 12 months ending March 31, said the report by the environmental group Heal the Bay.
20648	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Although record low rainfall made most of California's coastal waters safer to bathe in over the past year by reducing contaminated storm and creek runoff into the ocean, it wasn't enough to improve potentially risky bacteria levels at some of Los Angeles County's best known beaches, according to the report published by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
20649	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	The nonprofit group assesses daily and weekly fecal bacteria pollution from nearly 500 California beach sites from Humboldt County to the Mexican border, giving each a grade of A through F.
20650	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Beaches rated F included Surfrider and Marie Canyon storm drain in Malibu, Santa Monica Municipal Pier area, Castle Rock in the Pacific Palisades area, and Avalon on Catalina Island.
20651	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Higher bacteria counts raise the risk of contracting gastrointestinal ailments, ear infections, upper respiratory infections and skin rashes, and can also harm fish and wildlife.
20652	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	The biggest surprise in this year's report: the dramatic deterioration in water quality along the several-mile Long Beach coastline, which ranked worst in the state, said Mark Gold, president of Heal the Bay.
20653	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of the 25 beaches tested there received grades of C through F -- 14 of them Ds and Fs -- leading the environmental group to lump the city's beaches into a single entity.
20654	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	"It's a very dramatic change, as Long Beach historically has had excellent water quality," Gold said.

20659	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)
20660	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday issued a notice to call for intensified prevention and control of blue-ear pig disease as the country is entering the peak season for the disease.
20661	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The highly pathogenic blue-ear disease, also known as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), has already killed 18,000 pigs this year.
20662	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice said local governments should improve the emergency plans for the disease outbreak and section off and cease pork trading in affected areas at the time of an outbreak.
20663	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	New vaccines for the disease, produced under the supervision of China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory Institution, have been put into use, said the notice.
20664	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Local governments should establish immunity records for pigs, it said.
20665	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said local authorities should increase studies on the cause of the disease and strengthen inspections and quarantine of pig delivery.
20666	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Pig breeders have been ordered not to kill, eat, sale and deliver pigs that have died from the disease and treat the dead animals and their excrement properly, according to the notice.
20667	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said stricter disinfection measures should be taken in small pig farms.
20668	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Between January and May, 45,000 pigs contracted the disease, but a ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions had reported outbreaks.
20669	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Earlier reports said south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had reported outbreaks.
20670	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The ministry has dispatched inspection teams to supervise disease control and prevention work.
20671	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some areas.
20672	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	It is believed the price hikes will help raise the country's consumer price index, or CPI, to a new high for May.

20692	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	An official at the Nepali Home Ministry on Saturday said it would be difficult for the Nepali government to hold the elections to constituent assembly (CA) at the same time across the country, the local media house's website ekantipur.com reported Saturday.
20693	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Secretary of the Home Ministry Umesh Mainali said the task of holding CA polls across the country at the same time would be difficult because of the insufficient number of police personnel, including Armed Police Force (APF) at the government's disposal.
20694	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a program held in Dolakha, some 50 km east of Kathmandu, Mainali said, "With the Election Commission's (EC) repeated refusal to hold the elections, it will be very difficult for some 55,000 police and 23,000 APF to provide security at all polling booths."
20695	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Stating that it was impossible to assign three-four police personnel per polling station, Home Secretary Mainali said that it was necessary to set up temporary security outfits for the election.
20696	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Claiming that the Home Ministry was committed to holding timely election come what may, Mainali informed that 455 vehicles -- enough for each police post -- had already arrived and that the government will make arrangements for 10,000 communication sets.

20699	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	U.S. retail sales fell by 0.9 percent in June, the sharpest plunge since August 2005, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
20700	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The drop in retail sales for June followed an increase of 1.5 percent in May.
20701	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	In June, sales of autos and auto parts dropped by 2.9 percent, after a 1.1-percent gain in the previous month.

20705	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Gasoline stations saw sales drop by 1.1 percent, a decline attributed to a temporary fall in gasoline prices in June.
20706	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Excluding auto and parts sales, total retail sales would have fallen by 0.4 percent, the weakest performance in this category since last September.
20707	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The performance in retail sales reflects the situation of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity and is a major force pushing economic growth.
20708	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The June drop in retail sales was much sharper than the flat reading expected by economists and raised new worries about consumer spending, according to analysts.

20746	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	A video clip shot by sailors aboard U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan has been pulled off the YouTube video sharing website after Navy officials complained it might compromise security, a report said Saturday.
20747	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The video, apparently shot by sailors based at a naval base in California, has caused one sailor to be "counseled" and the ship's captain to be called to the Pentagon to review security procedures, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
20748	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The report said that the video was pulled even after a senior Navy admiral had recommended that sailors watch the video, which showed female sailors on board the Reagan merrily performing their duties as set to country music.
20749	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Titled "Women of CVN 76: 'That Don't Impress Me Much'," the four- minute clip had been viewed 31,000 times before it was pulled off the popular website, apparently by the person who posted it.
20750	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	CVN 76 is the Navy's call-sign for the aircraft carrier, which is longer than the height of the Empire State Building and home to 5,500 sailors.

20781	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	YANGON, Sept. 3 (Xinhua)
20782	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Myanmar announced the complete end of its national convention here Monday, laying down all detailed basic principles for drafting a new state constitution.
20783	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here said this is the formal end of the first step of a seven-step roadmap to democracy.
20784	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a general election to produce parliament representatives and formation of a new democratic government in line with the government's seven-step roadmap.
20785	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
20786	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The country will adopt an executive system of President as head of state and empower a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union Parliament) which comprises Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) in legislation.
20787	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic system economically.
20788	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
20789	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
20790	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Besides, armed forces members are also to be nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and border affairs.
20791	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The defense services commander-in-chief will represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the right to take over and exercise state power in case of state emergency that could cause disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national sovereignty.
20792	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
20793	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	It will not allow foreign troops to be deployed in the country.
20794	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
20795	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
20796	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
20797	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	As a result, the national convention turned into a status of long adjournment from March 1996 to April 2004.
20798	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Aimed at realization of national reconciliation and pushing forward the process of democratization, the military government announced the seven-step roadmap in August 2003, which mainly include the reconvening of national convention, drafting of new state constitution, holding of national referendum on drafted constitution, sponsoring general election and formation of new civilian government.
20799	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
20800	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	However, citing the reason of military government's house arrest placed on the party's general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and its vice-chairman U Tin Oo, the NLD kept boycotting the convention until its end.
20801	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of the constitutional national convention but did not mention the duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the time table about when the national referendum on the drafted constitution will be held.
20802	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here commented that Myanmar's constitution-drafting process is still not finished yet and the public concern will naturally focus on the country people's decision on the drafted constitution in the upcoming national referendum.

20807	XIN_ENG_20070906.0503.LDC2009T13	The website also posted an image from the forthcoming video.
20808	XIN_ENG_20070906.0503.LDC2009T13	The image of bin Laden contained in the banner found on jihadist forums is reminiscent of his last video appearance in 2004, but his beard is now completely black, as it was previously streaked with grey.

20827	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	RAMALLAH, Sept. 17 (Xinhua)
20828	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	A member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Monday urged the U.S. administration, in particular U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to be clear in its political stance before the Middle East peace conference slated for November.
20829	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	"The political stances of the U.S. administration in general, and its Secretary of State in special, as well as the similar attitudes of the Israeli government decrease the creditability of the U.S. administration," said Taysser Khaled, member of the PLO's executive committee.
20830	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	"Those U.S. administration's policies seem to be maneuvers rather than a political initiative aimed at calming down the Arabic conditions," Khaled added.
20831	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	Rice is slated to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday to discuss preparations for November conference which will probe ways of resuming Israeli-Palestinian political negotiations.
20832	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	He warned that the conference will be "meaningless" should either there is not a real political process or the Arab nations did not involve in the process.
20833	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	"The PLO, Syria and Lebanon must be part of the conference," Khaled put it explicitly.
20834	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	He also called on Egypt and Jordan, who are set to join the conference, not to take part in if a breakthrough, i.e. Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, was not certain.
20835	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	New constitution will be for Turkey instead of AKP: Turkish PM
20836	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	ANKARA, Sept. 19 (Xinhua)
20837	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that efforts were being exerted to prepare a new constitution for Turkey, not for his Justice and Development Party (AKP).
20838	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Erdogan told a press briefing in Turkish capital of Ankara that "We are not drafting a constitution for AKP but we set out on this road to prepare a constitution for the Turkish Republic."
20839	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The top official said that "We are going to submit the draft constitution to parliament after a great deal of discussion is made on it."
20840	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the British daily Financial Times published on Wednesday, Erdogan said, "we want a constitution that is going to provide and protect a state that is a democratic, secular, social state of law."
20841	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	According to the official, a wide-ranging debate would be held on the new constitution, which is being drafted by a team led by constitutional scholars.
20842	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been involved in preparing alternatives for the constitution and the European Constitution was also taken into consideration during the drafting process.
20843	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The cabinet is due to submit the final version of the draft by early next week to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a referendum is expected to be held to ratify the constitution.
20844	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Turkey has had three constitutions so far and the current constitution, which was written in the early 1980s, is the third one which had often been criticized as being too restrictive.
20845	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The first one was adopted in the early 20th century when modern Turkey was founded and the second one was approved after a military coup in 1961.

20847	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (Xinhua)
20848	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	In the next several weeks, the New York Stock Exchange plans to shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged, the New York Times reported Sunday on its website.
20849	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The exchange has been the hub of financial activity in Lower Manhattan for more than a century, but the buzz emanating from its famous trading floor is dying down as computerized trading has rapidly reduced the need for face-to-face transactions.
20850	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak.
20851	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The "crowd" -- the brokers and clerks on the floor -- has dwindled to about 1,700 from a high of more than 3,000, said the report.
20852	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade.
20853	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Now, about 800 brokers pay the annual 50,000-dollar fee for a license.
20854	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The exchange's neighborhood is transforming just as quickly.
20855	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Only a few major financial firms, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, still maintain headquarters on or near Wall Street.
20856	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and Hermes.
20857	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The decline in activity at the exchange's headquarters at 11 Wall Street is palpable.
20858	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds to survey the floor from the visitors' gallery or watch the ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells.
20859	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Excluded for security reasons since 9/11, they can only wander by the building that has long symbolized the heart of American commerce.
20860	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Inside the exchange, a once-vital organ has been reduced to a reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable.
20861	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Even on its busiest day, the trading floor is a sideshow compared with the center-ring attraction it was several years ago.
20862	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Most of the action in shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange happens electronically, between the computers of traders at brokerage houses, mutual fund companies and home offices in spare bedrooms.
20863	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	City officials express hope that the executives who run the exchange will find a way to maintain its image as the gold standard of financial markets, but they are resigned to its diminished physical presence and the permanent loss of jobs on the floor, said the New York Times.

20897	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires, fanned by high winds of 29 to 50 kilometers per hour, are spreading quickly.
20898	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	"It is hard to make out the size of forests devoured by the blaze on satellite pictures due to clouds," an official with the meteorological bureau told Xinhua in an interview.

20903	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (Xinhua)
20904	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	The United States said Tuesday that the controversial nuclear deal with India is "not dead" amid reports saying that the deal appears close to collapse.
20905	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	"India is a thriving democracy and they have work to do and they may need some additional time on their end to get their part of this deal done," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
20906	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	"The president is willing and is very understanding that the Indians may need more time for this.
20907	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	But no, it's not -- it's not dead," Fratto said.
20908	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	According to a report by the Washington Post Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told U.S. President George W. Bush on Monday that "certain difficulties" would prevent India from moving forward on the pact for the foreseeable future.
20909	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	Besieged over the past two months by growing opposition to nuclear energy cooperation with the United States, Singh indicated over the weekend that he would rather save his coalition government than the nuclear pact, the report said.
20910	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	The United States and India reached a historic agreement on civil nuclear cooperation in March 2006, under which India will get access to U.S. civil nuclear technology, and open its nuclear facilities for inspection.
20911	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	Bush in December 2006 signed into law a bill approved by Congress, a major step toward letting India buy U.S. nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years.
20912	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	But U.S. Congress attached several conditions to the law and the two countries have returned to negotiations.
20913	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	According to the conditions, the United States would be required to end the export of nuclear materials if India tests another nuclear device.
20914	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	India had nuclear tests in 1998.
20915	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	It also does not guarantee uninterrupted fuel supplies for reactors and prevents India from reprocessing spent fuel.
20916	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	Indian critics say the agreement will put restrictions on the country's nuclear weapons program.

20922	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	The ministry asked its local branches and all schools to be aware and report illegal employment to the authorities.
20923	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Chinese law bans minors under the age of 16 from working and those between 16 and 18 must be given easier and safer work than adult workers.
20924	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Employers who violate the law can be fined and, if the crime is serious, their business licenses will be withdrawn.
20925	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	In June, private brick kilns in north China's Shanxi Province were found abusing workers, many of whom were underage, in a forced labor scandal.

20928	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Most vocational schools in China take in students who finish three years in secondary school, but do not go to high school.
20929	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	In 2004, a private vocational school in southeast China's Jiangxi Province was caught luring first-year students to work full-time in an electronic hardware factory during their summer vacation by promising free tuition.

20936	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	The three areas are redesigning of global institutions, the globalization agenda, which should be an agenda of innovation but not of isolation or protectionism, and the environmental issue, especially climate change.
20937	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, he said the EU leaders also discussed the issue of stability of the EU financial market.

20941	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua)
20942	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Major global news media have continued to give prominence to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which closed here on Sunday.
20943	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Japan's Jiji News Agency and Kyodo News Service said China has shown its concerns about peoples lives by incorporating the "scientific outlook on development" into the party's constitution.
20944	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Jiji said the amendment of the party's constitution showed China is going to adjust its economic-growth-orientated policy, focus on building a harmonious society, pursue a sustainable and stable economic growth, narrow the gap between the rich and poor, better protect the environment and make its people more affluent.
20945	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Kyodo said raising the ratio in competitive elections to over eight percent in the preliminary election of the Central Committee has shown democracy within the party.
20946	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said in a report that the resolution adopted by the congress on the amendment to the CPC constitution to enshrine the "scientific outlook on development" was a milestone in the party's history and meant the focus of China's economic growth would shift from being growth- oriented to the realization of stability and distribution.
20947	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The "scientific outlook on development" values rational thinking.
20948	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	At it's core is putting people first and a basic requirement is balanced and sustainable development, the Yonhap report said.
20949	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This outlook aims to serve the people, to work for their well- being, and calls for development that benefits the people and is based on the notion that the fruits of growth should be shared by all, Yonhap said.
20950	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The outlook would be combined with the theory of building a harmonious society, which strives to solve problems such as the urban-rural gap, the rich-poor gap and unbalanced development and gives priority to environmental protection, Yonhap said.
20951	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP) ran updated stories on the election of the new Central Committee and the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, as well as the conclusion of the congress.
20952	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP said the result will determine how strong the leadership is "as it tries to ease tensions over a wide rich-poor gap at home and manage China's rising clout abroad."
20953	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP also reported that a revision to the party's constitution endorses "the scientific outlook on development," calling for increased social spending to help farmers and urban workers whose living standards have not risen as fast as many other Chinese.
20954	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Reuters said that the "scientific outlook of development" aims to "divert more prosperity to backward villages and poor workers" and to clean up fouled skies and waterways.
20955	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) also reported on the conclusion of the Congress and the insertion of the Scientific Outlook on Development into the party constitution.
20956	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The report cited General Secretary Hu Jintao as saying: "The scientific outlook on development takes development as its essence, putting people first as its core, and comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement."
20957	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The scientific outlook on development requires China to move towards more sustainable growth and create a "harmonious society" by reducing the economic inequalities that have resulted from the economic developments, the DPA report said.
20958	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The China Press newspaper, published in the United States, covered at length the closing of the 17th CPC National Congress.
20959	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	An editorial of the paper said people's livelihood has become "the core of China's future development."
20960	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	In Hu's report, China's economic growth was for the first time expressed in per capita terms rather than overall economic growth.
20961	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This was a sign that the focus of economic growth is not only on strengthening the economy, but more importantly on enriching the whole population and that any development must benefit the general public.
20962	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	"This is a strategic shift in China's outlook on development," the paper said.
20963	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Other international media such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Australian Associated Press and electronic and web news media of Singapore also issued reports on the closing of the CPC National Congress.

21026	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	THE HAGUE, Nov. 5 (Xinhua)
21027	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Developed and developing countries on Monday voiced different opinions over the way forward for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) after 10 years of its entry into force.
21028	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	At an annual conference of the CWC member states, developed countries called for rapid national implementation of the convention, while developing countries asked for access to technology and international cooperation in chemical industry.
21029	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"It is fundamental to ensure the removal of and to prevent the imposition of any discriminatory restriction on access to materials, equipment and technology required by developing states parties for their continued and peaceful development," said a joint statement of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and China.
21030	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"In this context, the NAM CWC states parties and China reiterate their call to developed countries to promote international cooperation through the transfer of technology, material and equipment for peaceful purposes in the chemical field and to remove all and any discriminatory restrictions," said the statement read by Oscar De Los Reyes Ramos, Cuba's permanent representative to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
21031	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	A European Union statement complained, however, about the slow pace of the implementation of Article VII of the CWC, which covers national implementation, including legislative and administrative measures.
21032	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"Full compliance with Article VII is a vital factor for the present and future efficiency of the CWC regime," said the statement read by Portuguese representative to the OPCW, Julio Mascarenhas.
21033	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Washington also expressed concern over the fact that a small number of countries have not taken "meaningful steps" to meet their obligations under Article VII.
21034	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"Article VII requires all states to implement the convention fully, which typically requires an array of laws, regulations and procedures," said U.S. permanent representative to the OPCW, Eric Javits, in a statement.
21035	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Consultations are under way for decisions on Article VII and Article XI at this year's conference, officials said.
21036	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Developed and developing countries agreed on universality of the CWC membership.
21037	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	They all urged those countries that have not joined the convention to do so without delay.
21038	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	So far 182 countries have become member states of the CWC, leaving only 13 outside.
21039	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The CWC is an international disarmament treaty which bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
21040	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The OPCW, with its headquarters in The Hague, is mandated to oversee the implementation of the chemical weapons treaty.
21041	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	In the past 10 years, a third of the world's declared stockpile of approximately 71,000 metric tons of chemical agent has been verifiably destroyed.
21042	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Albania became the first country in the world which has completed destruction of chemical weapons stockpile.
21043	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The annual conference is the decision-making body of the OPCW.
21044	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Last year's conference decided to postpone the deadline for the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles until April 2012.

21089	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	BEIRUT, Nov. 23 (Xinhua)
21090	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The deadline for Lebanese parliament to elect a new president is imminent on Friday, while uncertainty and doubt are running high as rival pro- and anti- Syrian politicians are still at odds on a compromise presidential candidate.
21091	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The parliament is scheduled to convene at 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) to pick a successor to replace pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud whose term ends at midnight.
21092	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The anti-Syrian ruling majority and pro-Syrian opposition have not strike a deal on a compromise candidate despite intensive international mediation, drawing speculations that Friday's session, which has been delayed for four times since September, might be postponed again.
21093	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Early in the morning, a crowd of journalists assembled outside the parliament building, waiting for parliamentarians to show up for the planned session.
21094	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	In downtown Beirut, usually bustling streets are quiet as the area where the parliament building is located was declared off- limits.
21095	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, vigilant soldiers, police and guards are heavily deployed along the street, with more armed vehicles and tanks at major intersections.
21096	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Under Lebanon's constitution, if no president is elected by the parliament in time limit, presidential powers pass to the government.
21097	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	But Lahoud has reiterated that he will not hand over the power to the government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora, which he considered as "illegitimate."
21098	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	According to the country's power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Maronite Christian and is elected by parliament rather than by popular votes.
21099	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	A two-thirds majority is required for a candidate to be elected by parliament in a first round of voting.
21100	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	In the event of a second round, a simple majority suffices.
21101	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The ruling coalition led by Saad Hariri enjoyed a slim majority in the 128-seat parliament by 68 seats against the opposition's 59.
21102	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	However, the assassinations targeting the lawmakers from the pro- government political bloc further dwindled the slight dominance.
21103	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Many fear that failure in reaching a deal on the presidential candidate could result in a power vacuum in the country or a split with two rival governments standing against one another.

21113	XIN_ENG_20071202.0295.LDC2009T13	The Primera Liga side said that specialist examination had revealed that the 30 -year-old suffers from a problem with the discs between several vertebrae in his lower back which provokes pain in his pelvis and upper leg.
21114	XIN_ENG_20071202.0295.LDC2009T13	Barcelona said Henry would follow a special programme of treatment to alleviate the pain and that it was expected he would be available to play again in around 15 days.
21115	XIN_ENG_20071202.0295.LDC2009T13	The former Arsenal player missed Barcelona's 2-2 draw with Olympique Lyon in midweek and their 1-1 draw against city rivals Espanyol on Saturday.

21118	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	KATHMANDU, Dec. 3 (Xinhua)
21119	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Physically disabled persons in Nepal have expressed dissatisfaction over current political deadlock in the country while marking the International Day of Disabled 2007 on Monday.
21120	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Various programs were organized throughout Nepal to celebrate the 16th International Disabled Day 2007 with the theme of Decent Work for People With Disabilities.
21121	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	However, the disabled persons in Nepal are yet to be convinced if they are going to get decent work opportunity at the time when the country is going through a total mess due to disagreement among political parties.
21122	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We expected representation from our community in the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) elections, but it seems like the political leaders have made up their mind to stick on with the interim parliament and keep on postponing the elections," said Chhaya Shrestha, one of the participants of the rally organized to mark the day told Xinhua.
21123	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Lamenting over current coalition government's apathy towards disabled persons, Chhaya criticized the government for failing to offer them any opportunity after democracy was restored in the country.
21124	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We hoped to see physically disabled persons representing us in CA elections but the current political deadlock has put us into doubt if the election is ever going to take place or not," Chhaya added.
21125	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"The politicians only limit proportional representation and inclusive democracy in their speech," she added.
21126	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Similarly, there are thousands of people, who became physically disabled after losing their limbs and body parts during a decade long insurgency, still languishing for government's attention.
21127	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to Association for Injured and Disabled Combatant of the People's War, a sister organization of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M) expressed disappointment over government's indifference towards the country's disabled people.
21128	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to the association's data, some 2,000 CPN-M combatants who were disabled during the decade long people's conflict are not getting enough attention from the government.
21129	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Central member of the association Chitra Bahadur Gharti, who lost his right hand during the conflict, told Xinhua that some of the party cadres who lost their limbs and body parts during the conflict are currently languishing in seven different United Nations cantonments while those who can still provide assistance are still deployed in the field to carry out various party works.
21130	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We feel that the welfare of disabled persons is possible only through the restructuring of the state," said Gharti, adding that the main objective of the party would be to provide health, education and employment to the disabled persons.
21131	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He added that the CPN-M is providing skill oriented training to the disabled cadres at the cantonments.
21132	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, speaking at a program organized to mark the day, Speaker Subash Nembang stressed the need for Nepal to be a party to the United Nations (UN) Convention on Disability by ratifying it.
21133	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal (OHCHR- Nepal) Chief Richard Bennet also called on Nepali government to promptly ratify the convention.
21134	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He said so far 118 nations have ratified the convention and requested 13 countries including Nepal to ratify it.
21135	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Bennett noted, the majority of people with disabilities live in conditions of poverty, adding that "Access to decent work is the key to breaking that poverty trap, while the self sufficiency that work with fair pay and conditions brings enhances the dignity of the worker and contributes to the entire society and economy."
21136	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to a press release issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO), of an estimated 650 million disabled people in the world, approximately 470 million are of working age.
21137	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"There is a strong link between disability and poverty," the ILO report says.
21138	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	Togo unions to review elections procedures
21139	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	LOME, Dec. 5 (Xinhua)
21140	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	Delegates drawn from Togolese various unions Wednesday begun reviewing the necessary methods of conducting credible social elections to ensure the formation of representative unions in the country, according to reports.
21141	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	It is necessary to organize the Togolese union landscape more efficiently as it currently experiencing leadership problems with multiple unions lacking cohesion, said the unionists.
21142	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	"We are making efforts aimed at creating perfect conditions to determine the rate of representation for each organization, for better cooperation and good management of professional relations in Togo," they said.
21143	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	For varied reasons and contradictory action by unions, problems afflicting Togolese workers have not been addressed in a concerted manner, notably the situation of nearly 3,000 casual workers in the public service which has never been given the attention it deserves to ensure their full integration, affirmed the unionists.
21144	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	Togolese Public Service Minister Foli-Bazi Katari said the government will support "any efforts deployed to prevent leadership squabbles experienced by a number of unions in the country."
21145	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	He warned that only those more representative unions are authorized, among others, to negotiate and sign collective agreements, and to appoint representatives in lawful bodies, including the national council for social and economic dialogue.

21147	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
21148	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The former board chairman of the Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being convicted on five counts of corruption, including bribery.
21149	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Under a final ruling handed down on Tuesday by the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City, Jilin Province, Zhang Xiaoguang was found guilty of taking bribes, corruption, embezzlement of public funds, illegally seeking private interest on behalf of relatives, and possessing major assets for which he could not account, the Beijing News reported.
21150	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	In addition to his convictions, Zhang was also stripped of political rights for life and all his personal property was confiscated.
21151	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The five counts involved 50 million yuan, but there was no breakdown for each count.
21152	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	According to the newspaper, Zhang's case is believed to be connected with another incident in which Gao Shan, former head of a branch of the Bank of China (BOC) on Hesong Street in Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, allegedly siphoned 1 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to Canada.
21153	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite Gao, who fled after sending the funds to Canada in 2005, and another suspect, Li Dongzhe.
21154	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	They are currently under the surveillance of Canadian police.
21155	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's case was a complex one, the newspaper reported, as shown by the 36-page court verdict that ran to nearly 30,000 Chinese characters.
21156	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of misappropriating public funds.
21157	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd, a publicly listed company, said two days later in a public announcement that 293 million yuan of its funds were missing from the BOC's Hesong Street Branch.
21158	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterwards, Gao, chief of the branch, was discovered to have fled overseas.
21159	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's first trial commenced at the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City in September 2006.
21160	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	However, it was soon called off at the request of public prosecutors for further investigation, following the detention of Dong Fang, former general manager of Donggao Science and Technologies Oils Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Northeast Expressway, who reportedly gave Zhang 10 million yuan in bribes.
21161	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.
21162	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang pleaded innocent in the BOC case in a second trial held in January this year.
21163	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Roundup: Bali conference in full swing, still bumpy road ahead
21164	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	BALI, Indonesia, Dec. 11 (Xinhua)
21165	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
21166	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Contact groups and informal consultations continued Tuesday as United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined the discussions here on Tuesday morning to add to voices for global actions on climate change.
21167	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference is the need for quantified national emission targets for industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the next 10-15 years.
21168	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The IPCC suggests that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the range of 25-40 percent by 2020 is necessary in order to keep the earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsus.
21169	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
21170	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
21171	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted by enthusiastic applause.
21172	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	In a daily press briefing on Tuesday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer hailed the agreement as "encouraging".
21173	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed on Monday how the Adaptation Fund will operate, including its governing body, functions, secretariat, trustee and other institutional arrangements.
21174	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an interim arrangement up for review every three years was a surprise to me," says one observer.
21175	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"I think most of us are delighted to have finalized the Fund whether you like the precise details or not," adds another.
21176	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with regard to developing countries.
21177	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
21178	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
21179	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to.
21180	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
21181	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will deliver a statement at the opening of the High-Level segment on Wednesday and the segment is due to end on Friday.
21182	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	During these last three days of the conference, Environment Ministers will seek to reach agreement on the shape of a future international climate pact, the so- called " Bali roadmap".
21183	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United Nations Climate Change Conference opened on the Indonesian island on Dec. 3.

21186	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	World number one Wang Hao dashed the last hope of none-Chinese players, ousting Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus here on Saturday to make the men's singles semifinals of the ITTF ProTour Finals all- Chinese encounters.
21187	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"It's a really tough game for me.
21188	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	I had my chance at the beginning, but Wang played better.
21189	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	It's natural he win the match," said the 31-year-old Samsonov.
21190	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"Both of us have good performance," said Wang, who won an Olympic final rematch against Ryu Seung Min of South Korea to make the quarters.
21191	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"Samsonov and Ryu are among the top players in the world and it's a good opportunity for me to face them here and beat them."
21192	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	Samsonov, who has never claimed a world championship but won three European top honors and two World Cups, saw a possible turning point in the third set as he earned three set point on 10-7 and denied Wang's late comeback to win it 15-13.
21193	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	The former leading one in Europe's "Good Time", however, has been ousted from the main group of world top class table tennis, succumbed to the world number one Chinese 11-9, 11-5, 13-15, 11-9, 11-7.
21194	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"I lost my distraction when leading 10-4 in the fourth set, but I tried to put myself together and turned back to the winning way, " said the 24-year-old Wang.
21195	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the evening, Wang's national teammates Ma Lin and Ma Long beat Germany's Timo Boll and Singapore's Yang Zi for the semis, while Wang Liqin came out the winner of an all-Chinese quarterfinal against younger Chen Qi.

21203	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh is eyeing to install its first nuclear power plant by 2015 to meet the country's mounting electricity demand, as the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) has responded positively to its installation plan.
21204	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	"The IAEA's response received recently was found to be very positive towards installation of a nuclear power plant," Energy and Power Adviser Tapan Chowdhury was quoted by local newspaper The Finance Express as saying on Tuesday.

21206	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Tapan Chowdhury said the IAEA, the global nuclear watchdog, also asked Bangladesh to send a delegation to expedite the process of installing a nuclear power plant with its assistance.
21207	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh submitted the work plan to the IAEA last October, giving details on how the country planned to install the nuclear power plant at Rooppur and maintain safeguards with proper management of wastes.
21208	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	The IAEA was pleased with the government commitment for setting up the nuclear power plant, selection of the project site and assurance of utilizing the plant for peaceful purposes, a senior Power Division official said.

21227	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	A reward of 280,000 yuan has been granted to reporters since last Spring Festival and a total of 106 people involved in 95 cases have been arrested, according to local government.
21228	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Beijing tightened control over illegal firecracker production this year by launching a crackdown on substandard firecracker workshops throughout the city.
21229	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Checkpoints have been set up at entrances of every major highways into Beijing to cut the supply of illegal firecrackers, the official said.
21230	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The officer also said firecracker watchdogs will keep a close eye on the online black markets, which have emerged recently.
21231	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The three major fireworks companies in Beijing joined hands to fight against fake firecrackers by cutting prices and setting up a special fund for the crackdown on illegal firework production.
21232	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Fireworks are part of traditional celebrations marking the Chinese Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls on Feb. 7 this year.

21235	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
21236	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	With world bullion prices hitting new highs, gold futures made a strong debut on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) on Wednesday.
21237	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract offers China a chance to become a key player in the global gold market.
21238	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It could also be a hedging tool for gold producers and a means to absorb excess liquidity, analysts said.
21239	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The key contract for June delivery was the first to take off, surging 9.98 percent to 230.95 yuan (about 31.65 U.S. dollars) per gram.
21240	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	This was followed by the daily limit rise of other contracts for July-to-December delivery.
21241	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Seven contracts were traded, with the benchmark price set at 209.99 yuan per gram by the SFE a day earlier, lower than world prices.
21242	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract size was set at 1,000 grams, larger than the originally expected 300 grams, to discourage individual investors who lacked the ability to handle the risk.
21243	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Analysts said they believed investors would need at least 24,000 yuan to secure a futures contract, as most futures brokers would ask for a 12 percent cash deposit for each contract.
21244	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The most active June contract closed the first trading day at 223.3 yuan per gram, up 6.34 percent, with a turnover of 23.2 billion yuan, according to the SFE website.
21245	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The total turnover of the seven contracts was registered at more than 27 billion yuan for the day.
21246	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	All futures contracts finished the day higher, between 223 yuan and 228 yuan, slipping slightly after peaking at 230.99 yuan.
21247	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.
21248	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Global prices jumped more than 30 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979.
21249	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold prices climbed more than 2 percent on Tuesday against strong oil prices and a weakening U.S. currency.
21250	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	A troy ounce of gold for February delivery added 18.3 U.S. dollars to settle at 880.30 U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
21251	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the launch of gold futures trading.
21252	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
21253	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE, one of China's major futures trading venues, previously traded copper, aluminum, zinc, natural rubber and fuel futures.
21254	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said that gold futures could provide experience for the long- awaited launch of stock index futures.
21255	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Live pig futures will also be launched to help stabilize pork prices.
21256	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	HEDGING PRICES VS INVESTMENT TOOLS
21257	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Shang Fulin, CSRC chairman, stressed the financial nature of the precious metal and called for "joint efforts for the stable operation" of the new product at the launching ceremony in Shanghai.
21258	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said gold futures would improve the country's domestic gold market and pricing mechanism and provide options for financial institutions, gold producers and consumers to protect against market risk.
21259	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also further develop the nascent futures industry.
21260	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Most new futures investors would be institutions seeking a hedging tool," said Zhang Yingying, a Galaxy Futures Broker gold analyst.
21261	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	So far, however, the SFE has listed only four members for futures trading, all of which are large Chinese gold producers.
21262	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	She said, "the contract size could limit participation by individual investors, but in the long run both institutions and individuals would play an equal role."
21263	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zhao Yuanlin, a Guotai Jun'an Futures analyst, said the brokerage had received numerous inquiries about gold futures from individual stock investors recently.
21264	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.
21265	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, "I would first offer risk education to veteran stock investors, since even they lacked the experience for riskier futures trading," Zhao told Xinhua.
21266	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Chinese investors, who saw the key stock index nearly double last year, have shown strong enthusiasm for the new investment product.
21267	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, the regulators were trying to discourage such clients, fearing that some might take on risks they couldn't handle.
21268	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE said earlier that it would impose strict risk controls on gold futures.
21269	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also set a minimum margin requirement of 7 percent of the contract value.
21270	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
21271	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, CSRC said individuals would be barred from taking physical delivery of gold in futures trading and could buy bullion only from banks or the spot market.
21272	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	RISING STAR IN WORLD MARKET?
21273	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"The trading volume of Chinese futures would likely expand quickly and could soon rank top among global exchanges, even outstripping NYMEX in the long run," a senior official at the exchange told Xinhua's International Herald Leader reporter.
21274	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zheng Xueqin, a Chicago Board Options Exchange senior counselor, agreed that "Shanghai could emerge as the third center of world gold trade, after New York and London."
21275	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said, "the SFE would first become a center for Asian trade, given the country's large reserves and consumption and the traditional Chinese love of gold."
21276	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Hong Kong and Tokyo were two major Asian trading centers.
21277	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Domestic analysts expressed confidence about the contract's prospects, citing robust investment registered in simulated trade between Jan. 2-8.
21278	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China was the world's third largest gold producer in 2006 after South Africa and the United States.
21279	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold consumption by the country's manufacturing sector was about 9.2 percent of the global total, according to official data.
21280	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Sun Zhaoxue, China Gold Association head, said on Wednesday that the country's gold output reached 270 tons in 2007, only 20 tons short of South Africa, the world's largest producer.
21281	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	LIQUIDITY ABSORBER
21282	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Gold futures could also provide a reservoir to absorb the country's excess liquidity, a major concern of the government amid the anticipated strong appreciation of the currency, which had already pushed asset prices up," said Zheng Runxiang, a senior gold investment analyst.
21283	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said that the new futures market could thus help the country's tighter monetary policy and alleviate inflation pressure.
21284	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Trade at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the country's spot market, was 1,828 tons last year, with a total value of 316.5 billion yuan.
21285	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Based on that figure, Zheng said, the futures market could hit 10.5 trillion yuan, because international experience showed that futures trade was usually 33 times spot trade.
21286	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The estimated figure would exceed the combined market capitalization of the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

21290	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	Kosovo's prime minister-designate Hashim Thaci on Wednesday named new cabinet members, including Jakup Krasniqi of his Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) as new parliament speaker, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
21291	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	Thaci also named Hajredin Kuqi of the PDK, and Rame Manaj of coalition partners Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) as his deputy prime ministers.
21292	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	The names of the proposed cabinet will be submitted to the 120-seat Kosovo Parliament for adoption once it reconvenes, about two months from the PDK's victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections on Nov. 17, Thaci said.
21293	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	As the PDK leader, Thaci signed a power-sharing agreement on Monday to form a coalition with opposition LDK leader, Fatmir Sejdiu.
21294	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	According to the proposal, the ministries will be distributed as follows: seven ministers from the PDK, five from the LDK, one from the Kosovo Turk Democratic Party, while two posts will go to Serb officials.
21295	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	Kosovo has been run by the UN administration since NATO bombing drove the Serbian forces out of the ethnic Albanian dominated province in 1999.
21296	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	Following failed talks between Belgrade and Pristina on the future status of the province, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders have pledged to unilaterally declare independence in early 2008, but the move is unlikely before Jan. 20, the date for presidential elections in Serbia.
21297	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	The United States and a number of European countries are expected to recognize Kosovo's independence, but Serbia and its ally Russia said they would oppose any such move.

21390	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Rising food prices continue to threaten South Africa's household food security, the National Agricultural Marketing Council said on Thursday.
21391	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Senior economist Tema Nkgasha Pieter said although food prices had risen at a slower rate in January compared to December, from January 2007 to January 2008 the Consumer Price Index for Food was 13.4 percent.
21392	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The good news is that this is 0.1 percent lower than the CPI- Food reported in December 2007 that showed a year-on-year increase of 13.5 percent," he said.
21393	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Food categories making the largest contribution to this increase include grain products, milk, cheese and eggs, fats and oils, fruits and nuts and vegetables.
21394	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Staple food items continue to increase at a relatively high rate.
21395	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Brown bread increased at 16.21 percent and white bread at 19.
21396	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	92 percent year-on-year.
21397	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The prices of a 5-kg bag of super and special maize meal increased by 22.29 percent and 28.00 percent respectively, year- on- year.
21398	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The price of diary products on average increased by about a third, and vegetable products by just over a third.
21399	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other food products.
21400	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events," said Pieter.
21401	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity prices would remain high but stable.
21402	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this situation however.
21403	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Consumers were becoming risk averse because of pessimism around economic growth.
21404	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food was expected to decline.
21405	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Pieter said the steep rise in food prices could potentially decelerate.
21406	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure, favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and livestock markets.

21511	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon reiterated on Tuesday that the UN mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, will continue to operate in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244.
21512	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, UNMIK continues to operate on the understanding that resolution 1244 ( 1999) remains in force, unless the Security Council decides otherwise," Ban said in his latest report on the work of UNMIK to the Security Council.
21513	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The secretary-general said Kosovo's declaration of independence and subsequent events have posed significant challenges to UNMIK's ability to exercise its administrative authority in Kosovo.

21516	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."

21523	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Two suspects were arrested for their alleged involvement in two arson cases in the recent Lhasa riots which led to the deaths of two innocent victims, China's Ministry of Public Security said here on Tuesday.

21525	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	"Both suspects have confessed to their crimes," said ministry spokesman Wu Heping.
21526	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Around 2 p.m. on March 14, Tanzen allegedly participated in such criminal activities as randomly assaulting passersby, vandalizing properties, looting and arson in the neighborhood of Duosengge Road in the Tibetan capital.
21527	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He set fire to several shops and used a lighter to burn pants in a garment store named Playboy.
21528	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The fire killed the shop owner's 20-year-old daughter, Liu Juan, Wu said.
21529	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	On the same day, Losang Gyaltsen set fire to a pants store called Hongyu on the Youth Road in Lhasa.
21530	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	His actions caused the death of 45-year-old shop owner Zuo Rencun.
21531	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Losang Gyaltsen also collaborated with others in looting and burning an outlet of the garment brand Metersbonwe and a Snow Spider shoe store.
21532	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Wu said an investigation of the two was still underway.
21533	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The ministry has now made public four deadly arson cases -- those in a Yishion outlet, a motorcycle shop, the Playboy garment store and the Hongyu pants store -- that led to the deaths of 12 civilians.
21534	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	According to the ministry spokesman, apart from the cases already known to the public, six more people were found to have been killed in the March 14 riots.
21535	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	They are:
21536	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He Jianshu, male, 60, Han ethnic group, from the southwest Sichuan Province
21537	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Lhapa Tsering, male, 30, Tibetan ethnic group, from Lhasa, Tibet.

21542	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	To date, the deadly riot has claimed the lives of 18 civilians and one police officer.
21543	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
21544	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
21545	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He said that police have captured the primary suspects who allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on March 14 in Lhasa.
21546	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	"The suspects are closely connected with the Dalai clique," he said.
21547	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique, Wu revealed.

21605	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	DAKAR, May 3 (Xinhua)
21606	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The time is not ripe for France to disengage itself from the African continent, said Alain Joyandet, France's secretary of state for Cooperation and French- Speaking countries.
21607	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Joyandet stressed that the moment is right for the country "to consolidate its waning presence" in the African continent.
21608	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"This is not the time to leave Africa" because "the time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa is now," Joyandet was quoted as telling reporters shortly after arriving in Dakar on Friday.
21609	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"Competition from Asian countries and the oil-rich emirates is a new element that must be taken into account.
21610	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	There are a number of countries that were not interested in Africa, but who are now beginning to show keen interest," said Joyandet, who is in the Senegalese capital for an official visit.
21611	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"In the decades ahead, the major changes that will take place in economic terms will probably be here in Africa," said the French official.
21612	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"If there is a time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa, it is now.
21613	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	For it is now that we should be laying the foundation for what will happen within the next 20 years," said Joyandet.
21614	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"Not only is this not the time to leave... but the president ( Nicolas Sarkozy) has asked me to spend most of my time looking into African issues.
21615	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	This goes to underscore the determination of France," said he, adding that "there was no question of going back. "
21616	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The remarks by the senior French official are coming at a time when analysts both inside and outside Africa are wondering whether France will pursue a policy of continuity with Africa or "a new break" as promised by President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of his electoral triumph.
21617	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Asked for comments, Joyandet, who replaced the outspoken Jean- Marie Bockel who openly criticized old-style ties with Africa, replied laconically that his aim is to lead to "the modernization of the existing relations between France and Africa."
21618	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Addressing French nationals residing in Senegal in the presence of the ambassadorr Jean-Christophe Rufin, Joyandet took time to stress the benefits of the existing ties, including economic ones, between France and Senegal.
21619	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"Over 25,000 French citizens live and work in Senegal, where one of the largest French communities in sub-Saharan Africa is founded," said the French diplomat.
21620	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The turnover of French subsidiaries and companies accounted for 25 percent of Senegal's gross domestic product (GDP), said he, adding that the companies contributed nearly 28 percent of tax revenues, besides employing 15,000 people.
21621	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	In terms of Official Development Assistance, "Senegal is the country that receives the largest share of France's aid in sub- Saharan Africa," said the French official ahead of a meeting with Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade.

21623	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua)
21624	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton continued the battle to win the Democratic presidential nomination, with record turnouts in the North Carolina and Indiana primaries Tuesday.
21625	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Voters lined up before sunrise in the capital of the midwestern state of Indiana, where the first polling stations opened at 6:00 am (1100 GMT) under overcast skies.
21626	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The day's voting closes in North Carolina at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT), with a combined total of 187 pledged delegates on offer in the two states.
21627	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Pre-election polls showed Obama leading in North Carolina while Clinton appeared to have the edge in Indiana.
21628	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Judging by numbers, Obama is the Democratic front-runner so far, as he leads in pledged delegates and is also ahead in the popular vote.
21629	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	However, he has also been unable to force Clinton out of the race.
21630	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	If Obama can take both states, he will strengthen his advantage over Clinton and influence the superdelegates who will ultimately decide who will represent the Democratic Party in November's presidential election.
21631	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Clinton needs to at least take Indiana to stay in the race.
21632	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The Clinton camp admits she cannot overtake Obama in pledged delegate count, and is therefore pinning her hopes on persuading nearly 800 superdelegates, who look set to have the deciding vote, to choose her as the presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention in August.
21633	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	A rolling average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com gives Obama 1,491 pledged delegates from all the races so far to Clinton's 1,337.
21634	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Neither can reach the winning line of 2,025 without backing from the superdelegates -- party officials free to vote either way.
21635	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	North Carolina and Indiana will also hold Republican presidential primaries Tuesday.
21636	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, is expected to pull in the majority of votes in what will be relatively light turnouts for Republicans.

21645	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Plague could break out in quake-hit areas if victims' bodies were not buried soon, a local official told Xinhua on Thursday.
21646	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Many bodies are trapped in debris and heavy-lifting gear cannot get through blocked roads to the disaster areas, said Bai Licheng, a senior Communist Party official of the Aba prefecture in Sichuan Province.
21647	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Since the destructive earthquake on Monday, Bai has been searching for survivors with a rescue team in Yingxiu of Wenchuan County, epicenter of the quake.
21648	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	High temperatures would quicken the rotting of bodies, and plague would break out, he warned.
21649	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Some bodies are put together on the ground in the town, and there is already bad smell in the air.
21650	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We are in urgent need of body bags," Bai said, adding there is an urgent need for food and water.
21651	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"Air-dropped food and drinking water are limited and far from meeting the demand," he said.
21652	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said some survivors have fetched water from a mountain spring, but it is unclear if the water is safe for drinking.
21653	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	On Thursday afternoon, Gao Qiang, deputy health minister, vowed that the central government aims to prevent the outbreak of large-scale epidemic.
21654	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said the bodies of the dead would be handled properly as soon as possible to prevent harmful bacteria from growing.
21655	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We should not add to the losses caused by natural disasters and let people suffer more just because we have not done our job well," said Gao.

21843	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	Brazil thus advanced to the finals with an unbeaten record from Group C, and would take on Cameroon in their quarterfinal match.
21844	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	The loss of China was the fourth consecutive time that the Olympic host countries failed to progress to the knockout stage.
21845	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	Brazil's first goal came in the 18th minute into the match.
21846	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	Alves Diego ran after a through pass by Ronaldinho, and avoided Chinese goalkeeper Liu Zhenli on their one-on-one encounter before he coolly sent the ball into the empty net.
21847	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	In the 68th minute, Han Peng, a usual striker but played a defensive position in today's match, received a yellow card after pulling down Brazil's striker Sobis Rafael.
21848	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	Brazil's Neves Thiago then extended their lead in the awarded free kick with his left-foot shot.
21849	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	The goalkeeper Liu didn't make any response to the shot.
21850	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	In the 73rd minute, Thiago again enlarged the victory with a left-foot low shot from outside the penalty box.
21851	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"China should have played more aggressively in front of their home crowds," Brazilian head coach, Dunga, said at the post-match press conference.
21852	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	He was a key defensive midfielder for the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 World Cup.
21853	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	The only threat from the Chinese side came in the 37th minute in the first half, when Jiang Ning dodged Brazil's defenders and struck from the left side of the penalty box, but his effort was warded off by defender Silva Thiago's outstretched right foot.
21854	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"This is not a normal match for us, as three of our four defenders were suspended due to yellow-card accumulations and red-card suspensions," Chinese head coach Yin Tiesheng said.
21855	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"Indeed our players are far behind the Brazilians in terms of techniques, tactics as well as physical abilities.
21856	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	We just wanted to give them more punches and pressures, and I believe we already did it," he said.
21857	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"If we could finish our shots better, we could have threatened their goalmouth," he said.
21858	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	After three group matches, China got only 1 point and stood at the bottom in the group.
21859	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"I don't want to make any excuses for our loss," Chinese captain Li Weifeng said.
21860	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"This is the end of our Olympic tournament, but this is not the end of our football."
21861	XIN_ENG_20080813.0595.LDC2009T13	"I hope we could give more tolerances and time to Chinese football, so that our younger players would play better in the future," he said.

21863	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	VIENNA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua)
21864	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	The weekly average prices of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) slightly rebounded to 111.08 U.S.dollars per barrel (dpb) last week, 1.35 dollars higher than the previous week, said the Vienna-based cartel Monday.
21865	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	The weekly prices dropped in a row for 6 consecutively trading weeks since it topped historic high of 138.31 dpb on the first week of July.
21866	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	It once touched the three-month-low of 109.73 dollars the week before last week.
21867	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	The daily average prices last week slightly dropped to 108.26 dollars Tuesday and started jumping higher.

21869	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	As the main reason for the recent rebounding, some analysts attributed it to concerns on the further cooling relationship between Russia and western countries due to the South Ossetia conflict.
21870	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	In comparison with the "cold war," some experts also mentioned the U.S-deployed missiles in Poland and the Russia's strong reaction on this issue last week, saying it would deepen the international concerns on the geopolitical crisis and stimulate the oil prices rebounding higher.
21871	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	Moreover, OPEC's senior officials said lately that the oil supply was more than enough.
21872	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	Venezuela's energy minister Rafael Rmirez said last Friday that "there is plenty of oil in the market" and indicated that the OPEC should consider cutting output at the upcoming September meeting if the recent prices drop led to a sustained downturn.
21873	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the profit taking in the commodity market and the recovery in the U.S. dollars also helped the prices go back to a higher place.
21874	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	It showed also that the short-term bottom of the prices had been touched, said experts.

21881	XIN_ENG_20080826.0200.LDC2009T13	Last week it condemned the Russian operation in Georgia and supported Georgian elected officials.
21882	XIN_ENG_20080826.0200.LDC2009T13	Topolanek said that the Czech Republic supports the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia, including South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

21967	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The six spacemen now had moved to their special accommodation to be quarantined and to adjust their psychological conditions for the mission.
21968	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The Long-March II-F rocket, developed in 1992, is said to be the most complicated and reliable carrier rocket in China's aviation history with all its launch mission successfully finished.
21969	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	So far the rocket had sent two manned spacecraft and four unmanned into space.
21970	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	Since October 1996, the Long-March series rockets have successfully launched for 108 times.
21971	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The Shenzhou-7 project will be its 109th mission.
21972	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	According to Jin Muchun, chief rocket system designer of the mission, the Long- March II-F will be given a thorough upgrade after sending the Shenzhou-7.
21973	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"The upgrading work will be finished by two steps," Jin told Xinhua.
21974	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"all its technical parameters and designs will be replaced."
21975	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	According to Jin, the first step will make the rocket lighter, smaller, more powerful and more integrated by improving its controlling and guiding parts and electronic devices.
21976	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The second step will change the fuel of the rocket, replacing its current combustion-supporting material by a new generation of full liquid oxygen.
21977	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	On April 12, China launched a new space tracking ship to serve the Shenzhou-7 spacewalk mission.
21978	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The new ship and its sister, Yuanwang-5 which was put into use a year ago, will play a key role in monitoring and controlling the Shenzhou-7 mission.
21979	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	China successfully put two manned spacecraft into orbit in 2003 and 2005, respectively, becoming the third country to send an astronaut into space after the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia).

22008	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (Xinhua)
22009	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Representatives from the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany will soon discuss the settlement of Iran's nuclear issue via telephone, a U. S. official said here Wednesday.
22010	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Officials of the six countries will consult possible action by the United Nations Security Council to stop Iran's sensitive nuclear work, said the official who asked not to be identified.

22012	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Senior officials from the six countries discussed in mid- September over possible new sanctions against Iran as Tehran refuses to comply with United Nations resolutions.

22017	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	News Analysis: Financial crisis sends eurozone economy to brink of recession
22018	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Oct. 9 (Xinhua)
22019	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The eurozone economy is now on the brink of recession as the financial crisis is devastating the 15-nation bloc sharing the euro currency.
22020	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	For the first time, economic growth in the eurozone recorded a quarterly decrease in the three months from April to June this year, figures from the European Union (EU)'s statistics bureau Eurostat showed Wednesday.
22021	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	But things have been getting worse after the negative growth in the second quarter, mainly due to the escalating financial crisis, which suggests that there is little chance of the eurozone economy rebounding in the following months.
22022	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In technical terms, recession means negative growth in two consecutive quarters.
22023	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	As EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday, forecasts of a recession in Europe and the United States could become the "central scenario."
22024	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Forecasts for recessions on both sides of the Atlantic "run the risk of becoming the central scenario in the coming months," Almunia told a conference in Madrid, Spain.
22025	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The financial crisis, which originated in the United States, has deepened in Europe in recent weeks, with several European banks falling prey to the global credit crunch, prompting EU governments to save their banks by injecting large amounts of money or even nationalizing them.
22026	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Without any knowledge of which one would be the next victim, financial institutions in the eurozone have become extremely reluctant to lend to each other, resulting in a more serious credit crunch.
22027	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Despite furious efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject liquidity into the financial markets, no big turn was observed.
22028	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Economists fear that a prolonged money market freeze would have a significant impact on overall lending to businesses and individuals, undermining confidence and threatening the real economy.
22029	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Figures from the European Commission showed that economic confidence in the eurozone continued to fall in September, hitting the lowest level since November 2001, i.e. shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, while the business climate decreased significantly to values last observed in 2003.
22030	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Last month, Almunia warned that the financial crisis is hurting Europe's real economy.
22031	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"There can be no doubt that events in the financial sector are hurting the real economy," he told a European Parliament plenary session.
22032	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Almunia said the effects of the financial turmoil have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and the severe housing market corrections in some EU member states.
22033	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"This combination of shocks has impacted directly on economic activity via higher costs and negative wealth effects and indirectly via a sharp erosion of economic confidence," he said.
22034	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"The result has been a break on domestic demand at a time when external demand is fading," he added.
22035	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	With the threat of the financial crisis on one side, the eurozone economy also faced inflation which remained stubbornly high at 3.6 percent.
22036	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Frankfurt-based ECB prefers a ceiling of 2 percent to maintain price stability.
22037	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	High inflation erodes purchasing power of every family, dampening private consumption, a key driver behind eurozone economic growth.
22038	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Official figures showed that consumption expenditure, investment and exports, the three major economic engines in the eurozone, all cooled down in the second quarter, decreasing from the previous three months by 0.2, 1.0 and 0.2 percent respectively.
22039	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Among large members in the eurozone, Germany, France and Italy, which together make up two thirds of the eurozone gross domestic product, all reported a quarterly drop in the second quarter.
22040	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	So far, Ireland and France have fallen into recession.
22041	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Analysts warned that with no sign of recovery, recession is just around the corner for the eurozone.
22042	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Early September, the European Commission revised down its forecast for eurozone economic growth this year by 0.4 percentage points to 1.3 percent.
22043	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	At that time, it was stressed that risks to the growth outlook were on the downside.
22044	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Commission said the dramatic events in the financial markets in the last few weeks are reinforcing that view.
22045	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In an emergent bid to restore confidence and avoid an economic crash, the ECB abandoned its long-time hawkish policy of refusing to lower its interest rate and joined hands with the world's major central banks Wednesday by cutting its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage points.

22050	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	They were all accused of poor management and surveillance after 450 people were poisoned by drinking water containing arsenic.
22051	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Residents from two villages began showing symptoms like swelling in the face and eyes, vomiting and blurred vision Oct. 3.
22052	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Doctors said all patients are in stable condition and are recovering.
22053	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Environmental testing showed the villages' water source was polluted by industrial waste discharged from Jinhai Metallurgy Chemical, a branch of the state-owned Liuzhou China Tin Co. Ltd. based in Guangxi's Liuzhou City.
22054	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	The Hechi government said the plant illegally discharged waste and got away with it because of the Environmental Protection Bureau's poor surveillance.
22055	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	The city government suspended operation at the plant and ordered the company to pay for all the victims hospital bills.

22058	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday the plan of direct U.S. stake in banks is focused on regulated firms, indicating unregulated firms such as hedge funds won't initially get government aid.
22059	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"We're focused on financial institutions, regulated financial institutions," Paulson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, when asked whether hedge funds might also be eligible.
22060	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"The program right now is for banks and thrifts," he was quoted as saying.
22061	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	Banking strains have hurt broader economic growth, pushing the United States toward a recession.
22062	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"There's been a shock in the credit markets, and that's exacted a toll on the real economy," said Paulson.
22063	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that the U.S. economy faces "a number of tough months" ahead.
22064	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	In a separate interview on Fox Business Network, Paulson insisted the Bush Administration is pursuing the correct course now to end the debacle.
22065	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"We will mitigate the impact on the real economy and we'll get this financial system working again," he said.

22178	XIN_ENG_20081124.0160.LDC2009T13	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday he was satisfied with the massive participation of his compatriots in the municipal and regional elections.
22179	XIN_ENG_20081124.0160.LDC2009T13	Chavez called on the electors to stay calm and trust the results to be announced by the Electoral National Council.
22180	XIN_ENG_20081124.0160.LDC2009T13	"It is impossible to make a fraud in Venezuela," Chavez said, adding that the transparency of the electoral system of the country has been verified by domestic and foreign experts.

22190	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders issued a special statement on the financial crisis Saturday, vowing to take action "individually and collectively" to restore confidence in their economies and keep the region moving along the path of long-term growth.
22191	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We have already taken urgent and extraordinary steps to stabilize our financial sectors and strengthen economic growth and promote investment and consumption," the statement said.
22192	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to take such steps and work closely, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner, to implement future actions to address this crisis," it added.
22193	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders specifically pledged support for efforts by export credit agencies, international financial institutions and private banks to ensure that adequate finance is available to businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and to keep trade and investment flowing in the region.
22194	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	They also welcomed continued development and innovation in the financial sector, while calling for more effective regulatory and supervisory tools as financial systems become more complex.
22195	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The APEC leaders also expressed support for the Washington Declaration adopted at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month and the common principles that will guide the Action Plan for financial markets reform.
22196	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As one of the world's biggest regional blocs with a wide geographical span and huge diversity among its members, APEC has sent a strong signal that world economies are ready to do everything possible to stave off the crisis and restore market confidence, analysts say.

22198	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	During the meeting, the leaders highlighted the urgency to curb any upturn of protectionism that could arise from the crisis and exacerbate the current economic situation.
22199	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders reiterated their "firm belief that free market principles, and open trade and investment regimes will continue to drive global growth, employment and poverty reduction."
22200	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, they promised not to raise new barriers to investment and trade in the next 12 months.
22201	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We...will refrain within the next 12 months from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services, imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent measures in all areas, including those that stimulate exports," the statement said.
22202	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On the Doha round of trade talks, APEC leaders expressed their hope for "an ambitious and balanced conclusion" to lay the foundation for the economic growth and prosperity in the region.
22203	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We are committed to reach agreement on modalities next month on the basis of progress made to date," they added.
22204	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The strong call by the leaders for free trade and rejection of protectionism indicates that world economies are determined to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s when "a wrong approach" was taken, as U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said.
22205	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
22206	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	One of the highlights of the APEC Leaders' Week from Nov. 16-23 was the leaders' efforts to explore the social dimension of APEC, especially corporate social responsibility, amid the crisis.
22207	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"The crisis also highlights the need to develop more effective standards of corporate governance and risk management as well as the importance of social responsibility in the financial sector," the statement said.
22208	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders urged companies to incorporate social responsibility into their business strategies to take account of social, labor and environmental concerns.
22209	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	Such a move is likely to boost confidence among investors and consumers who have accused some companies of a reckless pursuit of profits, which triggered the financial meltdown, analysts say.
22210	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	However, it remains to be seen how companies across the world can promote the practice "on a voluntary basis" as stated in the Lima Declaration issued Sunday.
22211	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	More stringent measures need to be taken to prevent a repeat of the economic turmoil, critics say.
22212	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As APEC leaders largely refrained from digging into details of the pledged action before a new U.S. president takes office next January, world economies should remain strongly vigilant about the ongoing financial storm, which may get worse before it can get any better, analysts say.

22215	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	Israel will benefit by having a democratic Palestinian state that works for peace, U.S. President George W. Bush said Monday.
22216	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	"We strongly believe that Israel will benefit by having a Palestinian state, a democracy on her border that works for peace," Bush said before a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the White House.
22217	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	"Prime Minister, that vision is alive because of you.
22218	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	I thank you for your steadfast support for peace.
22219	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	... I just want you to know that I believe that vision is alive and needs to be worked on," said Bush, referring the two-state solution for the Palestinian- Israeli conflict, proposed by his administration after the 9/11 terrorist attack.
22220	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	Echoing Bush's views, Olmert said: "It continues with your guidance and support and inspiration.
22221	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	And this is very important, because as you say, a two-state solution is the only possible way to resolve the conflict in the Middle East."
22222	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	The Bush-Olmert meeting is expected to focus on "the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel, our continuing mutual efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, and a wide range of regional and international issues," White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto told reporters.
22223	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	Olmert met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney prior to his meeting with Bush, which was described by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz as "the farewell dinner for the outgoing leaders."
22224	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	Bush will leave office on Jan. 20, 2009, while the Israeli prime minister, who resigned in September amid corruption charges, is expected to remain in office until a new government is formed after a February 10 election.

22226	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	(Special for CAFS) More river cholera tests results expected in South Africa
22227	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The results of further tests done to determine if the Limpopo river is contaminated with cholera are expected by Saturday.
22228	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	South African government spokesman Themba Maseko told a media briefing in Pretoria on Friday that the department of water and forestry in Limpopo had increased its surveillance and monitoring of all rivers in the northern Limpopo.
22229	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"All tap water audits thus far have tested negative for any kind of cholera contamination, which means that tap water on the South African side is indeed safe for human consumption."
22230	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	he said.
22231	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the provincial health department confirmed that cholera bacteria had been found in the Limpopo river.
22232	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said the national regulation unit was also monitoring areas close to the Zimbabwean border -- the origin of contamination -- to determine the health of the communities of Musina and Madibo.
22233	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Samples taken, which include raw sewage, would indicate whether cholera is present in waste water.
22234	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"Further tests will help determine whether potable water quality has deteriorated since the last round of sampling," Maseko said.
22235	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Limpopo Health spokesman Phuti Seloba said the department is still awaiting the results of tests done to see if the Nwanedzi river was contaminated by cholera.
22236	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said it was not clear when the results for the river, which serves communities in Madombo and Masisi, would be released.
22237	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Maskeo said the government would send a delegation to Zimbabwe on Monday to assess the deteriorating food and humanitarian crisis.
22238	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	The South African government and United Nations figures show that more than 560 deaths and 12,500 cases of cholera have been recorded in Zimbabwe since August.
22239	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Interview: China's massive afforestation drive aiding global fight against climate change, says World Growth chief
22240	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	by Wei Jianhua
22241	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	POZNAN, Poland, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's far-reaching tree planting efforts in recent years have benefited its environment and economy significantly and should be recognized as one of the key tools to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the chairman of the non-governmental organization World Growth said Wednesday.
22242	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China's afforestation efforts have demonstrated that forestry expansion will effectively reduce global emissions and promote economic growth," Alan Oxley, also former chairman of the GATT Council, said in a written interview with Xinhua.
22243	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China should be commended, and an expanded sustainable forestry will both offset carbon emissions and produce development dividends," said Oxley, adding that China's efforts have largely been ignored at the climate talks in Poznan.
22244	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	According to a new report by World Growth, China pledged in 2006 to expand the country's forest area to 20 percent of total land by 2010, which would increase the size of China's total carbon sink by 50 million tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly enough to offset the emissions of the entire country of Sweden for a whole year.
22245	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China's approach to climate change is fully consistent with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which encourages attention to climate change adaptation.
22246	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China is seeking to improve energy efficiency to reduce emission rates and it is also expanding its forest sinks, which are tangible measures to reduce emission rates, Oxley said.
22247	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, given the need for China to continue to raise living standards and develop the economy, an overall increase in emissions for some time is yet inevitable," he added.
22248	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"This is understandable, China has also indicated that a key aim is to adapt to the impacts of climate change."
22249	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	.
22250	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	The UN technical advisor on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated that expansion of sustainable forestry is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce emissions.
22251	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Yet it is still being ignored by negotiators in industrialized economies.
22252	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Referring to the ongoing Poznan climate talks, Oxley said a long- term strategy to reduce emissions should first give developing countries time to raise living standards.

22254	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	BUDAPEST, Dec. 16 (Xinhua)
22255	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	Hungarian railway workers Tuesday continued their third day of strike, disrupting train services throughout the country, the Hungarian News Agency MTI reported.
22256	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	Many trains, including all the international ones, have been cancelled due to the strike, while others are running on shorter routes or with delays, according to the Hungarian State Railways (MAV).
22257	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The southern railway station in Budapest has been brought to a standstill, but the western and eastern railway stations are still operating.
22258	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The MAV and the railway workers' trade union VDSZSZ held talks Tuesday morning, but reached no agreement.
22259	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	VDSZSZ Chairman Istvan Gasko said the rail workers are determined to continue their strike until an agreement is reached.
22260	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The strike, which involves about 30 percent to 40 percent of Hungarian rail workers, costs the MAV a loss of 700 million forints (about 3.55 million U.S. dollars) each day, according to Gasko.
22261	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	Hungary's railway workers' trade union resumed an open-ended strike from midnight Saturday.
22262	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The strike was first launched in February but has been suspended several times.
22263	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The union is demanding a payment of 250,000 forints (1,340 U.S. dollars) for every worker from privatization revenues of a unit of the MAV and a 10 percent pay rise, to be paid retroactively, for all those who are working for the MAV's subsidiary companies.
22264	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	The MAV said it would not meet the union's "groundless" demands, adding that the strike was aimed at disturbing the implementation of the new railway timetables.
22265	XIN_ENG_20081216.0226.LDC2009T13	Finance Minister Janos Veres also rebuffed the trade union's demands as unfounded Tuesday, saying that the government is not in a position to fulfill such unfounded demands.

22271	XIN_ENG_20081216.0240.LDC2009T13	Three units of Luxembourg-based Arcelor Mittal were fined 301.7 million euros (414 million dollars) in total, followed by German group Kloeckner's 169.3 million euros (232.4 million dollars) and Descours &amp
22272	XIN_ENG_20081216.0240.LDC2009T13	Cabaud's 82.6 million euros (113.4 million dollars).
22273	XIN_ENG_20081216.0240.LDC2009T13	The fine was the highest by the French competition council since it was founded in 1986.
