Borrowing Strategy Using Yen Unravels

TOKYO

Investors loved it. Central bankers worried about it. And though
analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a
prime source of the cheap money that washed through global
markets in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking
whether the  yen carry trade  is seeing its last days.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, the yen carry trade -- the practice of
borrowing Japanese yen at almost zero interest and using that
cash to finance higher-return investments mostly outside Japan --
became a favorite speculative tool of global hedge funds and
small Japanese investors alike.
</P>
<P>
As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers
fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially
lowering the price of risk.
</P>
<P>
The markets have now had a real-world look at what happens when
that edifice of debt unravels. Turmoil in global markets in
recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling
riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry
traders to sell non-Japanese assets  and convert the proceeds
back into yen to pay off their loans.
</P>
<P>
"Carry trades are coming unglued," said Mark Cutis, chief
investment officer at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo. "These are trades
that everybody in our business knew were going to come unstuck."
</P>
<P>
The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much
over."
</P>
<P>
Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies
depressed the value of the yen. Now, the  repurchasing of yen has
driven Japan's currency up against the dollar -- at one point
last week it was up 10 percent over its yearly low.
</P>
<P>
That kind of rise could have deep repercussions for Japan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years
has been driven by export sales that are  in part  linked to the
yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies. A
stronger yen means that Japanese exports become more expensive
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said they believed  the carry trade  was a valuable
financial tool that  would return once markets stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"When volatility gets high, the carry trade does not work," said
Tohru Sasaki   , chief foreign exchange strategist at  JPMorgan
Chase Bank in Tokyo, who  added that the  size of the trade  was
even bigger than  the available data indicated. But the
volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it
does, "the carry trade will resume."
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the debate over the future of the carry trade is partly
a quarrel over whether traditionally cautious Japanese investors
have developed an enduring appetite for risk.
</P>
<P>
To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with
substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their
investments. That view explains, in part, why there was a rush to
convert investments back into yen last week: The currency is seen
as a safe haven in times of volatile markets, and Japanese
investors were with the pack that was fleeing the carry trade.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys conducted by the Japanese government and the Bank
of Japan also show that consumers here generally continue to be
wary about their economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
But others contend that all the talk about the carry trade
obscures a shift in attitudes among  Japanese investors, who are
increasingly eager to seek out foreign investments -- even risky
ones -- to diversify their holdings and increase returns.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index was down 9 percent last week, including a  5.4
percent plunge  Friday that was the worst single-day drop since
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Although Japanese stocks
recovered this week (with the Nikkei recording its best two-day
surge since 2004 on Monday and Tuesday), continuing market
turmoil saw the yen continue to gain against all other
currencies, a sign that no one was rushing back into the carry
trade just yet.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 15 years, a new financial architecture has been
constructed, and the results of this experience have been
overwhelmingly positive for the global economy,"  said Jesper
Koll, president of Tantallon Research Japan, part of an Asian
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're having some market jitters, so we're getting
normalization.
</P>
<P>
"We just don't know where normal i+s yet. That's what the market
is trying to find out."
