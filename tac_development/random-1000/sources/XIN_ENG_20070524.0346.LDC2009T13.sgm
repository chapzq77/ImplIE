Some Los Angeles beaches seriously polluted

LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Seven best-known beaches in the Los Angeles County rank among
California's 10 most polluted, according to an annual
environmental report.
</P>
<P>
For the second straight year, Los Angeles County had the worst
coastal water quality in the state for the 12 months ending March
31, said the report by the environmental group Heal the Bay.
</P>
<P>
Although record low rainfall made most of California's coastal
waters safer to bathe in over the past year by reducing
contaminated storm and creek runoff into the ocean, it wasn't
enough to improve potentially risky bacteria levels at some of
Los Angeles County's best known beaches, according to the report
published by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit group assesses daily and weekly fecal bacteria
pollution from nearly 500 California beach sites from Humboldt
County to the Mexican border, giving each a grade of A through F.
</P>
<P>
Beaches rated F included Surfrider and Marie Canyon storm drain
in Malibu, Santa Monica Municipal Pier area, Castle Rock in the
Pacific Palisades area, and Avalon on Catalina Island.
</P>
<P>
Higher bacteria counts raise the risk of contracting
gastrointestinal ailments, ear infections, upper respiratory
infections and skin rashes, and can also harm fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise in this year's report: the dramatic
deterioration in water quality along the several-mile Long Beach
coastline, which ranked worst in the state, said Mark Gold,
president of Heal the Bay. Nearly all of the 25 beaches tested
there received grades of C through F -- 14 of them Ds and Fs --
leading the environmental group to lump the city's beaches into a
single entity.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dramatic change, as Long Beach historically has had
excellent water quality," Gold said.
