KATHMANDU, Dec. 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Physically disabled persons in Nepal have expressed
dissatisfaction over current political deadlock in the country
while marking the International Day of Disabled 2007 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Various programs were organized throughout Nepal to celebrate the
16th International Disabled Day 2007 with the theme of Decent
Work for People With Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
However, the disabled persons in Nepal are yet to be convinced if
they are going to get decent work opportunity at the time when
the country is going through a total mess due to disagreement
among political parties.
</P>
<P>
"We expected representation from our community in the upcoming
Constituent Assembly (CA) elections, but it seems like the
political leaders have made up their mind to stick on with the
interim parliament and keep on postponing the elections," said
Chhaya Shrestha, one of the participants of the rally organized
to mark the day told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting over current coalition government's apathy towards
disabled persons, Chhaya criticized the government for failing to
offer them any opportunity after democracy was restored in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped to see physically disabled persons representing us in
CA elections but the current political deadlock has put us into
doubt if the election is ever going to take place or not," Chhaya
added.
</P>
<P>
"The politicians only limit proportional representation and
inclusive democracy in their speech," she added.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there are thousands of people, who became physically
disabled after losing their limbs and body parts during a decade
long insurgency, still languishing for government's attention.
</P>
<P>
According to Association for Injured and Disabled Combatant of
the People's War, a sister organization of the Communist Party of
Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M) expressed disappointment over government's
indifference towards the country's disabled people.
</P>
<P>
According to the association's data, some 2,000 CPN-M combatants
who were disabled during the decade long people's conflict are
not getting enough attention from the government.
</P>
<P>
Central member of the association Chitra Bahadur Gharti, who lost
his right hand during the conflict, told Xinhua that some of the
party cadres who lost their limbs and body parts during the
conflict are currently languishing in seven different United
Nations cantonments while those who can still provide assistance
are still deployed in the field to carry out various party works.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the welfare of disabled persons is possible only
through the restructuring of the state," said Gharti, adding that
the main objective of the party would be to provide health,
education and employment to the disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
He added that the CPN-M is providing skill oriented training to
the disabled cadres at the cantonments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking at a program organized to mark the day,
Speaker Subash Nembang stressed the need for Nepal to be a party
to the United Nations (UN) Convention on Disability by ratifying
it.
</P>
<P>
Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal (OHCHR-
Nepal) Chief Richard Bennet also called on Nepali government to
promptly ratify the convention.
</P>
<P>
He said so far 118 nations have ratified the convention and
requested 13 countries including Nepal to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Bennett noted, the majority of people with disabilities live in
conditions of poverty, adding that "Access to decent work is the
key to breaking that poverty trap, while the self sufficiency
that work with fair pay and conditions brings enhances the
dignity of the worker and contributes to the entire society and
economy."
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the International Labor
Organization (ILO), of an estimated 650 million disabled people
in the world, approximately 470 million are of working age.
"There is a strong link between disability and poverty," the ILO
report says.
