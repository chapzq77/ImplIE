InBev says Anheuser Busch takeover is finalized
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, Belgium 2008-11-18 18:20:36 UTC
</P>
<P>
InBev SA formed the world's largest brewer Tuesday when it
completed its $52 billion (euro41 billion) takeover of Anheuser-
Busch Cos. Inc.
</P>
<P>
The new company, named Anheuser-Busch InBev, will be headed by
InBev CEO Carlos Brito and will be headquartered at Leuven,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
InBev promises to keep Anheuser-Busch's St. Louis base as the
company's North American headquarters but the takeover ends 150
years of family rule at Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch President
and CEO August A. Busch IV joins the new company's board as a
non-executive director.
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch shares stopped trading Monday and will now be
swapped for $70 each in cash.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian-Brazilian takeover of Anheuser-Busch comes after a
bitter battle turned sweeter with a higher offer in July, despite
protests in St. Louis that saw politicians criticize the deal and
Web sites call for Bud to be saved from "the waffle guys."
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch provides half of America's beer but it has not
managed to expand around the world as fast as InBev -- a Belgian-
Brazilian hybrid that owns hundreds of local brands but few real
stars.
</P>
<P>
InBev has promised to keep all 12 North American breweries open
as long as the company faces no new U.S. taxes. Anheuser-Busch
already plans to shed 1,185 jobs -- mostly by offering early
retirement and not filling vacancies.
</P>
<P>
The company did not mention a dispute with Mexico's largest
brewer Grupo Modelo -- which was 50-percent owned by Anheuser-
Busch. Grupo Modelo filed a notice of arbitration against
Anheuser-Busch last month, saying the takeover violated their
investment agreement and its right of consent to enter into a
partnership with InBev.
</P>
<P>
Taking over Anheuser-Busch gives InBev a jewel of a brand in
Budweiser -- the world's top selling beer -- which it promises to
sell more widely by pushing into emerging economies in Asia,
Latin America and eastern Europe. It will sell a fifth of all
beer in both Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
This will help generate growth as beer sales decline in North
America and Europe where drinkers are cutting back and turning to
wine and other drinks.
</P>
<P>
The new company leapfrogs SABMiller as top brewer and becomes one
of the world's top five consumer goods companies.
</P>
<P>
Brito said the combination had created "a stronger, more
competitive global company with a leading international brand
portfolio and distribution network, and great potential for
growth all over the world."
</P>
<P>
InBev said it now had all the regulatory clearances it needed for
the deal.
</P>
<P>
China approved the takeover on Tuesday but barred the company
from increasing existing stakes in Chinese brewers. It said it
was necessary to prevent Anheuser-Busch InBev becoming a monopoly
in the country.
</P>
<P>
This curbs future growth in the world's most populous nation. It
caps Anheuser-Busch's 27-percent stake in Tsingtao Beer Ltd. and
InBev's 28.5 percent holding in Zhujiang Beer Ltd. They will also
be prohibited from linking up with two leading Chinese breweries,
Huarun Snow Beer Ltd. and Beijing Yanjing Beer Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice cleared the deal last week after
InBev agreed to sell Labatt USA, which sells the Canadian beer in
the U.S. It will hold on to Labatt in Canada. InBev did not say
who would buy the American unit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. antitrust officials had worried that beer prices would
increase in upstate New York because -- with Budweiser and Labatt
Blue -- the two companies would supply most of the beer in the
region.
</P>
<P>
InBev has borrowed $45 billion to pay for the deal and secured
$9.8 billion in equity bridge financing that it had planned to
replace with a share issue in October.
</P>
<P>
But rocky financial markets forced it to postpone issuing new
shares and it says it can keep the bridge financing in place for
up to six months after it closes the deal and issue shares early
next year.
</P>
<P>
InBev says the company is well positioned to cope with a slowing
global economy because costs for key ingredients such as grain
malt for brewing beer and aluminum for beer cans will fall even
as sales stall.
</P>
<P>
InBev is renowned for shaving costs since it was formed in a 2004
merger between Belgium's Interbrew and Brazil-based AmBev.
</P>
<P>
Beer industry analysts Plato Logic says beer sales will slow
significantly to expand just 3 percent next year as economies
around the world shrink or stagnate.
