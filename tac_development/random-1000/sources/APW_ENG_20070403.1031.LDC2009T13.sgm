The organizers of the 2010 World Cup downplayed concerns about
safety Tuesday, one day after the head of South Africa's soccer
association was injured at home by an intruder.
</P>
<P>
South African Football Association CEO Raymond Hack injured his
eye in Monday's skirmish with the intruder, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want to express our sympathy to Raymond Hack for what
happened," said Irvin Khoza, chairman of the local organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
Danny Jordaan, the CEO of the organizing committee, said crime in
South Africa was a concern, but sports events in the country had
been relatively incident-free.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of societal crime is a matter the country must address
but South Africa is not unique and when it comes to crime at
sports events, South Africa has a track record equal to any other
country," Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to ease fears about South Africa's rampant rate of violent
crime and theft, the government has promised to boost the number
of police officers on the streets by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Khoza also said construction on the five new stadiums was
underway while work on the five existing venues was on track to
start in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
This comes as a fresh bid to stop the construction of the Green
Point Stadium in Cape Town was launched in court.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Town Environmental Protection Association filed papers
in the High Court requesting an urgent injunction to halt the 2.9
billion rand (US$392.4 million; euro294 million) stadium, SAPA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Work on the stadium, which will host one of the World Cup
semifinals, finally got underway on March 20. Approval for the
building of the stadium was held up by local residents who
questioned the positioning of the stadium, and then by mayor
Helen Zille's cautious approach to funding as she sought
financial guarantees to cover potential building cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee spokeswoman Thumi Makgabo confirmed that
papers had been lodged and that the city was studying the
documentation and was expected to oppose the action.
</P>
<P>
"But construction and related work continues and has not been
affected," Makgabo said.
