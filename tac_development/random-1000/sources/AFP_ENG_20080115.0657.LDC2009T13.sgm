Orphaned Bangladeshi conjoined twins set for separation: carers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orphaned Bangladeshi conjoined twins have survived an initial
operation, but it will be another six months before they can be
separated, the Australian charity looking after them said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One-year-old girls Trishna and Krishna are joined at the head but
have separate brains. If the twins are not separated, they are
expected to die.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons, who carried out the first surgical procedure last week,
have assessed that they can be separated but it will be a
difficult task.
</P>
<P>
"They have had one stage of an operation. They have got to have
six months of preparation before they can be separated," Margaret
Smith, chief executive of the Children First Foundation, told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"They are very beautiful little girls. They are quite normal.
They just happen to be joined at the head."
</P>
<P>
The children were brought to Australia late last year from
Bangladesh, where they were living in an orphanage at an
undisclosed location. According to the charity, they were
orphaned at birth in December 2006.
</P>
<P>
They are staying at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital, one of
Australia's leading medical institutions for children, and will
live at a rehabilitation centre in the countryside if
successfully separated, while recovering from the surgery.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the veins which drain from the two girls'
brains are joined, causing blood to flow from one child to the
other. As a result, the smaller of the two is suffering heart
failure already.
</P>
<P>
Wirginia Maixner, director of neurosurgery at the hospital, has
told Melbourne's The Age newspaper the task ahead was "momentous"
but separation was the only option.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these children with this problem die before they get to
a major centre, so they've done well to survive to one year of
age. But if one child dies they both die," Maixner told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The girls require another three or four operations over the next
six months, with the next scheduled for six weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
The charity has raised 250,000 Australian dollars (225,000 US) to
cover the basic medical costs, but is still seeking 150,000
dollars to cover ongoing care costs, of which Smith said 10,000
dollars has so far been raised.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the government would see if
there was any way it could help, but warned it was unlikely as
large numbers of Australians with surgical needs were unable to
pay for them.
