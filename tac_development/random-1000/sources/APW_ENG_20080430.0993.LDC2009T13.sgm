Bavarian police seize collection of Latin American artifacts
believed worth US$100 million

MUNICH, Germany 2008-04-30 15:57:27 UTC
</P>
<P>
Munich police said Wednesday they have seized a large collection
of Aztec, Incan and Mayan cultural artifacts that Costa Rican
authorities say were illegally taken from their country.
</P>
<P>
Art theft specialists from Bavaria's criminal investigations
office estimate that the collection, which includes around 1,100
masks, necklaces and statues, is worth about US$100 million
(euro64 million), said Ludwig Waldinger, a spokesman for the
office.
</P>
<P>
Waldinger said that Costa Rican authorities appealed to Germany
and Interpol last week to help find a collection that they
contend was removed from the country illegally by a 66-year-old
art collector named Leonardo Augustus Patterson.
</P>
<P>
Patterson, a former diplomat from Costa Rica, claims to have
proper ownership of the artifacts, investigators said. The
collection includes pieces made by Native American craftsmen in
El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Peru and Colombia in addition to
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Waldinger said that Patterson recently arranged for the
collection to be shipped from Costa Rica to Europe. After
clearing customs in Spain, the artifacts were loaded onto a
caravan of semitrailers and driven to Munich.
</P>
<P>
Bavarian authorities found the collection packed in more than 100
wooden crates at an undisclosed location in Munich in southern
Germany. They also found Patterson, who has been questioned by
investigators but is not in police custody, said Waldinger.
</P>
<P>
He could face criminal charges if it is determined that he is not
the collection's rightful owner, Waldinger said.
</P>
<P>
Waldinger added that authorities want to unpack and catalog the
art, but need to coordinate that effort with archaeologists and
Latin American officials -- a process that could take up to a
month.
