NAIROBI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Rift Valley Fever disease has claimed two more lives at the
Sangailu dispensary and Garissa Provincial General Hospital in
Kenya's North Eastern Province, raising the death toll to 52,
Kenya News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four new cases of the fever have been recorded in Ijara and
Garissa Districts in the province to bring the total number of
cumulative cases in the region to 105.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press on Monday, North Eastern Provincial Medical
Officer of Health Ahmed Omar said that one death has occurred at
Sangailu dispensary while patients from Bilbil in Tana River
District in Coast Province succumbed to the disease at the
Garissa Provincial General Hospital last night.
</P>
<P>
He said teams of 10 doctors were dispatched Monday morning to
support other doctors on the ground to prevent the killer disease
from spreading further. Three of the four new cases are recorded
in Ijara while the other is from Garissa District.
</P>
<P>
Omar said that due to the vastness of the province, it was
difficult to tell whether the disease was under control adding
that he was waiting for reports from doctors on the ground
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He decried the impassability of roads in the region and the
nomadic lifestyle of the local community adding that the twin
problems have hampered government effort to control disease once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
Rift Valley Fever is endemic in Africa, naturally occurring in
livestock but occasionally affecting humans. Animals are infected
with the virus by the Aedes mosquito.
</P>
<P>
The disease, characterized by bleeding from all orifices, is
spread to humans in a number of ways: from infected mosquitoes;
through contact with blood or other body fluids; or from the
organs of infected animals.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the disease include fever, general weakness and
malaise, cough and diarrhoea, with severe cases progressing to
show facial swelling and bleeding from the orifices. The
incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms)
of Rift Valley Fever varies from two to six days.
</P>
<P>
The fever mainly occurs following periods of heavy rainfall. In
1998, an outbreak claimed at least 200 lives in the North Eastern
Province following the El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's North Eastern and Coast provinces also experienced heavy
rainfall in November and December this year which led to massive
flooding, affecting hundreds of thousands of people.
