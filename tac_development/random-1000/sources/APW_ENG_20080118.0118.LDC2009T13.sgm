The name "Teeth" may ring a bell with you. It's a film that had
audiences laughing and squirming simultaneously last year at
Sundance, where it earned an acting prize for its fresh-faced,
fearless star, Jess Weixler.
</P>
<P>
But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so
we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage
girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth. Yes, she is a
living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor
Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his
feature debut.
</P>
<P>
Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi
B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the
girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her
deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge
tale. It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward
the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross-
out factor he'd established early on. (You do see severed, um,
parts.)
</P>
<P>
For a while, though, it's easy to get engrossed in the surreal
suburban life of Weixler's squeaky-clean Dawn, a pretty, poised
high school student who goes around speaking to groups about the
importance of abstinence. She's part of an organization known as
The Promise, and gives out red plastic rings for kids to wear as
a reminder of their chastity. Even kissing is a no-no. But
Lichtenstein never makes fun of her, and Weixler, whose wholesome
blond looks are reminiscent of a younger Heather Graham, treats
the character with just as much respect.
</P>
<P>
Dawn may be fiercely protective of her innocence in reaction to
an event that took place when she was a very young girl,
something she doesn't even remember but we see at the film's
start. Her new stepbrother, Brad, tries to mess around with her
while the two are in a kiddie wading pool and gets "bitten";
years later, grown-up Brad (John Hensley from "Nip/Tuck"), is
tatted, pierced, perpetually stoned and hates women. But he still
wants to do it with Dawn, and the fact that she's so fearful of
her budding sexuality only makes her more desirable.
</P>
<P>
Being a teenager, though, her curiosity eventually takes over and
she allows herself to become interested in a boy in the
abstinence group, the slightly goofy Tobey (Hale Appleman). But
when he tries to go too far with her while swimming at the lake
one afternoon, he learns too late that no really does mean no. A
visit to the gynecologist to find out what's wrong with her also
has disastrous consequences. (It's the film's funniest scene,
mainly because we all know what's coming and the arrogant doctor
doesn't).
</P>
<P>
Eventually, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew (sorry,
couldn't resist) as Dawn feels increasingly comfortable in her
own skin and begins seducing men who deserve their comeuppance.
(Its climactic moment, if you will, is way too over the top.) And
a subplot involving her dying mother seems out of place in
contrast with the comedy.
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to imagine "Teeth" gaining a cult following through
midnight showings; it's the kind of movie you want to watch with
friends, to laugh and scream and not have to think too hard, and
then who knows? Maybe go home and get lucky afterward.
</P>
<P>
"Teeth," a Roadside Attractions release, runs 87 minutes. Two and
a half stars out of four.
