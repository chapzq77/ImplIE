<P>
Georgia's former defense minister was freed on a multimillion-
dollar bail early Tuesday after retracting his accusations
against the president and left the country, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Irakly Okruashvili was arrested Sept. 27, the day after he
accused President Mikhail Saakashvili of a murder plot and
corruption -- allegations Saakashvili dismissed as "unpardonable
lies."
</P>
<P>
Okruashvili was charged with extortion, money-laundering and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nika Gvaramia, Georgia's deputy chief prosecutor, said
Okruashvili had retracted his accusations and admitted he made
them for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Gvaramia also said that Okruashvili had pleaded guilty to charges
of extortion and failure to properly perform his duties.
</P>
<P>
Georgian television stations on Monday broadcast footage of the
questioning in which Okruashvili retracted his accusations.
Okruashvili, wearing a track suit, looked tense and tired but
spoke clearly.
</P>
<P>
A court in the capital, Tbilisi, ruled Monday to free Okruashvili
on bail equivalent to US$6 million (euro4.3 million). Okruashvili
was freed overnight after he produced the money and was escorted
home by police.
</P>
<P>
He refused to answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, the Georgian Pirveli news agency quoted
Okruashvili's bodyguards as saying he had left the country with
his family.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Keti Chomakhishvili who was in charge of Okruashvili's
case couldn't confirm that he went abroad, but said it could be
part of an arrangement with authorities.
</P>
<P>
Okruashvili was a longtime Saakashvili ally who served as his
defense minister until late last year. His accusations and arrest
have thrown the ex-Soviet nation into its worst political turmoil
since Saakashvili was propelled to power in the 2003 uprising
known as the Rose Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said Monday that Okruashvili had been forced
into making his statement and promised to go ahead with protests
demanding Saakashvili's ouster.
