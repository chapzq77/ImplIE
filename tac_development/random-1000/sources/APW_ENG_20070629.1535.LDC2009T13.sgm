Voting began in East Timor's parliamentary elections Saturday, in
a key vote in which Independence hero Xanana Gusmao will make a
bid to strip power from the party that has ruled East Timor since
it broke from Indonesian rule.

"I woke up very early to take part in deciding my country's
destiny," said Justino da Costa, a 53-year-old cab driver who got
in line before dawn to cast a vote in the capital, Dili.

Fourteen parties are running, but the fiercest battle is between
Gusmao's fledgling CNRT and the left-leaning Fretilin party of
longtime rival Mari Alkatiri, the former prime minister.

<P>
Analysts do not expect an outright majority for any party,
meaning a coalition government will have to be negotiated in the
former Portuguese colony, which voted to separate from Indonesia
in 1999 after 24 years of brutal occupation.

The nation of less than a million people descended into chaos
last year when fighting between police and army forces killed 37
people and drove 155,000 from their homes. About 10 percent of
the population remains in dirty camps.

<P>
More than 548,000 people have registered to vote in the third
election since April, overseen by around 500 foreign monitors and
3,000 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
In May, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta won the largely
ceremonial role of president, taking 70 percent of votes in a run
off.
