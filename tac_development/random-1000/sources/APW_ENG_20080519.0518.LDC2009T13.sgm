Pakistan government ' s instability could delay progress in peace
talks with India

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-05-19 12:20:50 UTC
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan will hold peace talks Tuesday for the first
time since Islamabad shifted from military rule, but the
instability of the new civilian government could prove a hurdle
to even modest progress, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Bombings last week in the historic Indian city of Jaipur that
killed 61 people will also shadow the meeting. India has accused
Pakistan-based Islamic militants of involvement in past attacks.
Recent incidents in disputed Kashmir, including one Monday in
which the Indian army said it lost a soldier due to firing from
the Pakistani side, could also have an impact.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the latest twists, South Asia's nuclear-armed
neighbors want to keep talking.
</P>
<P>
Neither wants to revert to the hostility that has dogged
relations for 60 years and led to three wars since the partition
of the subcontinent on independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new coalition government -- formed by parties that
triumphed in February elections that dealt a heavy defeat to
allies of President Pervez Musharraf -- says it wants to press on
with the peace talks that Musharraf kickstarted in early 2004.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough in the slow-moving dialogue appears unlikely --
not least because of a falling out within the coalition over how
to restore judges fired last year by the former military
strongman. That dispute has raised doubts over the government's
survival.
</P>
<P>
"The new government is so fragile," said Moonis Ahmar, a
Pakistani international affairs analyst. "As long as the
fragility is there, then it cannot make a decision."
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Pakistan and India are aimed at
ultimately resolving their conflict over the divided Himalayan
territory of Kashmir. So far the talks have diminished the
possibility of war, and fostered cultural and transportation
links, but achieved little else.
</P>
<P>
This week's session in Islamabad will review progress after the
four rounds of wide-ranging talks held so far, said Mohammed
Sadiq, spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. First top civil
servants will hold talks, then the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan state news agency reported Indian External Affairs
Minister Pranab Mukherjee was also likely meet a host of other
top Pakistani figures -- underscoring confusion over who is now
calling the shots in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested he would meet Prime Minister Yousuf Raza
Gilani, Asif Ali Zardari, the chief of the main coalition party
and seen as the power behind the prime minister, ex-premier Nawaz
Sharif, chief of the junior coalition party, and Musharraf --
although after years of dominance, the president now appears a
marginal figure.
</P>
<P>
Now "there is no focal point and the prime minister is just
bogus," said Pakistani political analyst Talat Masood. "He
doesn't have the power and everyone is looking over the shoulder
to Mr. Zardari or others to Nawaz Sharif."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the talks could lead to easing of travel and visa
restrictions but no headway is expected on core issues including
the military confrontation in the high-altitude Siachen glacier
area, and, of course, Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Ashok Mehta, a strategic analyst in New Delhi, predicted little
progress partly because India was uncertain if the new Pakistani
government would continue Musharraf's policies.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators had reached a framework solution for Kashmir, but
"India failed to capitalize due to lack of political will," Mehta
said, adding that it's unclear if the same deal was still an
option because officials in the new Pakistani government "don't
want Musharraf's proposals on anything."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over
Muslim-majority Kashmir, and Pakistan-based militant groups have
been fighting there since 1989, seeking independence from
predominantly Hindu India or a merger with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an Indian soldier died when an army post along the
cease-fire line dividing Kashmir came under fire from Pakistani
territory, the Indian army said. It was the second alleged
incident of firing across the frontier in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military spokesman could not immediately be reached
Monday but he has denied the previous incident.
</P>
<P>
Masood said the fact that talks are continuing is a good sign. He
said it did not appear the Jaipur blasts would undermine them.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown Islamic militant group calling itself the
Indian Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility. Indian media
reports say police are also investigating a Bangladesh-based
extremist group.
</P>
<P>
Even if concrete evidence emerged that Pakistani groups were
involved, Masood said it was unlikely it would stop the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they necessarily want to build up tension," he
said. "India is interested in economic growth. It is wiser to
cooperate with Pakistan rather than making a fuss out of it."
