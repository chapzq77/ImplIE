Defending America's Cup champion Alinghi won the Louis Vuitton
Act season championship Saturday after winning the final fleet
race of Act 13.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi overtook BMW Oracle Racing on the second lap, securing
the Swiss team's second championship with a fourth victory in
seven races of Act 13.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi finished with 78 points, 14 more than two-time season
winner Emirates Team New Zealand. Mascalzone Latino was the best
of the three Italian syndicates, finishing third with 63 points
after a third-place finish in the final fleet race.
</P>
<P>
American entry BMW Oracle Racing finished fifth with 57 points --
two less than Luna Rossa of Italy -- after skipper Chris Dickson
recovered from a disappointing sixth in the sixth race to lead
the USA 87 yacht to second in the final race, its best finish
since winning the opener of Act 13.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's two fleet races were the last chance for the 11
challengers to race against Alinghi. From April 16-June 11, the
challengers begin sailing against each other in a round-robin
competition that will determine who advances to race Alinghi in
the America's Cup, from June 23 to July 4.
</P>
<P>
Act 13 is worth triple points with teams receiving bonus points
because Alinghi is not factored into the standings. Points are
carried into the round-robin stage of the Louis Vuitton Cup which
could mean the difference in a tiebreaker for the final places of
the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth race, Spanish team Desafio Espanol won its first
ever fleet race after overtaking Alinghi halfway through the
first lap before winning a last lap drag race by a boat length.
</P>
<P>
Italy's +39 Challenger was unable to race for the third straight
day due to a broken mast.
</P>
<P>
American helmsman Ed Baird steered Alinghi into the lead after
tacking the SUI 91 boat to a middle course from the start, with
the Spaniards following and the rest of the fleet divided between
left and right courses.
</P>
<P>
Desafio Espanol helmsman Karol Jablonski crossed ahead of Baird
and extended the Spanish lead to 21 seconds after rounding the
windmarker, widening the gap to 138 meters (yards) after a gybe
left the Swiss boat on starboard.
</P>
<P>
Dickson took BMW Oracle Racing to the left-hand course before
rounding the far marker and tacking left again on the third lap,
a decision that slowed the Americans as they dropped further
behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Alinghi cut into Desafio Espanol's lead around the final marker
as the Spaniards had trouble getting the spinnaker out, but the
hosts held the course for the victory, a result that helped push
them up to sixth in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Challenger Commission -- a panel comprising the 11
challengers -- ruled it would not support an amendment to the
America's Cup rules that would have allowed +39 Challenger to use
one of United Internet Team Germany's masts. A jury ruled the
Germans were at fault for their collision in Wednesday's third
fleet race.
