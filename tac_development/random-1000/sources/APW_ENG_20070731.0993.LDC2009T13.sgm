The French government forecast a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of
gross domestic product next year, down from a projected 2.4
percent for 2007, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fillon also announced plans to stimulate the economy that include
a drastic trimming of the civil servants corps.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to inject euro10 billion (US$13.7 billion)
to boost the French economy next year, along with public sector
modernization and improvement in labor market mobility, Fillon
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
France will begin trimming the ranks of civil servants. It will
not replace the 22,700 civil servants who will be retiring --
nearly double the 12,000 who were not replaced this year, Fillon
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was in line with the government's aim of
replacing only one public employee for every two who retire in a
bid to trim spending.
</P>
<P>
Fillon told reporters that the 2008 budget is based on an
inflation-adjusted growth rate forecast to be 2.5 percent and an
inflation rate of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest drop in unemployment, which fell to 8
percent in June, Fillon noted the rate was the lowest in 25 years
but stressed that the government wants to reduce it further, to 5
percent by 2012.
</P>
<P>
The government's effort is up against the weight of France's debt
service burden, which the prime minister said is rising due to
higher interest rates.
