<HEADLINE>
International gymnastics chief wants to establish independent
judges pool

<P>
Gymnastics judges would no longer answer to officials in their
own countries under the latest effort to remove politics from the
sport.
</P>
<P>
International Gymnastics Federation president Bruno Grandi said
Monday he wants to establish a pool of judges who would have no
ties or allegiances to their national federations. The pool could
be in place by 2010 or 2011.
</P>
<P>
"It is the last war I have against everybody," Grandi, speaking
mostly through an interpreter, said in a 90-minute interview
after the federation's annual meeting in Orlando. "If the people
understand that it's only in the interest of gymnastics, in two
or three years we solve another big problem."
</P>
<P>
The federation -- or FIG -- already uses a judges pool for
rhythmic gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Grandi led the charge to revamp the sport's traditional 10-point
scale to an open-ended scoring system, which is supposed to give
a truer representation of routine's value. The system has been in
use since the beginning of 2006, and will get its biggest test at
the Beijing Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
The change came after a series of judging errors at the Athens
Olympics, most notably the debacle involving all-around champion
Paul Hamm.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the competition, FIG announced that South Korea's
Yang Tae-young wrongly had 0.1 points deducted off the start
value of his second-to-last routine, the parallel bars. Yang
finished third, 0.049 points behind Hamm.
</P>
<P>
Grandi's suggestion that Hamm share his gold medal fueled
protests by the South Koreans that forced the American to defend
himself all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Hamm
eventually was declared the rightful winner, and Grandi said
again Monday he agreed with that decision.
</P>
<P>
"Paul Hamm is the Olympic champion without any ifs or buts,"
Grandi said.
</P>
<P>
But the Hamm incident wasn't the only reason gymnastics had to
change its rules, Grandi said. There also were problems with the
men's high bar and vault competitions in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Grandi also expressed concern that some don't fully understand
the new points system, wrongly believing that more difficult
routines are rewarded even if performed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
"The big problem we're having lately is that we have to penalize
very strongly execution mistakes or lack of artistry," he said.
"This is the big philosophy I want to get through. You should win
if you have high difficulty, but only if it is executed
perfectly. If not, the deductions should be so strong that it's
worse to do the more difficult thing."
</P>
<P>
Execution penalties are already higher than under the old system
-- eight-tenths of a point, compared to a half-point -- but
Grandi said he'd like to see them doubled. The federation has
also held classes to make sure judges understand the new rules,
and is using video replay so judges can review routines.
</P>
<P>
"I intend for the Olympic Games to make sure the judges will
apply the rules correctly," Grandi said.
