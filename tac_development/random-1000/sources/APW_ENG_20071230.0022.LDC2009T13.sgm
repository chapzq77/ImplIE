Bin Laden issues warning on Iraq, Israel in new audiotape to
unify al-Qaida

CAIRO, Egypt 2007-12-30 00:12:08 UTC

Osama bin Laden warned Iraq's Sunni Arabs against fighting al-
Qaida and vowed to expand the terror group's holy war to Israel
in a new audiotape Saturday, threatening "blood for blood,
destruction for destruction."
</P>
<P>
Most of the 56-minute tape dealt with Iraq, apparently al-Qaida's
latest attempt to keep supporters in Iraq unified at a time when
the U.S. military claims to have al-Qaida's Iraq branch on the
run.
</P>
<P>
The tape did not mention Pakistan or the assassination of Benazir
Bhutto, though Pakistan's government has blamed al-Qaida and the
Taliban for her death on Thursday. That suggested the tape was
made before the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's comments offered an unusually direct attack on
Israel, stepping up al-Qaida's attempts to use the Israeli-Arab
conflict to rally supporters. Israel has warned of growing al-
Qaida activity in Palestinian territory, though terror network is
not believed to have taken a strong role there so far.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to liberate Palestine, the whole of Palestine from the
(Jordan) river to the sea," he said, threatening "blood for
blood, destruction for destruction."
</P>
<P>
"We will not recognize even one inch for Jews in the land of
Palestine as other Muslim leaders have," bin Laden said.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, a number of Sunni Arab tribes in western Anbar province
have formed a coalition fighting al-Qaida-linked insurgents that
U.S. officials credit for deeply reducing violence in the
province. The U.S. military has been working to form similar
"Awakening Councils" in other areas of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden said Sunni Arabs who have joined the Awakening Councils
"have betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their
people. They will suffer in life and in the afterlife."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said bin Laden's tape shows
that al-Qaida's aim is to block democracy and freedom for all
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
"It also reminds us that the mission to defeat al-Qaida in Iraq
is critically important and must succeed," Fratto said. "The
Iraqi people -- every day, and in increasing numbers -- are
choosing freedom and standing against the murderous, hateful
ideology of AQI. And we stand with them."
</P>
<P>
Several hours before the tape was issued, the top U.S. commander
in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, said al-Qaida was becoming
increasingly fearful of losing the support of Sunni Arabs and had
begun targeting the leaders of the Awakening Councils.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus said al-Qaida attaches "enormous importance" to "these
tribes that have turned against them, and to the general sense
that Sunni Arab communities have rejected them more and more
around Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by
attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al-
Qaida, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the audiotape, bin Laden denounced Abdul-Sattar Abu Risha, the
former leader of the Anbar Awakening Council, who was killed in a
September bombing claimed by al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
"The most evil of the traitors are those who trade away their
religion for the sake of their mortal life," bin Laden said.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden said U.S. and Iraqi officials are seeking to set up a
"national unity government" joining the country's Sunnis, Shiites
and Kurds.
</P>
<P>
"Our duty is to foil these dangerous schemes, which try to
prevent the establishment of an Islamic state in Iraq, which
would be a wall of resistance against American schemes to divide
Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iraq's Sunni Arabs to rally behind the Islamic State
of Iraq, the insurgent umbrella group led by al-Qaida. Besides
the Awakening Councils, some Sunni insurgent groups that continue
to fight the Americans have rejected the Islamic State.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden said Sunnis should pledge their allegiance to Abu Omar
al-Baghdadi, the little known "emir" or leader of the Islamic
State of Iraq. U.S. officials have claimed that al-Baghdadi does
not exist, saying al-Qaida created the name to give its coalition
the illusion of an Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to give allegiance to the emir after he has been
endorsed leads to great evils," bin Laden warned. "Emir Abu Omar
would rather have his neck severed than betray the Muslims ...
Emir Abu Omar and his brothers are not one of those who accept
compromise or meeting the enemy halfway."
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the tape could not be independently
confirmed. But the voice resembled that of bin Laden. The tape
was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media
arm, Al-Sahab, issues the group's messages.
</P>
<P>
The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a
flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing
any tapes. The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed
bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years. The other
messages this year have been audiotapes.
</P>
<P>
In an October tape, bin Laden sought to patch up splits between
Iraqi insurgent factions, urging them to unite with the Islamic
State of Iraq -- the insurgent coalition led by al-Qaida. He took
a conciliatory stance, chiding even al-Qaida's followers for
being too "extremist" in their positions toward other insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec.
16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti-
Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone
cooperating with the Americans.
