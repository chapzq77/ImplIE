as national convention ends

YANGON, Sept. 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Myanmar announced the complete end of its national convention
here Monday, laying down all detailed basic principles for
drafting a new state constitution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said this is the formal end of the first step of a
seven-step roadmap to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a
special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on
all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the
convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a
general election to produce parliament representatives and
formation of a new democratic government in line with the
government's seven-step roadmap.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the
national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the
Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi
Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The country will adopt an executive system of President as head
of state and empower a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union Parliament)
which comprises Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and
Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) in legislation.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy
system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic
system economically.
</P>
<P>
The basic principles designate that the country's administrative
regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as  seven
regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national
races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self-
administered zones or higher-level division.
</P>
<P>
The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25
percent of the parliament representatives in different-level
parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces'
commander-in-chief. Besides, armed forces members are also to be
nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four
government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and
border affairs. The defense services commander-in-chief will
represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the
right to take over and exercise state power in case of state
emergency that could cause disintegration of the union,
disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled
new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an
independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly
relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful
coexistence among nations. It will not allow foreign troops to be
deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18,
1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and
adopted at once a multi-party political system and market-
oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
The military government sponsored a multi-party general election
across the country on May 27, 1990, in which  Aung-San- Suu-Kyi-
led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary
seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
The  government started convening the constitutional national
convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences
on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and
the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention
in November 1995. As a result, the national convention turned
into a status of long adjournment from March 1996 to April 2004.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at realization of national reconciliation and pushing
forward the process of democratization, the military government
announced the seven-step roadmap in August 2003, which mainly
include the reconvening of national convention, drafting of new
state constitution, holding of national referendum on drafted
constitution, sponsoring general election and formation of new
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the
constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution-
drafting process. However, citing the reason of military
government's house arrest placed on the party's general secretary
Aung San Suu Kyi and its vice-chairman U Tin Oo, the NLD kept
boycotting the convention until its end.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of
the constitutional national convention but did not mention the
duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the
time table about when the national referendum on the drafted
constitution will be held.
</P>
<P>
Observers here commented that Myanmar's constitution-drafting
process is still not finished yet and the public concern will
naturally focus on the country people's decision on the drafted
constitution in the upcoming national referendum.
