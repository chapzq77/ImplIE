FIERCE REMATCH LOOMS, BUT NEITHER MAN THRILLS SPAIN

MADRID, Spain
</P>
<P>
They are two angry political warriors bearing grudges from the
past, convinced the other is a liar and an incompetent destined
to destroy the country.
</P>
<P>
As Spain prepares for a general election on Sunday, Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on the left and Mariano
Rajoy on the right are poised for a rematch of their bitter
contest four years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was then that Zapatero unexpectedly swept to victory, ousting
Rajoy's Popular Party from power as enraged voters protested the
government's mishandling of terrorist bombings that killed 191
people in Madrid three days before the election.
</P>
<P>
The candidates have used this year's campaign not only to lay out
starkly different visions for Spain but also to settle personal
scores.
</P>
<P>
Rajoy still contends that he was a victim of circumstances in
2004, robbed of victory after his party insisted that the
outlawed Basque separatist group ETA was responsible for the
attack, despite evidence that pointed to radical Islamists.
</P>
<P>
For him, the election swept in a government that lacked
legitimacy and since then has abused its mandate by shattering
family values, weakening the economy, embracing unworthy
immigrants and coddling terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Zapatero sees himself as armed with "a secular vision" aimed at
eradicating sexual inequality and religious conservatism,
granting more autonomy to Spain's provinces and integrating
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
For him, Rajoy is a prisoner of the past who has sought revenge
for his electoral loss in 2004 by using the conservative party he
heads to try to undermine the government's ability to rule.
</P>
<P>
Despite the mudslinging, political analysts and pollsters say
neither candidate has managed to excite voters or lay out a
coherent vision. But in poll after poll for months, Zapatero has
consistently stayed in the lead. The wild card in the election is
potential fallout from the chilling gang-style killing of a
former city councilman from the Socialist Party on Friday. Both
the government and the opposition have blamed ETA for the
killing.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Rajoy has attacked Zapatero for
negotiating with ETA. Zapatero cut off the talks after ETA bombed
Madrid's airport in December 2006, then admitted in January of
this year that indirect contacts had continued. Since then, Rajoy
has accused him of lying.
</P>
<P>
ETA, which has killed more than 800 people over four decades in a
bid for an independent Basque homeland, is considered a terrorist
group by the United States and the European Union.
