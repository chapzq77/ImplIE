<P>
The U.S. military and Japan's Self-Defense Force will conduct
large-scale joint war games in early November at various sites
throughout Japan, the Stars and Stripes reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Keen Sword 2008 exercise, set for Nov. 5-16, is a field-
training exercise designed to "fortify the defense of Japan
through scenarios incorporating air, ground and sea operations,"
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said it will involve about 11,000 sailors, 105
soldiers, 650 airmen and 250 Marines from the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
Ten U.S. ships will also participate in various phases of Keen
Sword.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22,500 personnel, 100 ships and 450 aircraft from both
sides are expected to be mobilized for the drill.
</P>
<P>
Keen Sword is part of an annual series between the U.S. and Japan
that dates back to 1986.
</P>
<P>
This year's exercise marks the ninth time Keen Sword has been
held and the first since 2004.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also stage Keen Edge, a bilateral command-post
exercise that uses computer-generated "emergencies" to test
reaction capabilities in reality.
