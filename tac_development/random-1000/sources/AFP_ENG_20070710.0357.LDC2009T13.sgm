Danish drivers offered insurance against speeding tickets

<P>
Danish motorists can now sign an insurance policy against
speeding tickets, the Danish car enthusiasts' club Fartklubben
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For an annual membership fee of 995 kroner (134 euros, 183
dollars), members of the "Speeding Club" can have up to four
fines reimbursed a year, with a maximum reimbursement of 10,000
Danish kroner (1,344 euros, 1,836 dollars).
</P>
<P>
For an additional fee of 395 kroner (53 euros, 72 dollars), the
club also offers to pay up to four parking tickets a year,
totalling no more than 2,000 kroner (269 euros, 367 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The increasing number of speed checks with fines ranging between
500 and 7,000 kroner and more could lead to unexpected costs that
could seriously harm many people's personal finances," the club
wrote on its website.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that 250,000 people had received speeding fines in
2006.
</P>
<P>
Poul Winther, the head of Fartklubben, told the free daily
newspaper Urban that the initiative was not aimed at "urging (the
drivers) to drive faster."
</P>
<P>
"But the police and the politicians are exploiting the fact that
our cars can drive faster today to install radars which are cash
cows," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Danish Road Safety Council said meanwhile the initiative was
foolish.
</P>
<P>
"If you can now take out insurance against dangerous behaviour,
it is a serious attack against the road safety which has already
seen a negative development due to the increased number of
speeding offenses," Council official Jesper Soelund told Urban.
