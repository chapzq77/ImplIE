<P>
Rescuers found the body of the last missing miner from a flooded
coal mine accident in central China's Henan Province on Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In all, two people died. Thirty-two others were rescued early
this morning. They spent almost 23 hours underground in a flooded
mine shaft.
</P>
<P>
All are described as being in stable condition at a local
hospital.

Wang Dexue, deputy head of the State Administration of Work
Safety, told Xinhua the Gaomendong Coal Mine in Jiaxian County
was operating illegally, when the accident happened. The mine's
owner, Lou Gaofeng, has been detained.

<P>
"Although the mine's production license is valid until November
2009, the mine was undergoing a technical innovation for
expansion, which has yet to be approved for resuming production,"
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The safety production agency also said the mine's owner, Lou, did
not report the accident until two hours after it occurred.
</P>
<P>
Miners found water seeping into the shaft before it flooded at
about 7:20 a.m. Monday. There were 42 people working underground
at the time. Eight managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
Jiaxian, about 200 km southwest of the provincial capital
Zhengzhou, is rich in mineral resources with an estimated coal
reserve of about 2 billion tons, according to the county
government website (www.jiaxian.gov.cn).
