Massey Energy Co.'s chief executive threatened to shoot an ABC
News producer and tore his shirt collar when the newsman made an
unannounced attempt to interview him in the coal company's
parking lot, a network spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But CEO Don Blankenship said the scuffle happened after the
producer put a camera too close to his face.
</P>
<P>
ABC is working on a story about Blankenship's relationship with
state Supreme Court Chief Justice Elliott "Spike" Maynard. The
two were photographed vacationing in Monaco in July 2006 while
Massey had cases pending before the court.
</P>
<P>
The network plans to air footage next week that shows Blankenship
telling the unidentified producer, "If you're going to start
taking pictures of me, you're liable to get shot," ABC spokesman
Jeffrey Schneider said. Blankenship then moved quickly toward the
producer, grabbed his camera and snapped off a microphone before
putting his hand's to the man's throat and tearing his shirt
collar, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
Blankenship offered a different version of events, saying the
producer followed his Cadillac into the parking lot, got out,
trained a camera on him and put it too close to his face. "I
reached up and moved the camera aside a little bit and he took
great offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blankenship said the producer grabbed his arm and he grabbed the
producer's chest to keep his balance. Blankenship said he moved
the producer toward his car and repeatedly asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not remember saying the producer might be shot,
though he does not dispute that comment.
</P>
<P>
Schneider said the producer attempted the interview in the
parking lot of Blankenship's office in eastern Kentucky after
unsuccessful attempts to arrange a face to face meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said ABC also interviewed Maynard and expects to run the story
next week.
</P>
<P>
Neither side plans to press charges.
</P>
<P>
Based in Richmond, Virginia, Massey is the nation's fourth-
largest coal producer by revenue. It operates 19 mining complexes
in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
