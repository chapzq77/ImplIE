KUWAIT CITY, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The price of Kuwaiti crude oil increased by 90 U.S. cents to
49.78 U.S. dollars per barrel (dpb) on Monday, Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation (KPC) announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the KPC, despite an rising tendency in the past a
few weeks, the Kuwaiti crude oil price still settled below 50
dpb, a mark it had maintained in the year of 2006.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti crude oil reached its record high on Aug. 8, 2006 when it
hit 68.68 dpb. International oil prices witnessed a swift retreat
from 80 dpb to 50 dpb due to geopolitical and technical factors,
KPC said.
</P>
<P>
Local experts expect international oil prices to decline again
especially with the increasing world oil reserves plus the mild
weather in the northern hemisphere which decreases demand for
heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait as an oil-rich emirate now produces 2.45 million barrels
of crude oil per day.
