with call for unity

Former President Jimmy Carter said he hoped this week's meeting
of Baptists across racial and theological lines could inspire
other churches to end their internal divisions.
</P>
<P>
"If we can do it, maybe all other Christians can do it as well,"
Carter said Wednesday at the start of the gathering. More than
10,000 participants are expected over three days.
</P>
<P>
Carter and other Baptist leaders organized the meeting,
"Celebration of a New Baptist Covenant," to develop common
ministries and to challenge any perception that all Baptists
accept conservative Southern Baptist views.
</P>
<P>
The former president, a longtime Bible teacher at his Plains,
Georgia, church, insisted that the meeting was strictly
religious, not political. It is being held just days before Feb.
5, when more than24 states will hold presidential primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
Former Vice President Al Gore and former President Bill Clinton
are among the keynote speakers. Earlier in the day, at a separate
meeting of four major black Baptist groups, Sens. Barack Obama
and Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke about their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
The black Baptists ended their meeting early so they could join
the Carter-led event, which critics have dismissed as little more
than a Democratic rally. The Rev. William Shaw, president of the
National Baptist Convention USA Inc., the largest of the four
black Baptist denominations, said "this time was set without any
reference to the political calendar."
</P>
<P>
Carter and many others at the Atlanta gathering were once active
in the Southern Baptist Convention but severed ties with its
leaders after conservatives took control in a long, bitter and
very public fight in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Carter said Wednesday that he has been communicating with the
current Southern Baptist president, the Rev. Frank Page, who has
said that he "assured President Carter of my prayers" for the
meeting despite some doubts about its purpose.
</P>
<P>
With 16.3 million members, the Southern Baptist Convention is not
only the largest U.S. Baptist group, but also the largest
Protestant group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The covenant meeting involves 30 Baptist groups from around the
world. They span a range of theological and political beliefs.
Many oppose abortion and same-sex marriage and ordain only men.
However, they also heavily emphasize Bible teaching on social
justice, which will be a major focus of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Northern and Southern Baptists split in 1845, when Northerners
said they would not support missionaries who were slaveholders.
Black Baptists generally formed their own denominations and had
their own splits over civil rights strategies and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Several speakers Wednesday invoked the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. when describing why this meeting was so important.
</P>
<P>
Bill Underwood, president of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia,
a sponsor of the event, said, "I think we are taking a step today
on the long and difficult journey to one day achieving Dr. King's
Dream."
