Chad claims rebel infiltration from Sudan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavily armed rebels crossed into eastern Chad from Sudan on
Wednesday, the government said Thursday, a month after a failed
rebel attempt to overthrow President Idriss Deby Itno's regime.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan on Wednesday launched several heavily armed (rebel)
columns against Chad. These mercenaries crossed the border in the
area of Moudeina," north of the border town of Ade, it said on
national radio.
</P>
<P>
Deby, whose regime accuses Khartoum of supporting Chadian rebels,
was in Senegal's capital Dakar on Thursday where he was to sign a
peace accord later in the day with Sudanese President Omar al-
Beshir.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are in Dakar this week for a summit of
Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The infiltration would be repeat of an incursion that saw rebel
columns in pick- up trucks ride into N'Djamena on February 2 and
3 to overthrow Deby, who took shelter in his palace as street
fighting raged.
