UN business summit aims to make companies more responsible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon opens Thursday one
of the world body's biggest meetings with business leaders to try
to sharpen global standards for corporate behaviour.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 senior executives are registered for the two-day
meeting of the UN's Global Compact, a controversial seven year-
old partnership set up by Ban's predecessor Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Compact is aimed at harnessing globalisation by getting the
private sector to voluntarily improve social and environmental
practices.
</P>
<P>
Government officials including French Foreign Minister Bernard
Kouchner, civil society groups and labour leaders are also due to
take part in the gathering, which will discuss issues ranging
from labour relations to climate change.
</P>
<P>
Top business participants due in Geneva include Neville Isdell,
chief executive of Coca Cola, the Managing Director of India's
Tata Steel, B. Muthuraman and Anne Lauvergeon of French nuclear
giant Areva.
</P>
<P>
A 100-strong Chinese business delegation is also expected.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 companies have now signed up to the Compact's ten
principles covering employment standards, human rights, anti-
corruption measures and the environment, according to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Officials argue that most of the companies on board no longer
simply pay lip service to the partnership.
</P>
<P>
"That has fundamentally changed, there has been a significant
shift towards quality," the Compact's Executive Director Georg
Kell told journalists.
</P>
<P>
However, human rights and development campaigners are still
sharply critical of the Compact.
</P>
<P>
The UN's first ever survey on the Compact published this week
also revealed major shortcomings in a sample of about 400
participants, especially in two key fields -- human rights and
anti-corruption -- despite overall progress.
</P>
<P>
At least one of the companies with participants registered for
the meeting, electric engineering giant Siemens, is embroiled in
corruption investigations in Germany, including on suspicion of
setting up a slush-fund to obtain foreign contracts.
</P>
<P>
The British- based group Action Aid said the Global Compact had
failed to stop corporate human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
"The UN's Global Compact is flawed because it's entirely
voluntary," said the group's trade head, Aftab Alam Khan, calling
for legally-binding regulations on some 77,000 multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a mockery because several companies violating human
rights have been free to join and remain in the Global Compact --
benefiting from an association with the UN," Khan added in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Action Aid notably questioned the role played by subsidiaries of
mining giant Anglo American -- who's chairman Mark Moody-Stuart
is on the Compact's advisory council -- in Ghana and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kell said the United Nations delisted 600 companies last year for
the first time and another 500 could be removed this year because
of shortcomings in their reporting on implementation of the
Compact's principles.
