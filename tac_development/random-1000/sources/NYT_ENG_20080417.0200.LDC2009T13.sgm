Doc shows the real Middle East By Tom Long  Detroit News Film
Critic
</P>
<P>
Documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock comes roaring out of the
gate so furiously at the beginning of "Where in the World Is
Osama Bin Laden?" you wonder how he's going to keep the energy
up.
</P>
<P>
Well, he doesn't, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
Spurlock grabs your attention in the film's opening 15 minutes
with a mad attack of bells and whistles and graphics and jokes.
He even displays full-on videogame graphics in which he battles
Osama. And then he settles into a calmer, more contemplative
groove as the film progresses.
</P>
<P>
Of course this is somewhat unavoidable since he spends the
balance of movie traveling through the Middle East. The sobering
side of life is hard to ignore when you're wearing a bulletproof
vest in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Spurlock, the jaunty guy who overdosed on fast food to grand
documentary success in "Super Size Me," begins "Osama" with the
news that his longtime love, Alexandria, is pregnant. Suddenly
he's struck by how dangerous a world their child will be
entering. So he sets out to make it safer by hunting down Osama.
</P>
<P>
This eventually leads to him doing things like walking through a
Middle-Eastern mall asking people if they've seen Osama, and
standing outside a cave in Afghanistan, yelling in, "Yoo-hoo!
Osama?" Yes, modern documentary sarcasm is alive and well in
Morgan Spurlock.
</P>
<P>
But so is modern humanism. Because in reality what Spurlock shows
in "Osama" is that the majority of regular Muslim folk in the
many countries he visits -- Israel, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt,
Jordan -- have no use for Osama and his tactics. Most actually
consider him a major pain in the butt.
</P>
<P>
Not that they're all enthusiastic about America these days, and
the terrorists do have their sympathizers. But they are
comparatively few. Most want nothing to do with religious feuding
and blame politicians for the ungodly messes going on in Iraq,
Palestine, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Spurlock isn't really looking for Osama; he's looking for the
people Americans mistake for Osama, the people too easily lumped
together under a convenient, misleading banner.
</P>
<P>
And although "Osama" wraps up a bit too quickly, and ends a bit
too obviously, the thing Spurlock finds is, for the most part,
these people resemble us.
