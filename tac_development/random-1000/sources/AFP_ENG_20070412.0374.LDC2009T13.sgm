ECB chief says markets not wrong in betting on June rate hike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Thursday
that the financial markets were not wrong in betting on a further
rise in eurozone interest rates in June.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June
rate rise were correct, Trichet said: "I will not say anything to
change market expectations over the next one or two months."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Frenchman insisted that the ECB had not "pre-
committed" to any pre-set timetable of interest rate moves.
</P>
<P>
The bank, known as the guardian of the euro, held its benchmark
"refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent at its regular
monthly policy-setting meeting on Thursday, just a month after
raising them by a quarter of a percentage point to their highest
level in five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten
monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the
overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi
to 4.0 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Trichet said that "there was no discussion" within the ECB's
policy-making governing council of possible move this month.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold rates steady was "unanimous", he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even at the current level of interest rates, the
ECB's monetary policy stance remained "on the accommodative
side", Trichet said. And the bank would "act in a firmly and
timely manner" to safeguard price stability in the euro area, he
promised.
