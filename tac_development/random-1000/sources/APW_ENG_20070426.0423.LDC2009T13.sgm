Two suicide bombers attacked an office of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani, leader of the autonomous
Kurdish region in Iraq, on Thursday, killing three of its guards
and wounding five, police said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties could have been higher if guards had not opened
fire on the two attackers, one in a car followed by another in a
truck, forcing them to detonate their explosives at least 50
meters (yards) from the office, police said.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at about 8 a.m. in Zumar, a town that is 70
kilometers (45 miles) west of Mosul, the capital of Ninevah
province.
</P>
<P>
It was the second suicide attack this week aimed at the KDP in
that area.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a suicide car bomber attacked a KDP office in another
town near Mosul, which is 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of
Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and wounding 20.
</P>
<P>
In a separate attack in Mosul on Monday, suspected insurgents
assassinated a local KDP official in a drive-by-shooting, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Across Iraq on Wednesday, 45 people died in attacks by suspected
insurgents or militias, including four police officers who were
killed when a suicide bomber struck a police station in Balad
Ruz, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The city is located in Diyala province, which has seen some of
the worst violence recently as mostly Sunni militants are
believed to have fled to the area since U.S. and Iraqi troops
launched a security crackdown in Baghdad on Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, a double truck-bombing killed nine U.S.
soldiers in the volatile province. An al-Qaida-linked group
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a funeral procession was held in Baghdad's Shiite
neighborhood of Sadr City for an Iraqi who locals said was killed
in an attack by the U.S. Air Force early that morning. Associated
Press Television News footage showed three large craters in the
ground of the commercial area and the windows of some of its
stores had been blown out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military said it was checking the report, but could not
immediately confirm it.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr joined
growing criticism of a 3-mile-long, 12-foot-high (5-kilometer-
long, 3 1/2-meter- wide) concrete wall the U.S. military is
building in Azamiyah, a Sunni stronghold of Baghdad that has been
targeted by mortar and rocket attacks by Shiite militiamen. Al-
Sadr called the wall a "sectarian, racist and unjust" plot by the
Americans to divide Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr supporters also demonstrated in Sadr City, chanting "No,
no to division."
</P>
<P>
Others carried a banner that read, "the building of the Baghdad
wall is the beginning of Baghdad's division."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr's Mahdi militia has been blamed for much of the sectarian
bloodshed the U.S. says the Azamiyah wall is designed to stop.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, an al-Sadr aide, Sheik Salah al-Obaidi, told
reporters in the Shiite holy city of Najaf that other
demonstrations were planned in Baghdad to condemn the wall. He
said that if security permits, al-Sadr's followers would like to
join Sunni demonstrators in Azamiyah.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr, apparently seeking to shore up his political support,
has been trying to make overtures to the Sunni minority while
distinguishing between ordinary Sunnis and extremists who target
Shiites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has said al-Sadr is in neighboring Iran,
despite insistence by his aides that he is in hiding in Iraq. Al-
Obaidi said al-Sadr was in hiding "for security reasons" and that
"it is not necessary to know where he is."
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the U.S. military said an American soldier died
the day before in a non-combat related incident. No further
details were released.
