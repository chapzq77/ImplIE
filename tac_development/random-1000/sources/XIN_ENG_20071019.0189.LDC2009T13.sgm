Leaders of the European Union (EU) wrapped up their two-day

EU decision-making and pledges to better deal with challenges of
globalization.

"We've managed to complete our plan at the summit," Jose
Socrates, prime minister of Portugal, which holds the rotating EU
presidency, told reporters at the end of the summit.

"We had a treaty yesterday, and today we went straight into high
quality debate on the real issue for the future ... the issue of
how Europe can successfully rise to the challenges of
globalization, " he said.

He said the EU is ready to tackle the challenges of globalization
and intends to "lead" the world debate on globalization, in three
areas in particular.

The three areas are redesigning of global institutions, the
globalization agenda, which should be an agenda of innovation but
not of isolation or protectionism, and the environmental issue,
especially climate change.

stability of the EU financial market.
