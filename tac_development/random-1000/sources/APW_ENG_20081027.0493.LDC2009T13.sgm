IMF loan to Ukraine hinges on political crisis

Leaders of clashing Ukrainian parliamentary factions on Monday
discussed legislation required to receive a crucial $16.5 billion
loan from the International Monetary Fund as the country
struggles to stay afloat amid a severe financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The IMF made the loan conditional on the passage of laws aimed at
boosting the shaken banking sector, but the deepening political
crisis threatens to torpedo the deal.
</P>
<P>
The work of the Verkhovna Rada has been blocked all last week by
allies of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is fighting an
order by President Viktor Yushchenko to hold early parliamentary
elections in December.
</P>
<P>
Experts hope the IMF loan, which amounts to nearly half of the
country's current foreign currency reserves, will shore up the
shaken financial sector and give the central bank the necessary
reserves to defend the falling national currency, the hryvna,
which has plunged over 20 percent in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"This will allow the National Bank to counter the devaluation
pressures on the hryvna," said Olena Bilan, a macroeconomics
analyst with Dragon Capital investment bank.
</P>
<P>
The hryvna plunged to a historic low of 6.01 to the dollar last
week after a 40 percent fall in exports and a run on banks that
stripped the banking sector of $3.4 billion this month as
Ukrainians rushed to convert their savings into dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Ukraine is in for a painful economic downturn.
Output in the steel industry, which accounts for 6 percent of the
GDP and 40 percent of the country's exports, was down by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's main automobile producer, the Zaporizhye Automobile
Building Plant, said Monday its output fell by 8.6 percent in
September compared to last year's figures. The State Energy
Regulating Committee announced that Ukrainians faced a 35 percent
hike for house heating and cooking gas bills, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
The stock market, which lost over 75 percent this year, after
gaining 130 percent in 2007, opened with further losses of about
2 percent in morning trading Monday.
