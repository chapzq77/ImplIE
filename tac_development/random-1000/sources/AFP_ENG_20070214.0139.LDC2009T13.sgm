Indonesia fails to protect maids: Amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia is failing to protect millions of domestic workers,
some as young as 12, who face long hours, potentially deadly
beatings and sexual abuse, Amnesty International said in a report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 2.6 million domestic workers in Indonesia are
generally considered second-class citizens, the London-based
rights watchdog said.
</P>
<P>
"Too many women domestic workers in Indonesia ... face human
rights abuses at work," said the report entitled Exploitation and
abuse: the plight of women domestic workers.
</P>
<P>
"Often forced to work from as young as 12 years of age, they
suffer economic exploitation and poor working conditions, as well
as gender-based discrimination. Many are subjected to physical,
psychological and sexual violence. Some are even killed."
</P>
<P>
The report details cases of women and girls who were abused,
raped and even beaten to death by their employers.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty said their plight often remained hidden, as they were
ashamed of talking about their experiences, and the authorities
and general public appeared oblivious to them.
</P>
<P>
"By contrast, the plight of Indonesian domestic workers in other
parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East often makes headlines
in Indonesia," it said.
</P>
<P>
Some 640,000 Indonesians work abroad, mostly as maids, with
Malaysia one of the top destinations.
</P>
<P>
"We often think of domestic workers as people travelling out of
Indonesia to other countries, but there is a large population of
Indonesian domestic workers in their own country, who are not
recognised by law," Amnesty International Malaysia executive
director Josef Roy Benedict told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"This means they are not able to form trade unions or get any
help legally."
</P>
<P>
Government moves to address the problem were falling short, the
report said, "leaving millions of women vulnerable to abusive
employers."
</P>
<P>
While the government had submitted a draft law on domestic
workers, it omitted basic rights given to other workers such as
limits on working hours and a minimum wage, and most people were
also unaware that a law on domestic violence applied to maids,
Amnesty said.
</P>
<P>
"Like every other human being, domestic workers have rights --
including the right to be free from violence, the right to rest
and the right to be paid an adequate wage. The government is
currently failing to protect these rights," Amnesty deputy Asia
director Natalie Hill said.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty called on the government to ensure maids received the
same protection as other workers.
</P>
<P>
"The government needs to stop viewing domestic workers as
inferior and give them the same legal protections as other
workers. It also needs to educate police, the courts, employers
and recruitment agencies on the fact that violence against
domestic workers is a criminal offence," Hill said.
