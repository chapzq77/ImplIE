Myanmar threatens pro-democracy group over protests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's military rulers Sunday threatened to take "effective
action" against pro-democracy supporters who have staged a rare
string of anti-junta protests across the country over the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The secretive regime took the unusual step of issuing a statement
directly to the news media, accusing the National League for
Democracy (NLD) of trying to instigate nationwide unrest.
</P>
<P>
"They agitated through various means to instigate riots and
unrest among the people. The NLD conspired to create this
situation to derail the national political process," it said.
</P>
<P>
The government also blamed the party, which is headed by the
detained Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for inciting
Buddhist monks in the central town of Pakokku to destroy the
homes and shops of pro-junta militia leaders.
</P>
<P>
The monks also held about 20 government officials hostage for
several hours on Thursday, in the most dramatic standoff with the
regime since the protests broke out on August 19.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, the government will never tolerate
such malicious acts and will take effective action against those
committing such acts in accordance with the existing law," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Normally such statements would be filtered through official
media, sometimes several days later, but the three-page document
dated Saturday was given directly to journalists on Sunday and
reported immediately in the state press.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have
been arrested over the protests, which were sparked by a massive
hike in fuel prices last month.
</P>
<P>
The government again defended the price hike in the statement
Sunday, saying it was necessary because of high world oil prices
that had made fuel subsidies unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's crackdown on dissent has sparked an international
outcry, with US President George W. Bush lashing the junta as
"tyrannical."
