Germany, which holds the European Union presidency, voiced
concern Friday over Iran's recent human rights record, citing the
imposition by force of stricter dress codes and the "worsening
situation" of minorities, among other worries.

<P>
The 27-nation EU "is particularly troubled by the recent wave of
arrests of civil society and women's rights activists," Germany
said in a statement on behalf of the bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers, students, union members, scholars and journalists
exercising their right to freely express their opinion are facing
constant intimidation, and stricter dress codes for men and women
are being imposed by force," it added.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners in Iran, which is at odds with the West over its
nuclear program, have taken advantage of the confrontation to
crack down on opponents and launch morality campaigns like one in
which women were arrested for not meeting Islamic dress codes.
</P>
<P>
Germany's statement said that "the EU also wishes to draw
attention to the worsening of the situation of ethnic and
religious minorities in Iran, in particular to the plight of the
Baha'i, who are excluded from public life, discriminated against
and harassed."

<P>
It also urged Tehran to abolish completely the juvenile death
penalty, amputations and "other cruel punishments, such as
stoning." EU countries have abolished the death penalty.
