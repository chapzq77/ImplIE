Thai police arrested a British man Tuesday and charged him with
distributing hundreds of pornographic photographs of children on
the Internet, police said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Cornelius Jones, 39, who has lived in Thailand for seven
years, was arrested after police raided his Bangkok apartment and
found a computer containing photos of naked boys and girls, said
police Col. Apichart Suribunya, head of Thailand's liaison office
for Interpol, the international police agency.
</P>
<P>
Thai police acted on a tip-off from their British counterparts,
who told them Jones had been sending photos of naked children to
Britain over the Internet, Apichart said.
</P>
<P>
Police said Jones has been working as a teacher at a Bangkok
private school.
</P>
<P>
Jones, of Cardiff, Wales, has been charged with distributing
pornographic photographs of children under age 15, which carries
a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Apichart said.
</P>
<P>
Another officer in the Thai Interpol office, Maj. Phongphon
Iamwicharn, said that Jones did not appear in the photos, and
that there was evidence he had sold the pictures.

Thai police arrested Christopher Paul Neil of Canada on Oct. 19
on charges of having sex with several young Asian boys after
Interpol issued an unprecedented worldwide appeal to identify and
apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
Interpol began its manhunt after finding about 200 pictures on
the Internet of Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese boys being
sexually abused by a man whose face was digitally obscured.
</P>
<P>
After German police computer experts unscrambled the photos so
the man's face was recognizable, Interpol circulated them
publicly. Tip-offs led them to identify Neil as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
He has been charged with child sexual abuse, but police are still
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
Neil has also worked as a teacher at schools in Thailand, South
Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Jones and Neil are both in Thai police custody.
</P>
<P>
Several Southeast Asian countries are popular among pedophiles
and sex abusers because of poverty that drives children and their
parents to accept money for sexual favors, and sometimes because
of lax law enforcement.
