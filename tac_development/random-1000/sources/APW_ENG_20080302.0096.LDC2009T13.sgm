Giuseppe Verdi was worried about "all those dead bodies" in his
"La forza del destino." On Saturday, there weren't enough for
some in the audience.
</P>
<P>
"Verdi's assassins," yelled someone in the audience after a
particularly jarring scene. He and others booing the performance
were clearly calling for the head of producer David Pountney and
others responsible for the new production of "La forza" for
savaging the Italian maestro with their all-too-free
interpretation of his opera classic.
</P>
<P>
True, some of the settings in this Vienna State Opera production
were more "Stagecoach" than opera. Lightly clad cowgirls hefting
six-guns were stand-ins for the camp followers of the soldiers in
the Verdi opera. Tableaux of military life were turned into
grisly portraits of Hell with a touch of Bosch, mixed with T.S.
Eliot.
</P>
<P>
And Pountney's skeptical view of religion made the final moments
of the hero's reconciliation with God, Heaven and the death of
his beloved Leonora a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
Adding to difficulties is that even without Pountney, this opera
calls for an indulgent audience ready to accept a plot almost as
cliche as the notion of "it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
</P>
<P>
Don Alvaro, the hero, is caught in the bedroom of Leonora by her
father. As he drops his pistol in submission it goes off, killing
the elderly nobleman and setting into notion the "power of
destiny" that ultimately leads to two more deaths; that of
Leonora's brother by the hero and of Leonora herself, killed by
her brother literally as he expires from the sword wound
inflicted by Alvaro.
</P>
<P>
Originally the hero himself was to commit suicide. Perhaps
fearful of the prospect of nobody left to take a curtain call,
Verdi himself wrote co-librettist Maria Piave: "We need to think
about the ending and find some way to avoid all those dead
bodies."
</P>
<P>
So in the version performed Saturday, Alvaro remains alive and
redeemed, though deeply depressed. The fact that the audience was
spared that condition Saturday was due less to the controversial
production and more to the excellence of the musical performances
both on stage and in the pit.
</P>
<P>
No stranger to the score, conductor Zubin Mehta owned the music
from the first throbbing chords of the overture to the "dying"
notes of this performance. Under his baton, the violin section
sounded as if one powerful instrument. His horns packed more
oomph than any brass band. And his woodwinds were tremulous,
breathy and vulnerable, reflecting the pathos of the action under
the spotlights. His cues were perfect, his pauses powerful.
</P>
<P>
The principals also rose to the musical challenge. Nina Stemme
was a wonderful Leonora, with her Wagner-honed heroic soprano the
perfect instrument for the vocal athletics called for by Verdi.
Her voice was fully rounded, powerful and evocative at all
levels. Complementing her sound was her excellent dramatic
rendering of the heroine doomed by destiny. Among her highlights
on Saturday: "Madre pietosa Vergine." (Holy Mother hear my
prayer.)
</P>
<P>
The sporadic boos mixed with the bravos for Salvatore Licitra
were undeserved. His warm and broad tenor was a lovely match for
Stemme, making him a thoroughly enjoyable Alvaro.
</P>
<P>
But the best male role of the evening was given by Carlos
Alvarez. As Don Carlo, Leonora's vengeful brother, his rich and
vibrant baritone, coupled with a menacing and possessed stage
presence, had all eyes and ears focused on him, at times even
when he was not at center stage.
</P>
<P>
Also good: the choir, under Thomas Lang; Alastair Miles as
Leonora's father and the father superior; Tiziano Bracci as
Melitone, the friar, and Nadia Krasteva as Preziosilla, the camp
fortuneteller who in Pountney's version turns into a pistol-
packing, hotpants-wearing Annie Oakley.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's performance was a mix of obsession, revenge, love and
madness on stage; hatred from some audience members incensed with
the production, and redemption, as in the healing power of
wonderful music on stage and in the pit.
</P>
<P>
All in all, a powerful night at the opera.
