RECONSIDERING, TORRE ADMONISHES RODRIGUEZ

Politically, it would have been easy for Yankees manager Joe
Torre to defend Alex Rodriguez for distracting a Toronto fielder
by shouting as he ran past him on the bases Wednesday night. But
with two days to think about it, Torre admonished Rodriguez on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably something he shouldn't have done," Torre said
before the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox. "But it's over
with. I don't sense he's going to do it again. Just the reaction
probably told him that. He may have been excited about the fact
that we were leading the ballgame. It was probably inappropriate
to do it at the time he did it. But you can't change it,
unfortunately."
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told Rodriguez on the field that
he had made a bush league play, something more appropriate for a
Little Leaguer, and repeated those assertions to reporters after
the game. Several other Blue Jays were furious at Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
"They were angry, no question," Torre said. "I can't say I blame
them."
</P>
<P>
Torre, who gave a lukewarm defense of Rodriguez immediately after
Wednesday's game, said he spoke with Rodriguez that night about
the play.
</P>
<P>
"I sensed from our conversation it won't happen again," Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez did not make himself available to reporters after
Torre's comments, but the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson defended
him. Jackson, a special adviser who has spent considerable time
around the clubhouse as the Yankees have struggled, said that
Rodriguez was within his rights to distract Blue Jays third
baseman Howie Clark from catching a pop-up.
</P>
<P>
"If it's not Alex Rodriguez, it's not a story," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson broke up a potential double play in the 1978 World Series
when he froze on the basepaths and turned his hip into a throw.
He said he did it so the ball would not hit him in a more
sensitive spot, but he also said that, like Rodriguez, he was
denounced instead of praised for a play that helped his team.
</P>
<P>
"No over ever gave me credit for making a smart play, because I
wasn't in favor," Jackson said. "They said it was a cheap shot.
Now, A-Rod's not in favor. People won't appreciate him until he's
done. Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him. He comes to
play every day."
