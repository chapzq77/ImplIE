Spanish archbishop knocks coverage of US priest sex scandal
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Vatican's ambassador in Spain accused the country's media of
"discrimination" on Wednesday for giving what he said was too
much attention to a sexual abuse scandal involving priests in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"If you read the newspapers you will find the same cases every
day, sometimes filling an entire page. You see bad intentions
there," Archbishop Manuel Moneteiro de Castro told reporters in
the central Spanish town of Aranjuez.
</P>
<P>
"This is called discrimination, no matter how good one wants to
be," he added.
</P>
<P>
His comments came two days after the Los Angeles archdiocese
agreed to a record 660 million dollar (480 million euro) payout
to 508 people who were sexually abused by priests in cases dating
back to the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The case has dominated headlines in Spain this week. Centre-left
daily El Pais dedicated an entire page to the US priest sex
scandal on Wednesday under the headline: "The abuse that did not
go to trial".
</P>
<P>
Spain has passed from being a bastion of Roman Catholicism to a
predominantly secular society in less than a generation.
</P>
<P>
While 80 percent of Spaniards call themselves Catholics only one
in five go to mass, according to a study published last year.
</P>
<P>
The Church meanwhile feels under siege from the Socialist
government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which
has legalised gay marriage and taken steps to loosen the ties
between church and state since coming to power in 2004.
</P>
<P>
A full 61 percent of priests feel Zapatero's government is "anti-
clerical", according to a survey published earlier this year.
