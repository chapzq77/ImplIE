British teacher charged with inciting religious hatred in court
for trial

KHARTOUM, Sudan 2007-11-29 13:00:17 UTC
</P>
<P>
Riot police surrounded the building as a Sudanese court began
proceedings Thursday in the case of a British teacher charged
with inciting religious hatred -- a crime punishable by up to 40
lashes -- over letting her pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
Gillian Gibbons, in a dark jacket and blue skirt, was not
handcuffed but looked tired as she walked into the courtroom in
Khartoum, according to reporters inside, before media were
ordered out of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
There was confusion in the crowded courthouse as authorities
barred British diplomats and Gibbons' employer from entering the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's prosecutor-general Salah Eddin Abu Zaid said Gibbons, who
could face also face six months in jail and a fine if convicted,
will receive a "swift and fair trial."
</P>
<P>
The case has sparked tensions between Sudan and Britain, the
country's former colonial ruler. British Foreign Secretary David
Miliband was meeting Thursday with Sudan's ambassador to inquire
about the case.
</P>
<P>
"There is an innocent misunderstanding at the heart of this, not
a criminal offense," Miliband told reporters. British diplomats
"will do everything to avoid" any of the possible sentences that
could be imposed on Gibbons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Unity High School, a private school where
Gibbons teaches, say the teddy bear was part of a class project
to teach her 7-year-old pupils about animals. She asked the
students to name the bear and they chose the name Muhammad, a
common name among Muslim men.
</P>
<P>
Each child was allowed to take the bear home on weekends and
write a diary about what they did with it. The diary entries were
collected in a book with the bear's picture on the cover,
labeled, "My Name is Muhammad," according to the school director,
Robert Boulos.
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after complaints that she
had insulted Prophet Muhammad, the most revered figure in Islam,
by applying his name to a toy animal.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear who made the complaint. Boulos told media earlier
in the week it came from several parents, but on Thursday he told
The Associated Press that police informed him it came from a
staffer at the school.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the case will be dismissed," he said, adding the school
could hire private guards to protect Gibbons' when she returned.
"She is a marvelous teacher, she was even training our other
primary teachers."
</P>
<P>
The school, which has about 750 students from elementary through
high school, most from affluent Sudanese Muslim families, has
been closed since her arrest.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's top Muslim clerics on Wednesday demanded the government
punish her, saying she intentionally insulted the prophet and
comparing her action to the "blasphemies" of author Salman
Rushdie. Hard-liners have considerable weight in the government
of President Omar al-Bashir, which came to power in a 1989
military coup that touted itself as creating an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons' chief defense lawyer Kamal Djizouri scuffled with police
in the tight cordon outside the courtroom before he was allowed
in. He briefly came out to say the proceedings were postponed as
the plaintiff had not yet shown up.
</P>
<P>
Boulos said the plaintiff was the Sudanese ministry of education.
</P>
<P>
Djizouri, the lawyer, told The AP he would argue her case on the
basis of Islamic Sharia law to show there was "absolutely no
intention to insult religion, and for blasphemy to take place
there must be an insult."
</P>
<P>
"There is a very big difference between the holy character of
Prophet Muhammad and the name Muhammad given to a person," he
said, pointing out that it is the most widespread first name in
the Arab world. "When somebody is named Muhammad by his parents
and then turns out to be a thief, is it an insult to religion to
say, 'That Muhammad is a thief'? Of course not."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the trial would be finished Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hearings in Sudan are usually public, but police barred entry,
including to British diplomats who had come to observe. "It's up
to the judge, but from a consular point of view, we would like to
be present," British Consul Russell Philipps said amid a crowd of
about 100 people, mostly media, trying to get in.
</P>
<P>
Episcopalian Bishop Ezekiel Kondo, Gibbons' employer, also
barred, said he was there "as a witness to testify that she never
intended to insult any religion." He denied reports that the
school had fired Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's Foreign Ministry has sought to play down the case, and
the embassy in London initially predicted she would not be
charged. Embassy spokesman Khalid al Mubarak said Thursday he did
not expect her to be convicted.
</P>
<P>
But there were signs the case could become a rallying case for
Islamic hard-liners. Wednesday evening, a pickup truck drove
through Khartoum with loudspeakers calling on Sudanese to defend
their religion and hold a protest Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the first reports on the case in Sudanese papers Thursday,
some articles echoing angry statements by the clerics -- though
others said Gibbons should be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The semiofficial Assembly of the Ulemas, or Islamic clerics, said
Wednesday that Gibbon's action was "another ring in the circles
of plotting against Islam" -- citing Rushdie and insulting
caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad run in European newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The British novelist was accused of blasphemy by many Muslims for
his 1988 novel "The Satanic Verses," which had a character seen
as a reference to the prophet. Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict calling for Rushdie's death.
</P>
<P>
The north of Sudan bases its legal code on Islamic Sharia law,
and President al-Bashir often seeks to burnish his religious
credentials.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he vowed to lead a jihad, or holy war, against U.N.
peacekeepers if they deployed in the Darfur region of western
Sudan. He relented this year to allow a U.N.-African Union force
there -- but this month said he would bar Scandinavian
peacekeepers from participating because newspapers in their
countries ran the cartoons.
