Japan swept the top two places at the World Figure Skating
Championships, with Miki Ando taking the title and wonderkid Mao
Asada the silver after South Korea's Kim Yu-na fell twice in her
final skate.
</P>
<P>
Ando, 19, didn't do a much-anticipated quad, but her seven
triples to a violin concerto by Mendelssohn gave her a total
overall score of 195.09. Asada won Saturday's free skating, but
was just fifth entering the final event and scored 194.45 for
second overall.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would end up at the top of the podium," Ando
said. "So I was very happy to hear I won the gold medal."
</P>
<P>
Kim, last year's junior world champion, led after marking a
record 71.95 in the short program, but finished third with 186.14
after a disastrous 30 seconds in the middle of her routine.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes into her routine, she looked like she had the title.
</P>
<P>
But she then fell on the first jump of what was to be a three-
jump combination. She fell again and had another combination
ruled scoreless because it was too many.
</P>
<P>
Ando's victory is another big skating crown for Japan. Shizuka
Arakawa won the Olympic title last year and the world title in
2004.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to have won the title in my home country," Ando
said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
Skating last, after Asada had stirred the crowd with her high
score, Ando kept her poise and delivered a solid performance that
was good enough to maintain her winning margin.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Asada, the world junior champion in 2005, tried a
triple axel, but was slightly two-footed on her landing. She also
underrotated a combination.
</P>
<P>
Under the intense pressure of the home-country expectations,
Asada came back powerfully, going through her routine to
Hungarian music and ending with a three-jump combination in the
final 30 seconds that earned bonus points under the new system.
</P>
<P>
She beat Ando in the free skating 133.13 to 127.11.
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed by myself," Asada said. "I love skating at
home."
</P>
<P>
The audience roared at her every jump, cheering even more than
they did later for Ando.
</P>
<P>
Kim, skating with a back injury, was clearly disappointed by her
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
"My condition was worse today. My legs felt heavy. But I had a
good season and I am happy with it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kim won the Grand Prix final over Asada and Ando last December.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Kimmie Meissner of the United States was
fourth, scoring 180.23.
</P>
<P>
Meissner, skating a flamenco routine, had a couple of jumps
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
"It was not my best. I can do better," Meissner said. "So I will
regroup and come back next year."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Meissner dazzled in the free skating to win after the
Olympics as the stars in Turin failed to show up or faltered in
the worlds.
</P>
<P>
The championships ended with the gold medals spread among four
countries.
</P>
<P>
France's Brian Joubert won the men's. China's Shen Xue and Zhao
Hongbo won the pairs and Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski of
Bulgaria captured the pairs.
</P>
<P>
Japan had more medals than any other country, with three. Daisuke
Takahashi won silver in the men's.
