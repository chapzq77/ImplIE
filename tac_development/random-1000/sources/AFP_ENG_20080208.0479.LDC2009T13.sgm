Golf: Tiger has golfers sprinting for the gym
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ultra-fit Tiger Woods has got his fellow pros sprinting for the
gym as the world number one takes the game into new territory.
</P>
<P>
Professional golfers have never been known as the fittest
sportsman in the world, but all that is changing as a direct
results of Woods' example.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt, I listen to a few of the older pros talk about
the differences in the Tour in the past few years," said up-and-
coming Irishman Graeme McDowell.
</P>
<P>
"Especially like when we stay in hotels -- in Abu Dhabi a couple
of weeks ago you went to the gym at four or five o'clock and
there's 20 players in there.
</P>
<P>
"The shape of the Tour has changed, Tiger has raised the bar from
a physical level, he's the guy we all look to.
</P>
<P>
"He could probably have been a great American football player and
he probably could have done anything because he's got the
athletic capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"He's beat himself into unbelievable shape and seems to be
getting better all the time. I think that has spurred guys into
the gym and has us all lifting weights and working harder and
running."
