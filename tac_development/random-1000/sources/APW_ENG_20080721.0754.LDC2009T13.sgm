BLACKBURN, England 2008-07-21 14:48:57 UTC

Blackburn chairman John Williams said two offers to buy David
Bentley have failed to meet his valuation of the England winger.
</P>
<P>
Bids by Tottenham and Aston Villa for the 23-year-old Bentley
were rejected, but even if an attractive offer is made, manager
Paul Ince will be left to decide whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
"We have received two bids but neither have come anywhere close
to our valuation which is based in line with how we see the
market," Williams said Monday. "We don't want to lose David, but
if we do get a bid that meets our valuation then ultimately it
comes down to a football decision by Paul.
</P>
<P>
"David is one year into a four-year contract, but he told us when
(manager) Mark Hughes was here that he wanted a move so this
doesn't come as a shock to us."
