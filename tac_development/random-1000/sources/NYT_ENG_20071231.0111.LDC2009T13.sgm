HUCKABEE PULLS NEGATIVE AD AS CANDIDATES GET OUT FINAL IOWA
MESSAGES

<P>
DES MOINES - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, reeling
under a negative TV ad campaign from rival Mitt Romney, said
Monday he made a last-minute decision to pull an anti-Romney ad
he had shipped to Iowa stations.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially
planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still
managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by
showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge gamble on my part. We'll see how it turns out,"
Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional
political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do
damage the smart play is to hit back."
</P>
<P>
"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to
fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll
probably be the last guy to ever do this."
</P>
<P>
"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said,
appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads
despite the fact that history indicates they work.
</P>
<P>
As Huckabee and Romney sparred for the lead as the Thursday
caucuses approach, a new poll showed a virtual three-way dead
heat on the Democratic side, with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton
maintaining a slight lead over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and
former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who has the momentum.
</P>
<P>
Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as
Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he
pardoned.
</P>
<P>
Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in
poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner
status in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
A McClatchy/MSNBC poll conducted Dec. 3-6 showed Huckabee in
first place, 12 points ahead of runner-up Romney. But last week,
the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was
second.
</P>
<P>
At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's
news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign; and on the
other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people
promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
And I think that's a very confusing and puzzling message," he
said, referring to the news coverage that is sure to spread the
Huckabee ad's message.
</P>
<P>
Madden branded Huckabee's decision to pull the ad but show it at
a news conference as "a bizarre display of hypocrisy."
</P>
<P>
Huckabee told reporters he showed them the ad because if he
didn't, "you'd say, 'Where's the ad?"
</P>
<P>
The ad was produced Sunday and shipped to Iowa stations to begin
airing Monday. It made several points about Romney, including his
previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that
included a co-payment for abortions.
</P>
<P>
"Iowans have a right to know the truth about Mitt Romney's
dishonest attacks on me and an American hero, John McCain,"
Huckabee says on the ad. "If a man's dishonest to obtain a job,
he'll be dishonest on the job."
</P>
<P>
University of Iowa political scientist Peverill Squire said
Huckabee's move "suggests the campaign is a bit more amateur than
its competition."
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking
up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, a Reuters-C-SPAN-Zogby poll released
Monday and conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Clinton at 30
percent among likely caucus-goers; Obama and Edwards each were at
26 percent. The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, making
it a statistical three-way tie. A previous poll last week had
Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
</P>
<P>
Edwards is pushing a populist message that is finding a receptive
audience in Iowa. In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti-
Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's
lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's
a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
</P>
<P>
Clinton targeted Edwards during a stop in Keokuk, apparently
mocking his animated attacks on special interests.
</P>
<P>
"It's not something you have to do by yelling and screaming. Save
your energy. Get the job done," she said about battles in
Washington. "Instead of generating a lot of heat, rolling your
hands and jumping up and down, sit down and figure out how we're
going to beat them."
</P>
<P>
For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest
brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as
first lady amounted to chatting over tea. Over the weekend, she
responded sharply to these jabs, noting that she was the first
high-level American to go to Bosnia after the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
"We landed in one of those cork screw landings and ran out
because they said there might be sniper fire - I don't remember
anyone offering me tea on the tarmac," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Obama suggested his global experience eclipses the
eight years Clinton spent as first lady. "It's that experience,
that understanding, not just of what world leaders I went and
talked to in the ambassador's house I had tea with, but
understanding the lives of the people like my grandmother who
lives in a tiny hut in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout. In Marion
County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and
said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus. My job is to be so
persuasive that you conclude 'I've got to go for Obama. That's my
guy."'
</P>
<P>
All three Democrats found themselves negatively depicted in a
last-minute round of phone calls to likely caucus-goers in Iowa.
In each case, recipients told the Associated Press that a caller
pretending to conduct a poll of candidate preferences began by
asking who the caucus-goer intends to support.
