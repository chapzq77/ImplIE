Australia to host US signals base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia announced Thursday that it had agreed to host a new US
military communications base, calling it a practical expression
of the strong alliance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The base would serve as a ground station for communications with
American military forces throughout the world, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Australia already hosts a major satellite communications base at
Pine Gap outside Alice Springs, which is jointly manned with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"These facilities are fundamental in underpinning and giving
practical effect to the US alliance, and the government is
strongly committed to the alliance as the key guarantee to our
nation's security," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement on the new base, at Kojarena near
Geraldton in Western Australia, were expected to be finalised
within months, Defence Minister Brendan Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes at a time when Australia's alliance with
the United States and its involvement in the Iraq war are
subjects of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard has been accused by the opposition
Labor Party of jeopardising relations by interfering in US
domestic politics as the race to succeed President George W.
Bush, a Republican, gets under way.
</P>
<P>
Howard, a close Bush ally, drew fire in the United States and at
home for suggesting that terrorists would pray for a Democratic
victory after presidential hopeful Barack Obama proposed
withdrawing troops from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has also pressured Howard to announce a withdrawal
plan for Iraq, where Australia has some 1,400 soldiers with the
US-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
Howard has refused, saying that Labor's plan to pull the troops
out if it wins this year's elections is the biggest threat to the
alliance with the US.
