Ex-speaker denounces 'cash-for-votes' in Iran parliament
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former speaker of parliament has denounced reports that Iranian
MPs are being offered government cash to vote against impeaching
the interior minister, who lied about his education, the Mehr
news agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"God save us from money being given to a deputy asking him to
vote for or against someone or for or against a bill," said
Gholam-Ali Hadad Adel, who headed parliament from 2004 until he
stepped down earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Hadad Adel's remarks come two days after a stormy incident in
parliament, in which media reported that a conservative deputy
slapped the government's parliamentary representative, accusing
him of vote buying.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, MPs were being offered cheques for 50
million rials (5,215 dollars, 4,085 euros), ostensibly to benefit
mosques in their districts. However, they were asked to sign an
undertaking not to vote to censure Interior Minister Ali Kordan.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham announced on Friday that
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered the opening of an
investigation, semi-official Fars newsagency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The president has ordered a full inquiry ... If it appears that
an illegal act has been committed, the government will act
without fear or favour," Elham said.
</P>
<P>
Parliament will vote on Tuesday whether to impeach Kordan for
"dishonesty" after he confessed to holding a fake Oxford
University degree.
</P>
<P>
Kordan, who only took office in August, has been under pressure
to resign after the prestigious British university denied
awarding him any qualification through a representative, as he
had claimed.
</P>
<P>
"The minister has claimed to have been deceived by the Oxford
University's representative ... Whether he has been deceived or
dishonest, such a person does not deserve to be interior
minister," reads the censure motion.
</P>
<P>
Kordan later said he had approached Oxford University after MPs
cast doubt on his degree, but "to my utter disbelief, the
university did not confirm (the degree) when my representative
went there."
</P>
<P>
He had shown the purported degree to MPs in a controversial vote
of confidence on August 5, during which he was confirmed by a
vote of 169-100.
</P>
<P>
Kordan replaced Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, who was at odds with
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The president has been supporting
Kordan throughout the controversy.
