Condemnation of Bush Iraq plan mirrors failure to follow Baker
ideas by David Millikin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defying expectations, the new Iraq strategy unveiled by President
George W. Bush this week mirrored many proposals from the
heavyweight Iraq Study Group led by former secretary of state
James Baker.
</P>
<P>
But Bush's refusal to incorporate two of the panel's central
recommendations -- set a target date for beginning to withdraw US
forces from Iraq and seek Iran's and Syria's help to stabilize
the country -- was enough to earn the plan a searing thumbs down
from the president's critics.
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a
"surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military
efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The decision to deepen US involvement in the unpopular war while
foregoing diplomacy drew scathing criticism not only from
opposition Democrats but also from some leaders of Bush's
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's a tragic mistake," said Senator Joseph Biden, a
2008 Democratic presidential hopeful and chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
appeared before the panel Thursday to defend the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the
most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since
Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, the congressionally mandated Iraq Study Group,
co-chaired by Baker, a Republican who served with Bush's father
when he was president, and Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton,
won wide praise for the proposals it submitted in early December.
</P>
<P>
The report focussed on shifting responsibility for ending the
spiralling sectarian violence in Iraq from US to Iraqi forces so
American troops could begin withdrawing by early next year.
</P>
<P>
It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would
involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and
sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and
radicalization across the region.
</P>
<P>
Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some
commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker
report.
</P>
<P>
"From where I sit, Madam Secretary, you are not listening to the
American people, you are not listening to the military ... you
are not listening to the Iraq Study Group," Democratic Senator
Barbara Boxer fumed at Rice Thursdsay.
</P>
<P>
The strategy released by Bush however reflected key elements of
the Baker outline, including a need to boost training of Iraqi
forces by "embedding" more US advisors and making US support
conditional on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government meeting
"benchmarks" for achieving security and political reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri
Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and
reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness
to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Rice met another of the group's main recommendations Thursday
when she named a "czar" to oversee a new, more decentralised push
for economic reconstruction and job creation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She is also due to leave Friday for a tour of the Middle East
that will include talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on
their moribund peace process and efforts to rally moderate Arab
allies to Iraq's aid.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Bush's top diplomat made clear that
diplomacy involving Syria and Iran remained out of the question.
</P>
<P>
Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in
exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist
Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria
would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over
neighboring Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"That's not diplomacy, that's extortion," she said.
</P>
<P>
A former State Department official who was instrumental in the
work of the Iraq Study Group downplayed the differences with
Bush's final plan and suggested the Democrats who now control
Congress could still force the president's hand on the missing
elements.
</P>
<P>
"Its not a repudiation -- there are a lot of things in the plan
that come directly from the Iraq Study Group," said the former
diplomat, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized
to speak publicly on behalf of the group.
</P>
<P>
"On the two really critical points they did not adopt -- a target
date to begin drawing down US troops and talks with Syria and
Iran -- those are points that many people in Congress will press,
so they're not dead," he said.
