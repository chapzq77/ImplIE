The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning Sunday
afternoon for ships operating in seas south and southeast of
Taiwan as Tropical Storm Hagupit intensified into a typhoon and
headed northwest toward the southern tip of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
CWB meteorologists pointed out that as of 5 p.m. Sunday, the
center of Hagupit -- the 14th storm in the Western Pacific this
year --  was located about 710 km southwest of Eluanbi,  Taiwan's
southernmost tip.
</P>
<P>
They said that Hagupit, which has a radius of 250 km, was moving
northwest at a speed of 21 kph and is likely to change direction
slightly toward west- northwest. It had maximum sustained winds
of 118.8 kph near the center, with gusts reaching 154.8 kph.
</P>
<P>
The meteorologists also said that the CWB will not rule out the
possibility of issuing a land warning soon for Typhoon Hagupit to
alert residents in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB forecast, Typhoon Hagupit is expected to
move swiftly across the Bashi Channel and reach the waters
southeast of Taiwan Monday, and that Taiwan's southeast region
and the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area in southern Taiwan will begin to
see rain from Monday afternoon, with the storm intensifying until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CWB urged people in southern Taiwan to prepare enough food
and water for seven days and avoid going outdoors unless
absolutely necessary in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The storm was first spotted Sept. 14 as a tropical disturbance
northeast of Guam. It developed into a minor tropical depression
Sept. 17 as it moved toward the eastern Philippine Sea. The
tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical storm two days
later and given the name Hagupit. It further intensified into a
severe tropical storm Sept. 20 and became a typhoon a day later.
