Bush to sign US-India nuclear deal law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush was to sign legislation on Wednesday
to enact a landmark US-India nuclear deal, in a lavish ceremony
to highlight how the pact helps usher in a new era in relations.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee will make a
surprise visit Friday to Washington so that he and US Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice can formally sign the accord itself, a
senior US official said.
</P>
<P>
Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the deal in
July 2005, touching off a difficult battle with wary lawmakers on
either side and critics who warn it undermines global efforts to
curb the spread of nuclear know-how.
</P>
<P>
The agreement offers India access to sophisticated US technology
and cheap atomic energy in return for allowing UN inspections of
some of its civilian nuclear facilities -- but not military
nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
Washington imposed a ban on US-Indian civilian nuclear trade
after India's first nuclear test in 1974, but US officials have
said a new approach is needed to help the world's largest
democracy meet its booming energy needs at a time of skyrocketing
oil prices and global warming fears.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of Indiaâ€™s
emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved
relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an
independent course from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony on Wednesday will draw Vice President Dick Cheney,
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Energy Secretary Samuel
Bodman, and India's ambassador to Washington, Ronen Sen, to the
White House's ornate East Room.
</P>
<P>
US lawmakers, and roughly 200 guests including Indian-American
community leaders, will also attend the signing ceremony,
according to Bush spokesman Carlton Carroll.
</P>
<P>
Neither Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama nor
Republican rival John McCain were expected to break from
campaigning to attend the signing.
</P>
<P>
"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and
continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership,"
Carroll said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear
nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs,
and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a
responsible manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN
nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which
controls global atomic trade.
</P>
<P>
She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both
Houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of
nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last
week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a
foreign policy success.
</P>
<P>
But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the
spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the
international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Singh also had a rough ride over the deal at home: The main
opposition Hindu nationalists and the Communists have both
slammed it as curbing India's military options and bringing the
country's foreign policy too much under US influence.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi was reluctant to sign the deal before Bush inked the
pact but pledged during Rice's visit to India late last week to
do so soon after.
