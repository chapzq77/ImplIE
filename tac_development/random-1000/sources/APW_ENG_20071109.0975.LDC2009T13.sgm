Stocks fell sharply in early trading Friday after Wachovia Corp.
said it expects to increase quarterly loan losses, raising
investor concern about the continuing credit crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that credit market volatility could cause
a $1.1 billion (euro0.75 billion) writedown for October alone.
The problem stems from its asset-backed securities, such as
collateralized debt obligations, that have lost value on sinking
investor demand.

Investors also were rattled on speculation that Barclays PLC was
about to announce a $10 billion (euro6.81 billion) writedown.
Though the British bank denied the rumors, it demonstrated that
Wall Street continues to worry that the summer's credit turmoil
shows no signs of abating.

<P>
The market was also still on edge after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said Thursday that policy makers expect the U.S.
economy to "slow noticeably" this quarter. His comments caused
major indexes to fall -- contributing to a slide this week on
concerns about continuing credit woes, a weakening dollar and
rising oil prices.

The Dow Jones industrial average was down 159.41, or 1.20
percent, at 13.106.88 in the opening minutes of trading.
