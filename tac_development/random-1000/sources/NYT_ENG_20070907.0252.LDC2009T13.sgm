BATON ROUGE, La.
</P>
<P>
Fans who are in town Saturday for Louisiana State's home opener
against Virginia Tech can get a glimpse of LSU's latest recruits
-- football players and a tiger mascot.
</P>
<P>
Mike VI, a 2-year old Bengal-Siberian tiger who is expected to
grow to 700 pounds, was acquired in August from an animal-rescue
center in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The tiger was placed on view on Sept. 1 in a $2.9 million, 15,000
-square-foot campus habitat equipped with a wading pool, a
waterfall, scratching posts, air-conditioned sleeping quarters
and around-the-clock care from the LSU School of Veterinary
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"He probably gets better medical treatment than most of us," Sean
O'Keefe, LSU's chancellor, said. "He's one charmed cat."
</P>
<P>
That is a widely held view here, where football and a live tiger
are seen as essential to the character of the state's flagship
university. But not everyone agrees. The university and the state
are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal-
rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as
live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of
sporting equipment. Perhaps never before have animals been so
prominent on the sports landscape.
</P>
<P>
When LSU's previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age
17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger. PETA
argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not
square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums
filled with tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban
cockfighting. In July, the California Supreme Court effectively
prohibited the sale of soccer shoes made from kangaroo hides. And
the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with
synthetic materials for its basketballs.
</P>
<P>
Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been
acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief
after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and
the national outrage aimed at the NFL quarterback Michael Vick
after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.
</P>
<P>
"These are manifestations of increasing concern about well-being
and the ethic that if you are going to use animals, there should
be a compelling reason," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive
of the Humane Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Referring to cockfighting and dogfighting, he said: "The idea
that cruelty to animals is wrong has become a bedrock principle
in American culture."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five or 30 years ago, the news media and law enforcement
officials might have looked the other way at an athlete involved
in dogfighting, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor of sports
sociology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off
and given him chance to cover up his tracks," Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Jackie Sherrill, then the football coach at Mississippi
State, got off with an apology and a warning after he had a bull
castrated to motivate his players for a game against Texas, whose
mascot is a longhorn steer named Bevo.
</P>
<P>
Public attitudes appear to have changed since then. Louisiana
state Sen. Arthur J. Lentini of Metairie, a New Orleans suburb,
led the effort in Louisiana to ban cockfighting, in which
roosters are fitted with spikes for slashing duels. Some
Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun
tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of
this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this
activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering
of human beings." The ban takes effect in August 2008.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer
shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a
campaign by animal-rights groups. In July, the California Supreme
Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Response to the court decision has been mixed. While animal-
rights groups celebrated, officials in Australia protested,
saying that kangaroos are no longer endangered and need to be
culled for proper conservation. A bill that would permit products
made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should not be intimidated by the scare tactics of
extremists who have a long-term agenda of banning the use of non-
endangered animal products," Warren Truss, Australia's trade
minister, said in a statement after the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more
nuanced way. Vick, who has been suspended by the NFL and faces a
possible prison sentence, has been widely criticized. Yet some
observers say that Vick has been subjected to greater outrage and
punishment than players who have committed violence against
people in shootings, incidents of domestic violence or fatal
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The LSU case represents perhaps PETA's most visible attempt to
dissuade universities from using live mascots. LSU has kept live
tigers since 1936. About three dozen schools keep live mascots.
Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too
costly for appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in
Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an
arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans. The arrangement
ended in 1972 when the university, which lacks a veterinary
school on campus, realized it could not provide suitable care,
Christina Chapple, a Southeastern spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was excited, then the reality of keeping a live animal
on campus set in," Chapple said. "We weren't set up to handle
that."
</P>
<P>
When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the
school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in
captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in
natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting,
establishing territory and choosing mates. Most universities and
all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live
animals, as mascots, PETA said.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping wild animals in captivity is cruel," Lisa Wathne, a PETA
captive exotic animal specialist, said in an interview. "As
grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate
for a tiger. The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting
event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
</P>
<P>
Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the
conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear
mascots. In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded
habitat. That same year, the University of South Carolina ignored
PETA's request that it stop using Gamecocks as a nickname, given
that cockfighting is illegal in the state.
</P>
<P>
Cockfighting is "certainly not condoned by the university," Russ
McKinney, a South Carolina spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock,
which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's
resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
In LSU's written response to PETA, O'Keefe, the chancellor, said
that instead of being cruel and inhumane, the school's habitat
was "far better" than most found in zoos. (At the Indiana rescue
facility, Mike VI shared with four other tigers a 20-foot-by
</P>
<P>
foot outdoor concrete enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G.
Baker, the LSU veterinarian who is the tiger's caretaker, said in
an interview.)
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to
preserve the exotic cats "will need to be conducted in
captivity." The campus enclosure will allow Mike VI to roam,
O'Keefe said, while keeping the animal safe from injury, poachers
and infection. LSU also plans to build an education center to
inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least LSU's
initial two home games, Baker said. First, it will attend soccer
games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds.
When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated
or forced into its trailer, Baker said. And no one will be
allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt
to make it roar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the
stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled
the field. The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
Referring to PETA officials, Baker said, "According to them,
humans don't have the moral authority to eat, own, exhibit or
experiment upon animals. I don't share that religion."
