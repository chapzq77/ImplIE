Syrian authorities release human rights activist after a four-day

DAMASCUS, Syria 2008-01-06 12:01:29 UTC

<P>
Syrian authorities have released a rights activist connected to a
well-known pro-democracy group after a four-day detention, a
local human rights organization said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush recently criticized Syria for
detaining members of the so-called "Damascus Declaration" group,
including Rashed Sattouf, and called for their release.
</P>
<P>
Authorities released Sattouf on Saturday, four days after he was
arrested in the northern city of Raqqa, the National Organization
for Human Rights in Syria said in a statement e-mailed to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Syria cracked down on the Damascus Declaration group, arresting
nine members, after it held a December meeting that brought
together opposition groups and activists calling for democratic
reform. Sattouf did not attend the December meeting, according to
the rights group, and his release reduced the number being held
to eight.
</P>
<P>
The "Damascus Declaration" was signed in 2005 by about 500 Syrian
and Lebanese intellectuals who urged the Syrian government to
improve ties with neighboring Lebanon, a sensitive issue in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials, who usually do not comment on domestic security
matters, have not commented on the recent arrests.
</P>
<P>
During a brief period after taking office in 2000, President
Bashar Assad released hundreds of political prisoners -- a move
seen at the time as an opening up of Syrian society. But he has
subsequently clamped down on pro-democracy activists, showing
there are limits to the dissent he is willing to tolerate.
