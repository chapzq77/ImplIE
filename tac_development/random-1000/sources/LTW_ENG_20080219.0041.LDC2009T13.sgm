New Mortgage Rule Aims to Close an Interest Rate Gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in
touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance
the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
</P>
<P>
"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I
know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37,
a legal secretary. "I'm just waiting and watching for any sign
that the interest rates will drop."
</P>
<P>
That drop may be coming soon.
</P>
<P>
The economic stimulus package that President Bush signed last
week includes provisions aimed at pulling those rates down and
reinvigorating a part of the mortgage market still stunned by
problems with subprime borrowers that surfaced last year.
</P>
<P>
Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as
the credit crisis worsened. Rattled investors stopped buying
them. Lenders responded by raising rates. And plenty of people in
high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing
market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into
cheaper loans.
</P>
<P>
As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up
to $729,750 for single-family homes. That's up from the previous
$417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price
nationwide. The amount would vary so that the most expensive
areas would qualify for bigger loans. The stimulus package also
increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will
grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The
two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors
treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit
guarantee. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the
only ones investors are buying these days, which is why
policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage
lenders to lower jumbo rates. But they disagree on how low and on
whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the
housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps
will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The most we can say right now is that there will be some
opportunity for some borrowers to achieve perhaps some interest-
rate relief on their jumbo mortgages," said Keith Gumbinger, a
vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey-based mortgage
research firm.
</P>
<P>
A lot of the details have not yet been determined. Under the new
plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to
125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan
statistical area. Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop
below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of
calculating the limits; it's expected to tell lenders next month
what the limits are in various areas. It will take several more
weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the
loans; first they must sort through internal logistical and
operational issues.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan
areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts. Federal
regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit
to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of
the region they will use.
</P>
<P>
But the Stanford Group Company, a policy research firm in
Washington, estimated that if the cap is based on median prices
compiled by the National Association of Realtors, locally it
would be about $500,000 and would apply to an area that extends
into West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"While not every American is going to get to enjoy a higher loan
limit, what makes this program exciting is that those who need
the assistance the most are going to get it," said Jaret Seiberg,
an analyst at Stanford Group. "There are markets where the
average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need
any kind of boost."
</P>
<P>
Lower rates would help Galloway, the Charles County homeowner.
She owes about $448,000 on her house. She has an adjustable-rate
mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly
to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates
started climbing and never stopped. In the past, lenders charged
about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo
loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac standards. But the spread has widened since
August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH
Associates.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent,
while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors
have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how
they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more
traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
</P>
<P>
Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from
lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
If investors feel that the larger loans inject too much risk into
the pool of mortgages offered to them, they will demand a higher
yield, which translates to higher rates for borrowers, said Ajay
Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income strategy at Barclays
Capital.
</P>
<P>
The perceived risk is not a creditworthiness issue, Rajadhyaksha
said. Rather, it's the jumbo borrowers' well-documented fondness
for refinancing when rates drop, which forces investors to
reinvest the money at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they
come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said. He
said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming
loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing
Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from
about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75. "That can be a pretty
big number because we're talking about markets with expensive
homes."
</P>
<P>
For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a
$500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said
Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
</P>
<P>
But even if rates drop, not everyone will be able to take
advantage of them, Retsinas said. Potential borrowers with less-
than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan
these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than
their homes are worth.
