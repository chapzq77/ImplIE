Time's Fast Approaching When Rockers Won't No More Be Rollin'

Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed
concert.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, I went to the exquisite Waterbury Palace Theater.
Pulsating strobe lights reflected Reed's disposition. Back then,
it felt like a teenage thing, going to Reed, Bowie and Queen
concerts. Three decades later, it's all changed.
</P>
<P>
Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage
thing in the '70s. I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the
rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll
concert. Now, the music's almost over. Rock concerts might
squeeze out another decade, but in the scope of things, that's
nearing the end.
</P>
<P>
I've been there, from the smoke-filled general admission arenas
where armband-wearing employees led the too-stoned to a backroom
cot, to today's reserved seating shows where one flash of a
digital camera gets you scolded by security. From bowling alley
music halls to stadiums of 40,000. From Bic lighter encores to
open cell-phone salutes. From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
</P>
<P>
It's all been part of a living museum. Rock concerts are an
invaluable art form. They're exhibitions of the masters, music as
their medium, the stage their easel. If I could collect them like
paintings, I would. The closest I come to collecting is buying
tickets; the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands
I saw 30 years ago. Steve Miller, the Rolling Stones, the Beach
Boys and, recently, my four tickets for Lou Reed.
</P>
<P>
Though the music still rocks, perhaps even more than in the past,
the musicians have become pensive with decades of life behind
them. Lou Reed -- appearing at the Calvin Theatre in
Northhampton, Mass. -- sang of the guardian angel who saved him
rather than of the white heat that once ran through his veins. At
the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach this summer, Stevie Nicks' first
words were "Through good grace, you're here. When we get older,
we learn to appreciate what we have more." Steve Miller closed
his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other." Most
of them call for peace.
</P>
<P>
So, there is a sadness to the concerts this time around. Time is
no longer on their side. Each tour now may be that band's last.
</P>
<P>
It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly
done, approaching historical status. My 18-year-old daughter
discovered the recent Lou Reed concert in a local arts newspaper
and insisted that we attend. Last summer, we missed an outdoor
concert by Don McLean, missed hearing "American Pie" live,
beneath the stars. To this day, we're sorry. What if we never get
another chance? So my daughter's logic, rightly so, was that
someday Mr. Reed won't be around to perform. We both know that
day will be sooner now, rather than later. Thirty years of his
concerts no longer unfurl before us. The clock is ticking, not
only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
</P>
<P>
So we buy tickets to beat that clock. Our summer lined up with
bands that may never tour again. Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
Stevie Nicks. Lou Reed. Steve Miller. Ringo Starr and his All
Starr Band. Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love,
reached our ears. My children heard a Beatle sing.
</P>
<P>
Their children will not. Their children will never see Mr. Reed,
alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking
transformation. They will not watch Mike Love consider if
everybody had an ocean, surfboards set on the stage, Mr. Love
giving the peace sign. They will never see Mick Jagger insist he
likes it, this thing called rock 'n' roll, as he struts past
Keith Richards on a seven-story stage. Liza Minnelli will never
invite their children to "Come, hear the music play."
</P>
<P>
We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring
three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
This millennium's music has no Billy Joel defining the king and
queen of the prom. Has no young Steven Tyler whose train will
still be rolling in 30 years. Has no John Fogerty penning
scathing lyrics against the war. Has no Freddie Mercury rocking
out stadium anthems. No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
No Beatle.
</P>
<P>
Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music. Every concert
now is a gift. Every concert takes another little piece of my
heart with the final encore. The imminence is palpable, of the
exhibit closing, of the stage lights going dark.
