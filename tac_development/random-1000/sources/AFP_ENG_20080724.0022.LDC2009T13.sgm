Utah mine operators fined 1.6 mln dlrs for deadly collapse

<P>
The operators of a Utah mine at the center of a collapse that led
to nine fatalities in August last year have been fined 1.6
million dollars, health and safety officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said the
operators of the Crandall Canyon Mine had failed to report
repeated collapses at the facility which meant inspectors were
unable to assess practices at the facility.
</P>
<P>
Six miners were killed on August 6 when pillars propping up
tunnels some 1,500 feet (450 meters) underground collapsed. Three
rescue workers were killed 10 days later after a tunnel they were
working in collapsed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Richard Stickler, assistant secretary of labor
for the MSHA, said the tragedy had stemmed from mine operator
Genwal Resource's "reckless failure" to report three previous
coal "outbursts", including one just three days before the
initial incident on August 6.
</P>
<P>
"These reporting failures were critical, because they deprived
MSHA of the information it needed to properly assess the
operator's mining plans," Stickler said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"MSHA also found that the operator was taking more coal than
allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor. This dangerously
weakened the strength of the roof support."
</P>
<P>
The MSHA said Genwal had been fined 1.34 million dollars for
violations that directly contributed to the deaths six miners.
</P>
<P>
The mine operators were also hit with fines totaling 296,664
dollars for 11 non- contributory violations arising from the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
A mining consultant, Agapito Associates, was fined 220,000
dollars for faulty analysis of the mine's design, the MSHA
statement said.
