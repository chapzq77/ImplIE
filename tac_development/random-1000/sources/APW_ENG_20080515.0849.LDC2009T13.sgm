Judge says no to sister of Spanish princess seeking restraining
order against media outlets

MADRID, Spain 2008-05-15 15:12:18 UTC

<P>
The sister of Spanish Crown Princess Letizia, it seems, is a
celebrity whether she likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
A judge rejected a request from Telma Ortiz for a restraining
order barring media outlets from filming her, arguing Thursday
that she is a public figure despite her wishes.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, 35, had argued she was not a celebrity and said news
organizations have been harassing her and her companion, Enrique
Martin Llop.
</P>
<P>
This week she sued about 50 news outlets in a case being heard in
the central city of Toledo. The media organizations included
major TV channels and gossip magazines like Hola!
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday Judge Maria Lourdes Perez Padilla said a
restraining order would be "legally unviable" because Ortiz and
Martin Llop are in the limelight, even if they claim otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered them to pay undisclosed court costs.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz's problems with the Spanish gossip media began early this
year when she returned from the Philippines, where she had been
employed as an aid worker, to have a baby in Spain with Martin
Llop.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said the media have invaded their privacy repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
In previous cases, Spanish celebrities have tented to sue a
particular news outlet over publication of a specific photo or
piece of footage.
</P>
<P>
But in this case, Ortiz sought a blanket ban on news
organizations publishing photos or footage of her, except ones in
which she appears at official functions in her role as sister of
the crown princess. Such appearances are rare.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz is the middle sister of three. Letizia is the eldest. The
youngest, Erika, died in February 2007 in what was widely
believed to have been a suicide.
