UN envoy seeks talks between Myanmar military, pro-democracy
opponents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, Myanmar 2007-11-04 05:18:46 UTC
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari was in Myanmar's bunker-like new
capital Sunday hoping to nudge the country's ruling generals into
reconciliation talks with their pro-democracy opponents.
</P>
<P>
Gambari arrived Saturday for his second visit since the junta
violently suppressed anti-government demonstrations in September.
The day before his arrival in Yangon, the isolated Southeast
Asian nation's largest city, the junta announced it planned to
expel the top U.N. diplomat in the country, adding an extra
hurdle to the envoy's already difficult mission.
</P>
<P>
After a brief stopover in Yangon, Gambari flew to Naypyitaw to
meet with senior leaders, Myanmar government officials said,
requesting anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to
the media.
</P>
<P>
It was not known which leaders would meet him in Naypyitaw, 250
miles (400 kilometers) north of Yangon, where the generals have
established a new capital in a remote area nestled in mountain
jungles, or whether he would later be allowed to visit detained
democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Expected to be high on Gambari's agenda is the junta's accusation
that U.N. resident coordinator Charles Petrie went beyond his
duties by criticizing the generals' failure to meet the economic
and humanitarian needs of its people, and by saying this was the
cause of September's mass pro-democracy protests.
</P>
<P>
The military has said 10 people were killed in the crackdown, but
diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is much higher.
Thousands of people were detained.
</P>
<P>
The junta gave foreign diplomats and U.N. representatives a note
saying the government did not intend to continue Petrie's
assignment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said in a statement that Gambari met with Petrie after
his arrival and would "stay in Myanmar as long as necessary to
accomplish his mission." Gambari carried a message of support for
Petrie from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as well as one to
junta head Senior Gen. Than Shwe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Gambari was earlier dispatched to Myanmar after the government
crackdown, meeting with Than Shwe as well as twice with Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
But little of substance has changed on Myanmar's political scene
since, and analysts expect that little will result from Gambari's
current visit.
</P>
<P>
"It's a game. It's the only game in town, but it's a game," said
David Steinberg, a Myanmar expert from Georgetown University who
visited the country last month and met with ministerial-level
officials.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has attempted to bring about reconciliation
for almost two decades. The junta has from time to time made
minor concessions, such as brief meetings with Suu Kyi, but
continues to perpetuate its 45-year stranglehold on power -- and
sometimes snub its nose at the international community.
</P>
<P>
Protest leaders who recently escaped to Thailand say some still
look on the United Nations with hope, but others are deeply
disillusioned that it has failed to be more forceful in dealing
with the generals.
</P>
<P>
"The world seems to have accepted the lies of the (junta). This
is a matter of life or death but so far the U.N. and the world
have only come up with words," said Kar Kar Pancha, a Yangon
businessman who fled to the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general, who met Gambari on Friday morning in
Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss his Myanmar trip, was "disappointed"
at the government's note, and expressed "full confidence in the
United Nations country team and its leadership," U.N. spokeswoman
Michele Montas said at U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.N. envoy will convey to Myanmar's rulers the
secretary-general's "very strong" support for the U.N. leadership
in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
Gambari has been on a six-nation Asian tour urging support from
key countries for national reconciliation, a stepped-up
transition to democracy, and the release of all detained
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other Western countries shun the junta for its poor
human rights record and failure to hand over power to Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Suu Kyi's party after it won national elections in
1990. They maintain diplomatic and economic sanctions against the
regime, and block assistance from multilateral aid agencies such
as the World Bank.
