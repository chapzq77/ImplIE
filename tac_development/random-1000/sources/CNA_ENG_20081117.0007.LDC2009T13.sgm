China Medical University Hospital in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung celebrated its 28th anniversary Sunday with a meeting
with seven visiting American cancer experts.

At the invitation of hospital chairman Tsai Chang-hai, Karen
Fields, vice president of the Global Academic Programs at the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the six other
experts attended the meeting to share views with their Taiwanese
counterparts on issues related to treating cancer.

Tsai said that the M.D. Anderson Cancer in Houston, ranked as the
top U.S. facility for cancer care, forged sisterhood ties with
the Taiwan hospital in June in an effort to introduce advanced
technology for cancer diagnosis and treatment to Taiwan through
the hospital.

Cancer has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan since 1982,
with the number of people dying of cancer breaking the 40,000
mark last year for the first time, according to Tsai.

He said that reducing the threat of cancer has become the shared
responsibility of the medical sector.

Tsai also said the central Taiwan hospital set up a cancer center
equipped with state-of-the-art equipment during its anniversary
last year and is working hard to integrate medical resources in
treating cancer.

Noting that the agreement reached in June by the two institutions
was aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation in cancer
prevention and treatment and enhancing academic and teaching
exchanges, Tsai said that the two institutions also agreed to
hold two meetings per year between experts from both sides, with
the first meeting set on Sunday to celebrate the university's
anniversary.

At the meeting, Fields delivered a keynote speech on how to
promote prevention and treatment  of cancer via international
cooperation.

In the initial stage, the two sides will focus their cooperative
efforts on the development of the new technologies for treatment
of oral cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer and
esophagal cancer, according to the hospital.
