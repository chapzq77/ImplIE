Unprecedented trial against feared religious police opens in
Saudi Arabia

<P>
Four men, including three members of Saudi Arabia's religious
police, went on trial Sunday for their alleged involvement in the
death of a man in detention -- an unprecedented case against a
powerful force long resented for intimidating people.
</P>
<P>
The religious police enforce the kingdom's strict Islamic
lifestyle, patrolling public places to ensure women are covered,
the sexes don't mingle, shops close five times a day for Muslim
prayers and men go to the mosque and worship.
</P>
<P>
The man's family is demanding the death penalty for those found
guilty of the death their relative, Ahmed al-Bulaiwi, a retired
border patrol guard in his early 50s. Al-Bulaiwi died in custody
shortly after his June 1 arrest for being alone with a woman who
was not a relative -- an act considered an offense in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Audah al-Bulaiwi, who is representing the family in court, said
three judges presided over the first hearing in the case in the
northern city of Tabuk. He said the defendants -- three members
of the religious police and a fourth believed to be from the
regular police -- were present in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding execution for those found guilty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam under which
those convicted of murder, drug trafficking, rape and armed
robbery are executed in public with a sword.
</P>
<P>
A new hearing has been set for Tuesday, said Audah al-Bulaiwi.
The trial was supposed to begin on June 23, but a judge postponed
it to Sunday because the documents the al-Bulaiwi family had
presented were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bulaiwi's death -- and the case of a second man who died in
custody -- are a setback for the Commission for the Propagation
of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which employs the religious
police. The cases have provoked a wave of condemnation and calls
for the regulation of this independent body.
</P>
<P>
In the al-Bulaiwi case, commission members arrested the man after
they observed the woman, believed to be in her 50s, getting into
his car near an amusement park, according to accounts published
by the local media. Under the kingdom's rules, a woman cannot
drive, and can only go out in public with her father, brother,
son or husband.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that al-Bulaiwi, who supplemented his
pension by working as a driver, was asked by the family of the
woman to drive her home, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
An official medical report cleared the commission members, saying
al-Bulaiwi died of natural causes. The defendants are being tried
under the private rights of crime victims or their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Another commission member has been arrested in the case of
Sulaiman al-Huraisi, who died last month while in custody of the
religious police. The force had raided his house in Riyadh
because they suspected he had alcohol -- illegal in Saudi Arabia.
It was not clear whether he would stand trial.
</P>
<P>
In a third case, a Saudi woman has filed a lawsuit against the
commission, claiming she was mistreated by two commission members
in 2003 because she was not dressed conservatively. A hearing is
set for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Many Saudis say they support the idea of having the commission
because its mandate is based on several verses in the Quran. But
they also say it should be regulated because the free rein it has
long enjoyed has led to some of its members overstepping their
duties.
