Clintons Report Earning $109 Million Since 2000

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to
the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax
returns released by the campaign late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Former President Clinton has collected a whopping $51.9 million
in appearance fees since leaving office in Jan. 2001 -- averaging
about $150,000 per speech. He's also raked in $29.6 million from
his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned
tepid reviews.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after
running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so
strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the
$1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999. The
documents released Friday illustrate a remarkable financial
turnaround, thanks to speaking fees, lucrative book contracts and
deals with a pair of businessmen who have paid more than $15
million to the former president.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who released his tax returns months
ago, has often taunted Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for
refusing to release hers earlier, suggesting she wasn't committed
to transparency.
</P>
<P>
There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited
filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one-
page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an
extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the
past three years).
</P>
<P>
But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including
investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the
former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is
counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar
voters.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's
income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her
2002 autobiography "Living History." In January she loaned her
campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the
family till, saying she had used "my money."
</P>
<P>
The Clintons gave more than $10 million, or about 9.5 percent of
their gross income, to charity, the records show, paying more
than $33.8 million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but
they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with
a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to
various accounts. John Kerry is the richest senator with a net
worth estimated at $211 million.
</P>
<P>
Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about
$3.9 million from 2000 to 2007. But they gave less to charity
than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that
period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent. The couple donated an
additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than
taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a
swipe at Obama.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the
couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.
Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more
loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no
evidence they were ever repaid. Uncollected interest estimates
required by the Internal Revenue Service indicate the loans were
substantial, possibly in excess of $100,000, according to
accountants.
</P>
<P>
"The Clintons made interest-free loans to some of their family
members," said Carson. "The loans ... are personal; The Clintons
are going to respect their family members' privacy."
</P>
<P>
The returns shed greater light on Bill Clinton's close
relationship with billionaire California businessman Ron Burkle,
a family friend who has paid him about $15 million since 2002 as
an adviser and rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
Less clear is the link between the former president and Indian-
American businessman Vinod Gupta, the founder of database vendor
InfoUSA, which has been accused of offering call lists to
predatory telemarketers. The tax returns show Gupta's company
paid Clinton $800,000 in the last two years, far less than the
$3.3 million in payments Clinton was said to have received in an
investor lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Carson did not return a request for a comment about Gupta.
