POZNAN, Poland, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's far-reaching tree
planting efforts in recent years have benefited its environment
and economy significantly and should be recognized as one of the
key tools to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the chairman
of the non-governmental organization World Growth said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"China's afforestation efforts have demonstrated that forestry
expansion will effectively reduce global emissions and promote
economic growth," Alan Oxley, also former chairman of the GATT
Council, said in a written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"China should be commended, and an expanded sustainable forestry
will both offset carbon emissions and produce development
dividends," said Oxley, adding that China's efforts have largely
been ignored at the climate talks in Poznan.
</P>
<P>
According to a new report by World Growth, China pledged in 2006
to expand the country's forest area to 20 percent of total land
by 2010, which would increase the size of China's total carbon
sink by 50 million tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly enough to
offset the emissions of the entire country of Sweden for a whole
year.
</P>
<P>
China's approach to climate change is fully consistent with the
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which encourages
attention to climate change adaptation.
</P>
<P>
China is seeking to improve energy efficiency to reduce emission
rates  and it is also expanding its forest sinks, which are
tangible measures to reduce emission rates, Oxley said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, given the need for China to continue to raise
living standards and develop the economy, an overall increase in
emissions for some time is yet inevitable," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is understandable, China has also indicated that a key aim
is to adapt to the impacts of climate change.".
</P>
<P>
The UN technical advisor on climate change, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated that expansion of
sustainable forestry is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce
emissions. Yet it is still being ignored by negotiators in
industrialized economies.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ongoing Poznan climate talks, Oxley said a long-
term strategy to reduce emissions should first give developing
countries time to raise living standards.
