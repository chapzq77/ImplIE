Close to 100 armed Palestinians from the moderate Fatah group of
President Mahmoud Abbas crossed into Egypt from the Gaza Strip
Thursday fleeing Hamas's military campaign, police said.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah members, carrying AK-47 rifles, were received on the
Egyptian side of the border in the town of Rafah by officials who
had coordinated with the fighters prior to their arrival, said
Capt. Mohammed Badr, a police officer in the northern Sinai
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Badr said the men would stay at a camp in Rafah used by the
Egyptian central security forces.
</P>
<P>
The militant Hamas group has been attempting a complete takeover
of Gaza, and its fighters have captured several of the most
important security compounds in the area. Scores of people, most
of them militants, have been killed since Sunday in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Palestinians jammed on the Egyptian side of the
Rafah border crossing Thursday, including women and children,
crying and begging for the Egyptian authorities to let them enter
Gaza. But they were not allowed to cross.
