OTE, Greece's largest telecom company, said Thursday its net
profit increased 16.6 percent in the second quarter, mainly due
to an increase in mobile revenues.
</P>
<P>
Net profit reached euro159.3 million (US$235.2 million) during
that period, compared to euro136.6 million (US$201.7 million) in
the second quarter of 2007.
</P>
<P>
Revenues were euro1.59 billion (US$2.35 billion) during that
time, compared to euro1.55 billion (US$2.29 billion) in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Total fixed-line revenues were euro646.8 million ($955.1 million)
in the second quarter, down 2.7 percent from that period in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Mobile revenues were euro794.2 million (US$1.17 billion), up 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our mobile operations achieved dynamic growth and market share
gains in all countries," said OTE Chairman and CEO Panagis
Vourloumis.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Greek government and Deutsche Telekom AG struck a
deal on sharing OTE ownership and management control.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which Greece's parliament ratified in June,
the government and Deutsche Telekom will each control 25 percent
plus one share of OTE.
