INSURERS CITED AS CAUSE OF CLOGGED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY
SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending
millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for
disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle-
blowers.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies are the source of the problem, the lawsuits
say. The insurers are forcing many people who file disability
claims with them to also apply to Social Security -- even people
who clearly do not qualify for the government program.
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more
stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of
the applications, at least initially. Often, the insurers then
tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the
cost.
</P>
<P>
The insurers say that requiring a Social Security assessment is a
standard practice and that there is nothing wrong with it. The
policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit
payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice. Thus, if
a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else -- like
workers' compensation, a disability pension or Social Security --
the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that
amount.
</P>
<P>
The flood of referrals, however, is making it hard for Social
Security to respond to people who are truly disabled, said
Kenneth D. Nibali, the former top administrator of the Social
Security disability program. "Anybody who is forced to come into
this system, and who doesn't need to be there, is affecting
someone else," said Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as
an expert witness for the plaintiffs. "They're holding up cases
for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in
many cases are much worse off."
</P>
<P>
Already, the disability program is in much worse shape
financially than the old-age portion of Social Security. It is
projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old-
age trust fund.
</P>
<P>
The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work
force ages, since recovery time increases with age. The number of
people waiting for hearings on their claims by an administrative
law judge has more than doubled since 2000, and the average wait
has grown to 512 days in that time, from 258 days.
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration is not an active participant
in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them.
