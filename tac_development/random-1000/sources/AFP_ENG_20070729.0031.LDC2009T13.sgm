Tennis: Sharapova makes San Diego title defence return
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending champion Maria Sharapova makes her first appearance
since Wimbledon at the San Diego Classic this week as she once
again tests her long-standing shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
The world number two, who beat Kim Clijsters in the 2006 final to
capture the hardcourt title here, has been dogged by the injury
problem since the spring.
</P>
<P>
But a pain-killing injection has helped her to the French Open
semi-finals and a Wimbledon fourth-round loss to Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
Following the wet fortnight at the All England Club, the 20-year-
old Russian underwent a precautionary scan and controversially
pulled out of Russia's Fed Cup semi-final win over the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Despite failing to win a trophy so far this season, and with her
US Open title defence approaching, Sharapova is unworried.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 20 years old, I've won two Grand Slams. I've been number one
in the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I've got plenty more years to either win matches or find
confidence."
</P>
<P>
Serb Jelena Jankovic, who won a surprise Wimbledon mixed doubles
title with Jamie Murray, has played just one Fed Cup rubber
indoors since the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
She will get back on cement for the first time since March in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
Along with the other eight leading seeds, she has a first-round
bye at what will be the last edition of an event which has fallen
victim to the WTA calendar shake-up.
</P>
<P>
Russians hold half of the top eight seedings, with Anna
Chakvetadze at three, Nadia Petrova fourth and Dinara Safina
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli of France will try to put
behind last week's opening-match disappointment at Stanford when
she lost to Lilia Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchwoman has admitted to still being tired and overwhelmed
by her surprise Grand Slam performance this month.
</P>
<P>
Slovak Daniela Hantuchova takes the sixth seeding with Martina
Hingis at seven and playing for the first time since a back
injury which hampered her Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon champion Venus Williams, who will represent her family
after sister Serena withdrew with her thumb injury, last played
the event in 2002 when she lifted the title with a win over
Jelena Dokic.
