Iran warns about attack amid mixed signals on nuclear crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher
oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled
possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the
West.
</P>
<P>
"Iran, if there were any kind of activity of any sort, is not
going to be quiet and would react fiercely," Iranian Oil Minister
Gholam Hossein Nozari said here when asked what Tehran would do
in the event of an attack.
</P>
<P>
He added that oil prices, which have been driven to record levels
partly because of fear about the loss of Iran's 4.0-million-
barrel-a-day output,   would rise sharply if Israel or the United
States launched a military strike.
</P>
<P>
His comments on the sidelines of an oil conference here came as
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking to US media, said
that a "new process" was underway in the dispute about the
country's nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
The encouragement was greeted with scepticism by Washington but
more positively in Brussels where EU foreign policy chief Javier
Solana described as "interesting."
</P>
<P>
Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at
ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange
for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears
could be used to make an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing
effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting
up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
"A process is underway and it started with the package delivered
by Iran," Mottaki said in an interview with US media in New York,
according to the state- run IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
"This package tackled important questions and then on the other
side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a surge in speculation recently that Israel might
be planning a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites after
it emerged that Israel had carried out practice runs.
</P>
<P>
But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that
Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be
prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei said on Tuesday it would be in Iran's interest to accept
the package and warned against provocative remarks that could
destabilise the situation.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Wednesday that it was sceptical about
Mottaki's comments and President George W. Bush again stressed
that military action was possible despite his preference for
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"I have always said that all options are on the table but the
first option for the United States is to solve this problem
diplomatically," Bush told reporters in the White House Rose
Garden.
</P>
<P>
Top US military chiefs said Wednesday that opening up a third
front against Iran in addition to Iraq and Afghanistan would be
"extremely stressful."
</P>
<P>
No Iranian official has suggested in the past months that Tehran
is ready to give any ground on the key question of enrichment,
which Iran must suspend in order to enter the talks offered by
the world powers.
</P>
<P>
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had repeatedly vowed that Iran will
never suspend enrichment and Khamenei himself has said many times
over the past years that Tehran will not back down in the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful and it needs
nuclear energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will
eventually run out.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its regional ally Israel have never ruled
out military strikes to end what they see as Tehran's defiance.
</P>
<P>
After warning of Iran's response to any aggression, Oil Minister
Nozari stressed that the country, the fourth-biggest oil producer
in the world, was a "reliable source of supply to the market and
Iran remains a supplier forever."
</P>
<P>
Analysts fear that Iran would cease crude exports and could block
key Gulf oil shipping routes if attacked.
</P>
<P>
"When just a statement (about a possible attack) makes this much
volatility in the market, can you imagine that if any action
happens ... what would be the result in the oil market?" he said
through an interpreter at an industry event here.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark oil prices traded at about 141 dollars per barrel in
London and New York on Wednesday after striking a record above
143 dollars last week
</P>
<P>
The comments, made at the World Petroleum Congress industry
event, followed signs of growing tension between crude producing
and consuming countries over who is to blame for record crude
prices.
