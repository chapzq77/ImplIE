Kenya turns to China, domestic market to rebuild tourism
</HEADLINE>

Kenya's tourism will turn to China and seek to develop its
domestic market to inject new life in a sector battered by recent
post-election violence, tourism officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"China is an important market, a new market and a growing one,"
said Rebecca Nabutola, permanent secretary at the ministry of
tourism and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
More than 18,700 Chinese tourists visited the East African nation
in 2007, up 27 percent from the number of arrivals recorded in
2006, she said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
While flights from Kenya's traditional tourism markets -- notably
in Europe -- were halted or reduced following the eruption of
post-election strife in late December, China did not issue travel
advisories.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to China in an attempt to rebuild our image...
it was never really dented and tourist behaviour was not really
affected," said Nabutola, part of a delegation heading to China
next week to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the top foreign currency earning sector in Kenya and
suffered from the worldwide attention attracted by the electoral
dispute and ensuing cycle of tribal violence and revenge
killings.
</P>
<P>
With a fast-growing middle-class, China -- the world's most
populated country and its fourth largest economy -- is a coveted
market for all top tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
"There's also a lot of potential and a lot of interest that has
come from India," the ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
With cancellations from overseas tourists hitting around 90
percent in January, the ministry has launched a recovery
programme which will also involve the development of domestic
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"If we want a sustainable tourism sector, we need a solid
domestic base," Nabutola said. The domestic market currently
accounts for only 25 percent of the sector's revenue, a figure
she said Kenya hoped to double.
