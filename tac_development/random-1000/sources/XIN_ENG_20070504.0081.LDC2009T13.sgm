Beavers threatened by drought in NW China

URUMQI, May 4 (Xinhua)

<P>
The long drought in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region is threatening the survival of the country's tiny beaver
population, according to local forestry sources.
</P>
<P>
In northern Xinjiang's Altay area, low water levels have driven
the semi-aquatic rodents from the Ulungur River, their main
habitat in China, to look for new homes.
</P>
<P>
"We have received reports that beavers have died searching for
new habitats. Some are killed by dogs and some simply die from
thirst," said Han Baohong, director of the forestry bureau in
Fuhai County, on the lower reaches of the Ulungur River.
</P>
<P>
"After the snow has melted in May, the drought will make living
conditions even worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some beavers had started digging into the banks of irrigation
channels, posing a threat to local agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The population of beavers in China is about 500, even lower than
that of the giant panda. Beavers usually spend winter in nests
built in riverbanks where water levels exceed 1.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Altay region had seen little precipitation since last winter
and has recorded its driest spring since 1974. The water volume
of the Ulungur River is just 60 percent of level at the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
The forestry administration has called on residents to help
protect beavers. It has also assigned workers to track the
animals so they can help them survive.
