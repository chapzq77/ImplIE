Al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden called on the Europeans to stop
helping the United States in the war in Afghanistan, saying
America is "ebbing" in excerpts of a new audiotape aired Thursday
on Al-Jazeera television.

"The American tide is ebbing, so it is best for you to press your
leaders to change their policies," bin Laden said, addressing
Europeans and referring to their countries' military
contributions in Afghanistan.

Al-Jazeera aired two brief excerpts of a few seconds each of the
audiotape, which al-Qaida had announced several days ago that it
would release soon. It was the fourth message by the al-Qaida
leader this year.
