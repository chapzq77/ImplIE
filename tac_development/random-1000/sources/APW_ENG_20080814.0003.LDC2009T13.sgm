Russia defies Georgia cease-fire; US sends aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUTSIDE GORI, Georgia 2008-08-14 00:01:18 UTC
</P>
<P>
A Russian military convoy defied a cease-fire agreement and
rolled through a strategically important city in the former
Soviet republic of Georgia, which claimed fresh looting and
bombing by the Russians and their allies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush said a massive U.S. aid package was
on the way for tens of thousands uprooted in the conflict and
demanded that Russia "keep its word and act to end this crisis."
</P>
<P>
"The United States stands with the democratically elected
government of Georgia and insists that the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Georgia be respected," Bush said sternly
in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One day after the Kremlin and its smaller neighbor agreed to a
French-brokered cease-fire to end the dispute over two pro-
Russian breakaway territories, the pact appeared fragile at best.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of Russian trucks and
armored vehicles leaving the city of Gori, some 35 kilometers (20
miles) south of the separatist region of South Ossetia and home
of a key highway that divides Georgia in two, and moving deeper
into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers waved at journalists and one jokingly shouted, "Come
with us, beauty, we're going to Tbilisi." The convoy roared
southeast, toward the Georgian capital, but then turned north and
set up camp about an hour's drive away from it.
</P>
<P>
Georgian officials said the Russians had looted and bombed Gori
before they left. Moscow denied the accusation, but it appeared
to be on a technicality: A BBC reporter in Gori said Russian
tanks were in the streets while their South Ossetian allies
seized cars, looted homes and set houses on fire.
</P>
<P>
As confusion reigned on the first day of the cease-fire
agreement, Bush called a Rose Garden speech to express concern
about reports the Russians were already breaking it.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sending U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
first to France and then to Tbilisi to reinforce U.S. efforts to
"rally the world in defense of a free Georgia."
</P>
<P>
For her part, Rice said: "This is not 1968 and the invasion of
Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a neighbor, occupy a
capital, overthrow a government and get away with it. Things have
changed."
</P>
<P>
Bush said a huge U.S. aid effort was under way, including
American naval forces and C-17 military cargo planes, to get
clothes, blankets, medicine and other supplies to refugees. The
European Union agreed to consider deploying European peacekeeping
monitors to the area.
</P>
<P>
Besides the hundreds killed since hostilities broke out last
week, a United Nations agency estimates 100,000 Georgians may
have been uprooted. A spokesman said the U.N. refugee agency was
helping evacuate about 1,500 people fleeing the Kodori Gorge in
the breakaway province of Abkhazia alone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili conducted a blitz of
interviews with news outlets at home and abroad and made a series
of claims, some of which were disputed as inaccurate or
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
He said on national television that the U.S. arrival of a
military cargo plane with humanitarian aid "means that Georgia's
ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S.
Defense Department."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell stressed the United States had
no plans to take over Georgian airports or seaports to deliver
the aid. "We have no designs on taking control of any Georgian
facility."
</P>
<P>
In a sharp response to Bush's speech, Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov called Georgia's leadership "a special project of
the United States. And we understand that the United States is
worried about its project."
</P>
<P>
Russian news agencies quoted him saying the United States would
have to choose "support for a virtual project" or "real
partnership" on issues such as U.S.-Russian cooperation on Iran
and other world tension spots.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said his country's
military actions in Georgia were comparable to the U.S. response
to the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. "We just reacted because we
didn't have any other option. Any civilized country would act
same way. I may remind you, September the 11th, the reaction was
similar. American citizens were killed. You know the reaction,"
he said on BBC World News.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili criticized Western nations for failing to help
Georgia, a U.S. ally that has been seeking NATO membership. "In a
way," he said, "Russians are fighting a proxy war with the West
through us."
</P>
<P>
The conflict centers on South Ossetia and another region claimed
by Georgia that leans Russian, Abkhazia. When Georgia cracked
down on South Ossetia on Aug. 7, Russia sent its tanks and troops
into the two regions and deeper into Georgia proper.
</P>
<P>
Georgia, bordering the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia, was
ruled by Moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the 1991
breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia lies close to the heart of many Russians. Its coast was
a favorite vacation spot in Soviet times and the province is just
down the coast from Sochi, the Russian resort that will host the
2014 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Russia has distributed passports to most people in South Ossetia
and Abkhazia and stationed peacekeepers there since the early
1990s. Georgia wants the peacekeepers out, but Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev has insisted they stay.
</P>
<P>
In defiance, a few dozen Abkhazian fighters, some with assault
rifles and one with a dagger, planted their red, white and green
flag in Georgian territory across the Inguri River.
</P>
<P>
"This is Abkhazian land," one of them said. Another laughed that
Georgians retreating from Abkhazia had received "American
training in running away."
</P>
<P>
The peace plan apparently would allow Georgian forces to return
to the positions they held in South Ossetia and Abkhazia before
Aug. 7 and clearly requires Russia to leave all parts of Georgia
except South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Georgian Security Council chief Alexander Lomaia
said 50 Russian tanks entered Gori on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Russian units that later left to camp outside the
city were camouflaged with foliage.
</P>
<P>
The convoy was mainly support vehicles, including ambulances,
although there were a few heavy cannons. There were about 100
combat troops and another 100 medics, drivers and other support
personnel.
</P>
<P>
About 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the camp, about 80 well-
equipped Georgian soldiers were forming what appeared to be a new
front line, armed with pistols, shoulder-launched anti-tank
rockets and Kalashnikovs.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes continued in South Ossetia where Russians
responded to Georgian snipers.
</P>
<P>
In the Black Sea port of Poti, and Georgian television showed
boats ablaze in the harbor. Georgia's security chief said Russian
forces targeted three Georgian boats -- but Lavrov said Russian
troops were nowhere near the city.
</P>
<P>
For several days, Russian troops held the western town of Zugdidi
near Abkhazia, controlling the region's main highway. An AP
reporter saw a convoy of 13 Russian tanks and armored personnel
carriers in Zugdidi's outskirts Wednesday. Later in the day,
Georgian officials said the Russians pulled out of Zugdidi.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree Wednesday
saying that Russian navy ships deployed to the Georgian coast
will need authorization to return to the navy base Russia leases
from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The rights group Human Rights Watch said it has witnessed South
Ossetian fighters looting ethnic Georgians' houses and has
recorded multiple accounts of Georgian militias intimidating
ethnic Ossetians. The report was important independent
confirmation of the claims by each side in the Russia-Georgia
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Olympics in Beijing, Georgia and Russia clashed
in competition for the first time. Georgia rallied to beat Russia
in beach volleyball, two sets to one.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Georgia are actually friends. People are friends,"
said the Georgian beach volleyball team leader, Levan
Akhtulediani. "I say once again, its better to compete on the
field rather than outside the field.
