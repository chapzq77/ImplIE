The Fading of the Mirage Economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly, it seems, we're getting hit from all directions.
</P>
<P>
Energy and food prices are soaring. The housing market continues
to collapse. Government revenue is falling, and taxes are rising.
Airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service.
Banks are pulling credit lines. Auto companies are cutting
production once again. Even investment bankers are losing their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The tendency is to see these as separate developments, each with
its own causes and dynamic. Fundamentally, however, they are all
part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging
itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time
allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really
were.
</P>
<P>
Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit
created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of
land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and
persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to
support a lifestyle their income could not sustain. Now that the
bubble has burst, we are coming to accept the reality of lower
prices, reduced production, declining homeownership rates and the
wisdom that a house is not an ATM or a substitute for a
retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new
equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination
where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into
some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
</P>
<P>
But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real
estate. The same factors that were behind the housing bubble were
also at work, to varying degrees, in the auto bubble, the
commercial real estate bubble, the travel bubble, the college
tuition bubble, the retail bubble, the Web 2.0 bubble and most
recently the commodities bubble. Unlike housing, which began
losing steam two years ago, these other sectors have just begun
the painful process of repricing and finding a new balance
between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Take the case of the airline industry, which likes to blame its
woes on skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
While there's an ongoing debate about why the price of oil has
doubled over the past year, there is little doubt that the
declining dollar is a significant factor. The decline is the
result of years of large and growing U.S. trade deficits that
should have caused the exchange rate to adjust years ago but
didn't because so many of our trading partners in Asia and the
Middle East were intent on linking their currencies to the
dollar. In the process of maintaining those dollar pegs and
reinvesting those surpluses in Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac securities, they created a surfeit of cheap credit
that spawned all those bubbles.
</P>
<P>
Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar
is being repriced. But in the short run, it has played havoc with
the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
Producers have raised their dollar prices to prevent a decline in
the global purchasing power from their commodities sales. At the
same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and
corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation,
turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn
futures to jet fuel. At some point, that speculative bubble will
burst and energy prices will plunge. When things finally settle
down, the new equilibrium price is almost certain to be well
above where it was last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem. The
reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many
tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of
providing the service passengers want and expect. That includes
such things as cleaning planes; handling reservations, check-ins
and baggage without undue waiting; serving a decent meal when
necessary; and treating passengers fairly when flights are
canceled. But they also include costs that may be less obvious,
like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs,
paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern
air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the
true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
</P>
<P>
Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to
reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably
involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights,
fewer passengers and fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage
than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and
takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
</P>
<P>
What I've described is a double whammy for American households:
the slower growth that comes with downsizing a number of key
industries that expanded as a result of the credit bubble, along
with rising prices for a food, energy, health care and almost
everything imported. And you can add a third blow, this one from
government.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, state and local governments are already hip-
deep into budget crises in response to declining revenue from
property assessments and real estate transfers. Here in
Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits
and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal
operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and
economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as
the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has
roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble. Despite the
happy talk you might be hearing from the presidential candidates,
it presents Americans with a stark and unpleasant choice.
</P>
<P>
One option is to raise taxes and leave less money for private
spending, which is what many state and local governments have
begun to do. The other is to accept lower levels of government
service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of
some households while forcing others to go without services or
pay for them privately. Either way, it amounts to a lower
standard of living than we thought we had achieved.
</P>
<P>
Is all this the end of the world? For the richest country on the
planet, certainly not. But it does represent the end of a decade
or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged
by the rest of the world --  and by their own leaders  --  to
live way beyond their means. As a result, the United States has
gone from being the largest creditor nation to the world's
largest debtor. For the first time since the early 1980s,
Americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow
growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the U.S. economy
regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and
sustainable growth.
