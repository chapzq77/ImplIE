U.N. chief says Bush asked for increased U.N. presence in Iraq
but he cited security concerns

UNITED NATIONS 2007-01-17 21:55:13 UTC
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that President
George W. Bush asked the United Nations to increase its presence
and role in Iraq but he told the U.S. leader the U.N.'s
operations in the country are limited by security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Ban, who took over as U.N. chief on Jan. 1, said the United
Nations would, nonetheless, try to increase its role in
furthering the International Compact for Iraq, a five-year plan
to ensure that Iraq's government has funds to survive and enact
key political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Ban spoke to reporters on his return from Washington where he
held talks with Bush at the White House on Tuesday and met
Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
later in the day and on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Ban said, he emphasized the importance of "a
strong partnership" between the United States and the United
Nations in addressing U.N. reform and global challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "very much encouraged" that Bush pledged continued
U.S. support and participation "in all areas of U.N. activities,"
and welcomed the "very strong support and warm reception by
Congressional leaders."
</P>
<P>
Ban was asked to explain why he called Bush a "great leader" when
talking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm wondering why you are asking that question," he replied. "In
diplomacy, it is appropriate to address any head of state or
government with due respect and courtesy. I hope you understand
these diplomatic practices."
</P>
<P>
Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his
response.
</P>
<P>
"President Bush wanted to see an increased presence and role of
the United Nations in Iraq," Ban said.
</P>
<P>
"I told President Bush that ... the U.N. presence and operations
in Iraq is actually constrained by the situation on the ground --
I mean the security concerns -- but we will try to continue to
participate and increase our role in Iraq, including the
International Compact with Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan withdrew the U.N.'s
international staff from Iraq in 2003 following two attacks on
U.N. offices in Baghdad and a spate of attacks on humanitarian
workers. The first attack killed the top U.N. envoy in Iraq,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others.
</P>
<P>
U.N. international staffers started returning in August 2004 and
U.N. experts played key roles in helping Iraqis draft a new
constitution and prepare for elections, but the numbers on the
ground are limited because of increasing insecurity, especially
in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has been and will continue wherever and
whenever we can to increase our presence there, but that will be
largely constrained by the security concerns," Ban told reporters
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Tuesday, Ban called the situation in the Middle
East a "source of grave concern" and said "Iraq and elsewhere
needs an urgent attention of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"Particularly when it comes to Iraq, the international community
should have all possible assistance to help Iraqi government and
people to restore peace and stability and recover from economic
devastation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the United States and the United Nations
reached a low point in early 2003 when the U.N. Security Council
refused to authorize a war over Iraq's suspected weapons of mass
destruction. Bush went ahead and led an invasion of Iraq without
U.N. authorization in March 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein from
power.
</P>
<P>
John Bolton, who could not win Senate confirmation as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and resigned last month as his
temporary appointment was about to expire, was highly critical of
the United Nations, especially its reform efforts, and was
unhappy with Annan's performance on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Ban refused to compare his relationship with the United States
with Annan's.
</P>
<P>
"What I stressed during my meetings with president Bush and all
Congressional leaders is that while there was a time when the
relationship between the United Nations and the United States was
not easy, it is time now to look for better days between the
United Nations and the United States," he said. "And I am quite
confident that we will see better days and a mutually cooperative
relationship."
