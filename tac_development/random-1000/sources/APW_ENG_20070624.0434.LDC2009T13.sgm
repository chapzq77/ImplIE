Indian security forces battled suspected militants in an isolated
part of Indian Kashmir on Sunday, in a daylong fight that left
five militants and one Indian soldier dead, a police official
said.

<P>
The battle began after authorities received a tip that a group of
militants had crossed from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. The
gunfight occurred about 170 kilometers (100 miles) north of
Srinagar near the Line of Control, the de facto border that
separates the two parts of Kashmir, said Vijay Kumar, a local
police superintendent.

The battle came as the Indian army foiled another bid by
militants from neighboring Pakistan to sneak into Indian-
controlled Kashmir on Sunday, in a gunfight that left three
rebels dead, officials said.
