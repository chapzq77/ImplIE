Report: Deutsche Telekom CEO asks for patience from shareholders

Deutsche Telekom AG's chief executive has asked that shareholders
show patience, pointing to the global credit crisis as a reason
for the company's lackluster share price, according to an
interview published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rene Obermann took over as head of Europe's biggest telecom
company in late 2006. Last week, the company reported a rise in
first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Telekom shares, worth nearly euro13.50 when Obermann took over,
closed at euro11.81 (US$18.29) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I want to show shareholders what great potential our company
has; and I want to make clear how great an effort we are making
to increase the value of the company," Obermann was quoted as
telling the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, "I can't perform magic," he added. "This is hard work
that requires trust and patience."
</P>
<P>
Obermann noted that Telekom shares performed strongly until
January. "Only with the credit crisis did the whole industry --
so our competitors as well -- fall back," he added, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Obermann said that his company's marketing of Apple's iPhone in
Germany, where it is available only with a two-year contract from
Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit, has been "attractive and
profitable."
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that it has sold more than 100,000 of the
devices in Germany so far.
</P>
<P>
Obermann brushed aside a question as to whether Deutsche Telekom
wants to buy U.S. mobile phone rival Sprint Nextel Corp.
</P>
<P>
"It is our general policy not to comment on such market rumors,"
he said. "That would be irresponsible."
