Russians blame Americans for space glitch

A glitch with Russian computers on board the International Space
Station (ISS) was probably caused by a solar panel installed by
American astronauts, a Russian space construction firm said
Thursday.

"Russian specialists believe that the new solar panel installed
by the Atlantis astronauts during their spacewalk could be the
origin (of the breakdown)," said Irina Gomenyuk, a spokeswoman
for Energia, which designed much of the station.

This "new powerful source of energy caused a malfunction of
sensitive system elements" on the Russian and American segments
of the station, in particular of the electrical supply system,
Gomenyuk was quoted as saying by ITAR-TASS.
</P>
<P>
NASA said earlier Thursday that there had been a breakdown in
communication with Russian computers that control the ISS's
critical oxygen and water supplies. Communications were later
restored.

Two US astronauts spent more than seven hours outside the ISS
Wednesday working on its solar power panels as part of a huge
expansion of the station's generation capacity.
