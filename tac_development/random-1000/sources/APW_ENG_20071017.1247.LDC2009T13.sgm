St. Petersburg legislature approves controversial skyscraper in
Russia ' s Imperial capital

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 2007-10-17 18:11:37 UTC

<P>
The St. Petersburg legislature approved Wednesday the
construction of a skyscraper that will tower near the
architectural treasures of Russia's Imperial-era capital, a
project that has drawn protests from many residents.
</P>
<P>
The city assembly adopted legislation providing for the
construction of a mixed-use complex anchored by a glass-encased
tower that is to rise 320 meters (1,050 feet), more than twice as
high as the stately city's current tallest building.
</P>
<P>
The Okhta project, pushed by the state-controlled natural gas
monopoly OAO Gazprom, has sparked heated debate. And anger over
the plans was a major draw during a handful of protests held by
Russia's struggling political opposition in St. Petersburg over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the building would be a massively discordant element
on the mostly low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg. They cite rules
dating back centuries that have limited the height of buildings
in the center of city founded by Czar Peter the Great more than
300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that the site is not in the historical center.
</P>
<P>
The law approved by the predominantly pro-Kremlin city
legislature sought to appease opponents by decreasing the amount
the city will pay to about 25 billion rubles (US$1 billion;
euro700 million) instead of the entire projected construction
cost of 60 billion rubles (US$2.4 billion; euro1.7 billion), as
previously planned.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom's oil subsidiary, OAO Gazpromneft, will pay most of the
rest, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Amosov, a former head of the assembly's architecture and
planning committee and a leader of opposition to the project,
said the change in the financing scheme was good news but the
city should not be paying anything.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that lawmakers would bring the height of the
tower to 100 meters (328 feet) or less. But Vatanyar Yagya, a
legislator from the dominant United Russia party, said the law
was final and the architectural plans would not be altered.
</P>
<P>
"Okhta ... will be located not in the city's historical center
but at least 500 meters (550 yards) from it," Yagya said. "When
people refer to the czar's height rules, it's about the past ...
In such big cities as Moscow and St. Petersburg there can be only
two lines in construction decisions -- high up or deep down."
</P>
<P>
The complex is to be built by 2016.
