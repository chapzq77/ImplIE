Western observers tend to regard the political success of
Islamists in the Middle East as bad news, because elections have
brought to power such dangerous hard-liners as Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Yet the
strong victory of the main Islamist party in Sunday's election in
Turkey -- the world's prime laboratory for an experiment in
whether Islam is compatible with democracy -- was a very hopeful
development.

The ruling Justice and Development Party, known in Turkey as the
AKP, won a thumping 47 percent of the vote in the parliamentary
contest. It was a repudiation of the secular establishment that
ruled Turkey off and on for decades after being put in place by
Kemal Ataturk in 1923. This elite, which runs the judiciary and
the military, threatened to undermine the country's democracy in
April, when army leaders hinted that they would stage a coup if
an AKP candidate whose wife wears a head scarf were elevated to
the presidency.

In Turkey it's the Islamists, or at least the liberal Islamists
who head the AKP, who promote religious freedom and tolerance,
while secularists' fears of a religious takeover of government
institutions have prompted hysteria over matters as seemingly
harmless as a scarf. The AKP's popularity is soaring because of
measures that have tamed inflation and led to strong economic
growth in just six years, and its support of Turkish efforts to
become a member of the European Union has produced progressive
legal reforms. Meanwhile, the nationalistic Republican People's
Party, the party of Ataturk, opposes EU membership and favors
military intervention in Iraq to discourage attacks from Kurdish
separatists.

It's still unclear whether Turkey's version of tolerant and
moderate Islamic rule will spread to other Muslim countries, or
even survive for long in Turkey. But at this point, it's a beacon
for struggling democracies in places such as Iraq and
Afghanistan, which is why it's in the overwhelming interest of
the United States and Europe to support the newly strengthened
regime of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. For the U.S., that
means a renewed push to resolve the Kurdish problem
diplomatically. For the EU, it means fighting to keep Turkey's
membership drive alive.
