RugbyU: White in England talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World Cup-winning South Africa coach Jake White has held talks
with England rugby chiefs, his agent told The Sunday Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
White guided South Africa to a 15-6 victory over England in the
World Cup final at the Stade de France in Paris on October 20 and
announced on Wednesday that he would quit his post in December,
accusing Springbok bosses of bouncing him out of the job.
</P>
<P>
"They (England) have been in touch," White's agent Craig
Livingstone told The Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
"England are busy with the (post-World Cup) review process and
then they will make a decision.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed an interest (in the England job) and so have
they. We've been talking to Rob Andrew (Rugby Football Union
director of elite rugby)."
</P>
<P>
The RFU have yet to decide if they want to keep coach Brian
Ashton, though they remain publicly supportive of the coach.
</P>
<P>
Soon after arriving back in South Africa with the Webb Ellis
trophy, White said: "England is probably one job most
international coaches wouldn't mind taking because it's a power
that can become a huge force. They have a great rugby culture."
</P>
<P>
England have never hired a foreign head coach.
