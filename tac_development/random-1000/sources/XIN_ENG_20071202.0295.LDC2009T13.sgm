has been ruled out for around two weeks by a recurrence of a
chronic back injury.

The Primera Liga side said that specialist examination had
revealed that the 30 -year-old suffers from a problem with the
discs between several vertebrae in his lower back which provokes
pain in his pelvis and upper leg.

Barcelona said Henry would follow a special programme of
treatment to alleviate the pain and that it was expected he would
be available to play again in around 15 days.

season.
