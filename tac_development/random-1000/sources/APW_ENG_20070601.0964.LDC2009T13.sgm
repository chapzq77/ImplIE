TRIPOLI, Lebanon 2007-06-01 15:17:40 UTC

<P>
Under the cover of artillery barrages, dozens of Lebanese army
tanks and armored carriers on Friday pushed forward against
Islamic militants barricaded in a Palestinian refugee camp in
northern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The concentrated bombardment began in the morning, with heavy
barrages targeting all parts of the Nahr el-Bared camp, where
Fatah Islam militants have been holed up in a 13-day siege by the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
The artillery bombardment sent clouds of white smoke rising from
the camp, and the shelling ignited fires inside it, spewing black
smoke. The militants have barricaded themselves in the camp's
residential neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets and
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
However, reports on the ground indicated the army did not
penetrate deep into the camp, but limited its advance to outer
neighborhoods militants use for sniper fire against army
positions. Nahr el-Bared, like the other 11 Palestinian camps in
Lebanon, has been off limits to Lebanese authorities under a
nearly 40-year-old agreement that allowed Palestinians to run
their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian representative to Lebanon, Abbas Zaki, told al-
Jazeera television that the military action was limited, engaging
militants on the camp's outer areas. He said there would be no
storming of the camp's interior, where thousands of civilians
remain.
</P>
<P>
Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and 10 wounded in the fighting
Friday, according to security officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The officials said that a "unit" of Fatah Islam militants was
"wiped out" but gave no casualty count.
</P>
<P>
The deaths Friday raised to 34 the number of soldiers killed
since fighting between the army and Fatah Islam militants began
on May 20. At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants also have
been killed before Friday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
About 50 armored carriers, battle tanks and military vehicles
from elite units massed at the northern edge of the camp and
drove toward the forward positions, according to an AP Television
News crew at the scene.
</P>
<P>
At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling,
accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored
carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the
troops were in close combat with the militants.
</P>
<P>
But the bombardment again intensified several hours later. The
security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire
the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's
northern edge. They said operation sought to silence the militant
fire to protect army positions.
</P>
<P>
A resident from inside the camp said some Fatah Islam positions
were overtaken and destroyed in the push. He spoke on condition
of anonymity for fear of militant reprisals.
</P>
<P>
"What we have decided is to deal with Fatah Islam as a group, a
terrorist group taking hostages who are left in the camp," said
Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh. He told AP Television
News in Beirut that the army may be seeking to isolate the
militants.
</P>
<P>
"I think the army is determined this time to go ahead and
probably to reduce several pockets of Fatah Islam terrorist," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Ahmed Fatfat told Al-Arabiya television that the
army came under sniper fire earlier Friday and decided to
respond. "It seems they have destroyed those positions."
</P>
<P>
Zaki, the Palestinian representative to Lebanon, expressed hope
that the siege would be tightened. After meeting Lebanese Prime
Minister Fuad Saniora, Zaki spoke of "tangible measures to force
this group to raise its hands in the air and surrender to
justice."
</P>
<P>
A soldier belonging to an armored carriers unit on the camp's
edge said the troops were advancing slowly and fighting building-
to-building, after bombing positions in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"They are in very well-fortified positions," he said of the
militants, adding troops were coming under sniper fire. He spoke
on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak
with the media.
</P>
<P>
Television footage showed the movement of T-55 Russian-made
tanks, French-made Panhard tanks, M-113 U.S.-built armored
personnel carriers and jeeps with 106mm rifles mounted on them.
Sandbags were packed on some of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Military officials would not comment on the movement and
journalists were ordered further back from the camp. But a
statement by the army command said troops came under fire from
the militants and that the army was "responding with accurate and
decisive fire to deter them" while also avoiding civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic gunfire exchanges have continued daily since a truce
halted three first days of heavy fighting. The army has ringed
Nahr el-Bared with hundreds of soldiers, backed by artillery and
tanks, while the government has vowed to crush the militants, who
have said they will fight till the end.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinians have fled the camp, but thousands more
are still inside, along with the Fatah Islam fighters.
