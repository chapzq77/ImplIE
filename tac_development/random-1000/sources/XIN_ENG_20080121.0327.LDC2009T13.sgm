NETANYA, Israel, Aug. 2 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The first Israel International Water Polo Tournament will kick
off Thursday in the Wingate Institute of Sport, close to Netanya.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of Wingate Institute told Xinhua that eight nations
will compete in the four-day tournament, including European
champion Serbia and Russia, which won the bronze medal at the
2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been paired with Russia, Romania, and Australia in
Group A, while Group B includes France, the Netherlands, Serbia
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
All of the teams apart from the Israelis have competed in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Despite fielding the team with the least experience, Israel
captain Amit Seker said he has high hopes for the Israel
International Water Polo Tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest competition is Russia, within the teams that we are
playing," Seker said.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old veteran of the Israel team believes the
tournament will act as a significant boost for Israeli water
polo.
</P>
<P>
"It will be great exposure for the public to water polo," Seker
said.
</P>
<P>
Itzik Koren, president of the Israel Water Polo Association,
added that Israel will progress and improve hugely by playing
against these stronger teams.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is being held under the auspices of FINA, the
organization which runs international water polo. It starts at 9
a.m. on Thursday with Greece facing France, with an opening
ceremony at 6:30 p.m. The event will run through till Sunday when
the playoff games will be held followed by a closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have make this an annual event, though it seems
more likely it will be possible to have it every two years," said
Koren. "We have the seven teams that are leaders in the world of
water polo so it should be a high quality tournament."
</P>
<P>
Men's water polo was first introduced to the Olympic Games in
1900. Since then it has become a renowned and hugely competitive
sport played worldwide, notably in Hungary, Greece, Italy,
Russia, the former Yugoslavia, the United States, Canada and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Although water polo is included in the Maccabiah Games, held in
Israel every four years, a competition of this calibre has never
been held in this country before.
