NEPAL PUTS EVEREST OFF LIMITS FOR OLYMPICS

There are two routes to the world's highest peak and both are
scheduled to be off limits to mountaineers this spring, as
Beijing strives to inaugurate the summer Olympic Games free of
pro-Tibetan protests.
</P>
<P>
Beijing announced earlier this week that the route to the summit
of Mount Everest along the north face of the mountain, in
Chinese-controlled Tibet, would be closed. Now, Nepal has decided
that at least between May 1 and 10, when China has said it plans
to carry up the Olympic torch, no one will be allowed to scale
the summit along the south face, which is in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's tourism minister, Subba Gurung, confirmed in a telephone
interview on Friday that the Chinese government had appealed to
his administration to help prevent disruptions to the Olympic
torch ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Expedition teams will not be allowed to ascend Mount Everest
from the Base Camp," on the Nepali side, he said. "They are
requesting us, the government of Nepal, to be very careful on
this side," he said of the Beijing authorities.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that his ministry had also pressed tour
operators to be extra vigilant of teams scheduled to climb the
mountain before May 1, allowing only climbers who are known to
the operators.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's decision underscores its vulnerability to pressure from
its large and powerful neighbor to the north, even if it involves
forsaking lucrative earnings from expedition permits.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is among Nepal's most important sources of
revenue, and permits to scale Mount Everest alone brought in $4
million into government coffers last year, a significant amount
for what is one of Asia's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
China's plans to have the Olympic torch carried into Tibet over
Mount Everest have drawn protests from groups that advocate
greater autonomy for Tibet, including among monks in the Tibetan
capital, Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
In India, Tibetan exiles were arrested this week as they set off
on foot from Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government in exile
in the northern Indian state of Himachal, en route to Lhasa. The
march is one of several international protests related to Chinese
rule in Tibet, and takes place around the anniversary of a failed
uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet in 1959. The protesters
have since begun a hunger strike, vowing to continue until they
are released.
