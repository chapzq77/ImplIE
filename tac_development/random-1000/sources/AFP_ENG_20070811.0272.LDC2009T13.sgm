<P>
At least two people were killed and four injured after a possible
bomb blast Saturday in an area in Indonesia's East Java that was
being monitored by an anti-terrorist unit, police said.
</P>
<P>
"So far two people are dead. Twelve houses are damaged, including
three badly destroyed, so we can say it was a big explosion, but
we will confirm after more extensive investigation," national
police spokesman Sisno Adiwinoto said.
</P>
<P>
"We found aluminum foil around the blast scene, so it's possible
that this came from a bomb, but we cannot confirm yet what type,"
he told ElShinta radio.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred in Pasuruan, a town about 50 kilometres (30
miles) southeast of Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the blast may have been related to Islamic
militant activity, he said Indonesia's anti-terror unit,
Detachment 88, had "been monitoring activities in the area, but I
cannot confirm specifically the whereabouts, so let's just wait."
</P>
<P>
The owner of the house where the blast originated was being held
for questioning, he added.
</P>
<P>
A doctor told the radio station that four people had also been
hurt.
</P>
<P>
"Four people were rushed here. One of them is in a critical
condition with head injuries," said Fitri, speaking from a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian police have made multiple arrests of Islamic militants
in East Java in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's most wanted man, Malaysian Noordin Mohammad Top, was
at times thought to have been on the run in the area, but he has
repeatedly eluded police.
