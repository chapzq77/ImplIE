NANNING, Oct. 14 (Xinhua)

<P>
Five government officials from Hechi City in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been fired after 450
villagers were poisoned by drinking contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
Dismissed were: Wei Changze, director of Hechi Environmental
Protection Bureau, Gan Hongyuan, deputy head of Jinjiang
District, Zhao Shizhao, an inspector with the Environmental
Protection Bureau, Yu Xian'an, director of the bureau's Jinjiang
District branch and Wei Zhi, head of Dongjiang Town, reported
China News Service.

They were all accused of poor management and surveillance after
450 people were poisoned by drinking water containing arsenic.

<P>
Residents from two villages began showing symptoms like swelling
in the face and eyes, vomiting and blurred vision Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said all patients are in stable condition and are
recovering.

<P>
Environmental testing showed the villages' water source was
polluted by industrial waste discharged from Jinhai Metallurgy
Chemical, a branch of the state-owned Liuzhou China Tin Co. Ltd.
based in Guangxi's Liuzhou City.

The Hechi government said the plant illegally discharged waste
and got away with it because of the Environmental Protection
Bureau's poor surveillance.

The city government suspended operation at the plant and ordered
the company to pay for all the victims hospital bills.
