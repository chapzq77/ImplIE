IN HASSELBECK THEY TRUST
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Hasselbeck they trust      Since stepping back in as the
Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season,
Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
</P>
<P>
Completing 61 percent of his passes.
</P>
<P>
Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in
which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record
3,966 yards last year.
</P>
<P>
Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
</P>
<P>
Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
</P>
<P>
It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making
it appear. Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience
dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck
has endured.
</P>
<P>
From the time he arrived in a 2001 trade with the Green Bay
Packers, Brett Favre's one-time backup has had a dickens of a
time living up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
First, and perhaps foremost, he was coach Mike Holmgren's
handpicked passer to replace a couple of local quarterbacks--Jon
Kitna, who was not re-signed after the 2000 season; and Brock
Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him
the starter not once but twice in 2000.
</P>
<P>
To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the
story of what his first season and a half were like.
</P>
<P>
It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts
in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won). There was a demotion,
which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as
the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season. There
were the ineffective and sometimes downright inept efforts when
Hasselbeck had to step in for an injured Dilfer in 2002.
</P>
<P>
But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations,
the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its
fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for
the sixth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson
said. "He is our leader, and we all need to follow his lead."
</P>
<P>
Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as
engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
</P>
<P>
Hasselbeck's face and voice are seemingly everywhere. In TV
commercials for Reebok and Expedia. In newspaper ads for Jones
Soda. In radio spots for Infiniti. On a huge billboard, promoting
the team's Web site, near the club's old headquarters in
Kirkland. On the covers of just about every preview magazine now
gracing a newsstand near you.
</P>
<P>
Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been
able to accomplish. Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in
watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
</P>
<P>
"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a
peek in his mental rearview mirror. "But when I was positive he
could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to
go, it was actually one of our tough years."
</P>
<P>
It was, in fact, 2002. Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured
Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas. Holmgren handed the
ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose. Twice in the
final five games, Hasselbeck gave new meaning to the West Coast
offense by setting the franchise record for passing yards--first
in San Francisco (427 yards) and then in the season finale in San
Diego (449).
</P>
<P>
"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts
and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren
said. "And that's what happened."
</P>
<P>
Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability
to take them where they want to go.
