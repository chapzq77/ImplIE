Son of Bangladesh ex-PM remanded in custody
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The son of Bangladesh's outgoing prime minister was remanded in
custody on corruption allegations late Monday after a court
rejected his application for bail, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The capital's main court ruled that Tareque Rahman, son of
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia, be
detained for a further month, deputy inspector general of prisons
Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said.
</P>
<P>
"He was brought to (the) central jail in Dhaka at about 10.15 pm
(1615 GMT)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahman was last week arrested and remanded in custody for four
days for questioning over extortion allegations.
</P>
<P>
Rahman had been tipped as a successor to his mother. He is the
son of assassinated former president Ziaur Rahman who played a
leading role in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence.
</P>
<P>
He is senior joint secretary of the BNP, which led a four-party
coalition government until late October, when it handed power to
an interim government tasked with holding elections.
</P>
<P>
In January, President Iajuddin Ahmed cancelled the elections,
stepped down as head of the caretaker government and imposed a
state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a military-backed interim government has held power
and says it will stage polls when a string of reforms aimed at
strengthening democracy have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
These include a major corruption crackdown that has seen at least
45 prominent figures arrested and detained.
