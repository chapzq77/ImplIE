<P>
During Vladimir Putin's eight-year tenure, Russia's presidency
has been a virtually unchallenged seat of power.
</P>
<P>
As Dmitry Medvedev takes the mantle of head of state, however,
the constitutionally enshrined balance between the presidency,
the executive and the legislative could come under strain.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev has already expressed his preference to see Putin serve
as his prime minister. Meanwhile, the strongly pro-Putin United
Russia party holds seven out of every 10 seats in the State Duma,
or parliament.
</P>
<P>
But political experts remain uncertain whether Putin is prepared
to accept the smaller role envisioned in Russia's constitution,
and have speculated on how -- if he chooses -- he might try to
maintain effective leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the President:
</P>
<P>
-- determines domestic and foreign policy;
</P>
<P>
-- commands the armed forces;
</P>
<P>
-- appoints the prime minister;
</P>
<P>
-- has the right to preside over government meetings;
</P>
<P>
-- supervises the intelligence services, the Interior Ministry,
the Foreign Ministry, the Emergency Situations Ministry and the
Justice Ministry;
</P>
<P>
-- nominates appointments to the Constitutional Court and the
office of the Prosecutor General;
</P>
<P>
-- forms and wields direct control over presidential staff;
</P>
<P>
-- acts as guarantor of the constitution and human rights;
</P>
<P>
-- approves federal legislation;
</P>
<P>
-- may dissolve the State Duma under procedures envisioned by the
constitution;
</P>
<P>
-- is entitled to grant state awards and official pardons;
</P>
<P>
-- can be impeached by the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister:
</P>
<P>
-- is appointed by the president no more then two weeks after the
inauguration of the new president;
</P>
<P>
-- heads the government;
</P>
<P>
-- performs an executive function over domestic and foreign
policy;
</P>
<P>
-- may be dismissed by the State Duma;
</P>
<P>
-- proposes candidates to the Cabinet of ministers;
</P>
<P>
-- is first-in-line to the presidency in the event the president
dies, resigns or is rendered incapable;
</P>
<P>
-- oversees the implementation of fiscal and monetary policy;
</P>
<P>
-- manages federal property.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma:
</P>
<P>
-- may amend the constitution by a two-thirds majority;
</P>
<P>
-- can override a presidential veto;
</P>
<P>
-- can approve and reject appointment of a prime minister;
</P>
<P>
-- has the power to file impeachment proceedings against the
president;
</P>
<P>
-- holds debates on decisions to declare war.
