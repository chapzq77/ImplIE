YAOUNDE, May 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
France on Monday cancels 204 billion CFA francs (425 million U.S.
dollars) of debt against Cameroon, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The agreement of the debt cancellation was signed on Monday in
the capital of Yaounde between the French ambassador in Cameroon
Georges Serre and Cameroonian minister for economy and finances
Polycarpe Abah Abah.
</P>
<P>
The debt cancellation falls under the framework of positive
effects of reaching the point of the initiative of Heavily
Indebted Poor Country (PPTE) in April 2008.
</P>
<P>
Serre said France would accompany the efforts of Cameroon in the
area of infrastructure construction, education, health,
agriculture and the promotion of private sector.
</P>
<P>
France's debt cancellation came after those made by the United
States, Belgium, Spain, Canada, Italy, Japan, China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
It also takes place in a moment particularly when France chooses
Nicolas Sarkozy as the new president who promised to review the
partnership which has characterized the relationships between
France and the African countries for a long time.
