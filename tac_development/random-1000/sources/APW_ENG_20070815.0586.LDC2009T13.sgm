Rescuers search for victims of 4 bombings in northern Iraq; death
toll at 200 so far

Rescuers dug through the muddy wreckage of collapsed clay houses
in northwest Iraq on Wednesday, uncovering at least 200 bodies
from suicide truck bombings the U.S. military blamed on al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
The victims were members of a small Kurdish sect -- the Yazidis
-- sometimes attacked by Muslim extremists who consider them
infidels.
</P>
<P>
Four suicide truck bombers struck nearly simultaneously on
Tuesday, killing more people than any other concerted attack
since Nov. 23, when 215 people were killed by mortar fire and
five car bombs in Baghdad's Shiite Muslim enclave of Sadr City.
</P>
<P>
It was most vicious attack yet against the Yazidis, an ancient
religious community in the region. Some 300 people were wounded
in the blasts, said Dakhil Qassim, the mayor of the nearby town
of Sinjar.
</P>
<P>
Qassim said four trucks approached the town of Qahataniya, 120
kilometers (75 miles) west of Mosul, Iraq's third-largest city,
from dirt roads and all exploded within minutes of each other. He
said the casualty tolls were expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
"We are still digging with our hands and shovels because we can't
use cranes because many of the houses were built of clay," Qassim
said. "We are expecting to reach the final death toll tomorrow or
day after tomorrow as we are getting only pieces of bodies."
</P>
<P>
U.S. military spokesman Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner said Wednesday
that he believed the bombings were the work of al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
"The car bombs that were used all had the consistent profile of
al-Qaida in Iraq violence," Bergner told reporters in Baghdad's
heavily fortified Green Zone. "We're continuing to investigate,
and we'll learn more in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
The bombings came as extremists staged other bold attacks on
Tuesday: leveling a key bridge outside Baghdad and abducting five
officials from an Oil Ministry compound in the capital in a raid
using gunmen dressed as security officers. Nine U.S. soldiers
also were reported killed, including five in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
The carnage dealt a serious blow to U.S. efforts to pacify the
country with just weeks to go before the top U.S. commander Gen.
David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker are to deliver a
pivotal report to the U.S. Congress amid a fierce debate over
whether to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus and Crocker issued a joint statement Wednesday
condemning the "barbaric attacks on innocent Iraqi men, women and
children in Ninevah province yesterday."
</P>
<P>
Just last month, Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, the commander of
U.S. forces in northern Iraq, said he proposed reducing American
troop levels in Ninevah, where he said Iraqi army forces were
operating nearly independently.
</P>
<P>
At the time, he predicted the province would shift to Iraqi
government control as early as this month. It was unclear whether
that projection would hold, after Tuesday's staggering death
tolls.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League also issued condolences Wednesday, in a statement
saying "the best way out of this circle of violence is to go
ahead with steady steps toward national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe extremists are attempting to regroup
across northern Iraq after being driven from strongholds in and
around Baghdad, and commanders have warned they expected Sunni
insurgents to step up attacks in a bid to upstage the report.
</P>
<P>
The Yazidis comprise a primarily Kurdish religious sect with
ancient roots, that worships an angel figure considered to be the
devil by some Muslims and Christians. Yazidis, who don't believe
in hell or evil, deny that.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic State in Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, distributed
leaflets a week ago warning residents near the scene of Tuesday's
bombings that an attack was imminent because Yazidis are "anti-
Islamic."
</P>
<P>
The sect has been under fire since some members stoned a Yazidi
teenager to death in April. She had converted to Islam and fled
her family with a Muslim boyfriend, and police said 18-year-old
Duaa Khalil Aswad was killed by relatives who disapproved of the
match.
</P>
<P>
A grainy video showing gruesome scenes of the woman's killing was
later posted on Iraqi Web sites. Its authenticity could not be
independently verified, but recent attacks on Yazidis have been
blamed on al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
A curfew was in place Wednesday across towns west of Mosul, and
U.S. and Iraqi forces were conducting house-to-house searches in
response to the bombings, according to Iraqi police and Army
officers who spoke on condition of anonymity out of security
concerns. Twenty suspects were arrested, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. military heralded success in Day Two of a
nationwide offensive against Sunni insurgents with links to al-
Qaida and Shiite militiamen. Ten thousand U.S. troops and 6,000
Iraqi soldiers were involved in air and ground assaults across
Diyala and Salahuddin provinces, both north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. troops killed 11 suspected terrorists and
detained four others in operations against al-Qaida in central
and northern Iraq, the military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 artillery rounds, rockets and bombs were dropped in
the Diyala River valley late Monday and early Tuesday, another
statement said. Three suspected al-Qaida gunmen were killed and
eight were taken prisoner, the military said. American troops
also discovered several roadside bombs rigged to explode, as well
as a booby-trapped house, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the Iraqi capital, U.S. special forces and Iraqi soldiers
detained three suspected al-Qaida in Iraq leaders and four Shiite
militia suspects in separate raids Tuesday, the military said.
Another Shiite extremist accused of attacking U.S. forces was
captured the same day in Najaf, a Shiite holy city 160 kilometers
(100 miles) south of Baghdad, it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr
took to the streets in Najaf in a peaceful protest against the
detention. Demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and called
for an end to what they called random raids and rights violations
targeting the movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military issued another statement Wednesday putting the
death toll in the Yazidi bombings at 60. But the Iraqi estimate
was based on body counts from local hospitals and morgues to
which U.S. officials had no access so the total was believed to
be higher.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki issued a statement Wednesday
blaming the bombings on "terrorism powers who seek to fuel
sectarian strife and damage our people's national unity."
</P>
<P>
"These crimes will not prevent us from standing up to challenges
and moving ahead with the political process to impose law and
bring criminals and outlaws to justice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said U.S. helicopters swooped in to evacuate wounded to
hospitals in Dahuk, a Kurdish city near the Turkish border about
90 kilometers (60 miles) north of Qahataniya. Civilian cars and
ambulances also rushed injured to hospitals in Dahuk, police
said.
</P>
<P>
AP Television News footage showed an emergency room in Dahuk
overwhelmed with patients. Nurses dabbed the bloodied face of a
young boy and held his hand as he wailed in pain. A toddler with
bruised eyes had bandages wrapped around his head and arms.
</P>
<P>
In other violence Wednesday, police said five people were killed
at a fake checkpoint near Khalis, about 80 kilometers (50 miles)
north of Baghdad. The checkpoint was set up by al-Qaida militants
who ambushed a minibus carrying civilians, police said. Among the
dead was a 5-year-old child, they added.
</P>
<P>
South of Baghdad, a suicide car bomber killed two people and
wounded seven, according to Iraqi police.
</P>
<P>
And a parked car bomb targeted a police patrol in southern Mosul,
killing a civilian and injuring ten others, police and army
officers said.
