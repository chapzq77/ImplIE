TRAVEL Q &amp;amp;amp;  A: IRELAND ' S COUNTY KERRY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. We are a group of 14 who are visiting Ireland in August for 10
days. We will land in Dublin. I have heard the most beautiful
area is Kerry. Can you help me in suggesting an itinerary?

A. You won't find much consensus on what's the most beautiful
area of Ireland, though Killarney National Park, the Dingle
Peninsula and the Ring of Kerry -- all in County Kerry -- have
their passionate advocates. To avoid a day or two of driving from
Dublin, you will want to catch a connecting flight from there to
Kerry Airport (www.kerryairport.com), near Killarney, a route
served by the low-cost carrier Ryanair as of July 1.

Spend a night or two in the pretty little town of Killarney. The
Arbutus Hotel (College Street, 353-64-31037;
www.arbutuskillarney.com) is a solid, mid-priced accommodation
option, with doubles in August from 170 euros, or $270 at $1.62
to the euro, with breakfast. The next day take the curvy road
through Killarney National Park, which abuts the town. There
you'll find waterfalls, photo-worthy views, gardens and great
hiking trails.

The next two or three days you can drive the Ring of Kerry, a
route of more than 100 miles of natural beauty and small towns
along the outer edge of Iveragh Peninsula. From Portmagee, about
mid-Ring, you can make a day trip out to the small and rugged
Skellig Islands. The Dingle Peninsula is a shorter drive, but no
less beautiful. The town of Tralee is a good place to spend an
evening before or after the Dingle loop; I like the Abbey Gate
Hotel (Maine Street; 353-66-7129888; abbeygate-hotel.com) there;
doubles are 120 to 140 euros in August, with breakfast.

<P>
If you have a few days left, you could drive north to County
Clare, home of the stunning Cliffs of Moher and the rugged
landscape of the Burren, and continue on to the port town of
Galway. This is the region explored in Dan Barry's recent New
York Times article "Does the 'Real' Ireland Still Exist?" (May
18). Another option is to proceed to Dublin (see The Times' "36
Hours column" of July 13).
