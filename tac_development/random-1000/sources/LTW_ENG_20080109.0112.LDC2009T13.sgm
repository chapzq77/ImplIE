Q and A: Fashion

Excerpts from a recent Washington Post online reader chat with
Suzanne D'Amato, deputy editor for The Post's Sunday Source, and
Janet Bennett, washingtonpost.com fashion and beauty editor.

Q: I've been trying to find a large, roomy leather tote for
carrying to work, but I am debating if it's really worth the back
pain for such a heavy load. Is the large tote trend going to die
down this spring? Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size
bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
</P>
<P>
A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
Do you want to carry magazines, files, bottled water and gym
clothes with you every day? Then a big tote is essential. If not,
a smaller bag might be right for you. The gargantuan bag (a la
Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you
need a big bag I say go for it. One thing to note in the back
pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own
because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their
design. I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it
-- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for
my back, even when empty. So it's best to buy these in person.
</P>

Q: I currently bring a Manhattan Portage bag ... I feel like the
bags are from the 90's. But I'm at a loss for a replacement bag
that I can wear over my shoulder and across my chest, yet still
fit in my lunch, a book, my iPod, phone, etc., etc. Tips?
</P>
<P>
A (D'Amato): Nothing wrong with Manhattan Portage, but I
understand why you're ready to upgrade. I saw some great leather
(or maybe they were pleather?) messenger bags at Target. They
cost $30 to $40 each and were nice and roomy, with some cool,
understated hardware that distinguished them from the pack. I'd
also suggest scouring the men's furnishings dept at department
stores -- they often stock more of these styles than ladies' bag
departments.

Q: Four of us girls (late 20s and early 30s) are going to ...
(the ballet) on a Saturday night. Some of them want to get really
dressed up, but I'm trying to convince them that if we show up in
long dresses, we'll probably be outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
A( Kelly): I would advise against wearing a long dress. It's just
not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable
and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm wearing a Nicole Miller leopard print dress to a cocktail
party. Would you suggest I wear a pashmina or jacket to ward off
the chill? Also, should my accessories be understated and
neutral, like golds and browns? I'm also wondering about bare
legs this time of year. Should I wear Spanx and closed-toed
shoes, or are open-toed sandals (gold) acceptable?
</P>
<P>
A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
</P>
<P>
1. A cropped jacket of some sort would be more chic than a
pashmina, which is a perfectly acceptable but not terribly
fashion-forward choice. Velvet might be a bit much with leopard
print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux)
fur.
</P>
<P>
2. Yes, matte bronze or even dark burgundy would look great here.
If you choose gold, make sure it's nothing too sparkly-bright.
</P>
<P>
3. Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable. And if
this weather keeps up, they'll be practical, too!
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently purchased a long, black, boyfriend-style cardigan
... (that) ends about two inches above my knee with buttons going
down the front and has three-quarter-length sleeves. Can I wear
it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or
should I pair it with jeans?
</P>
<P>
A (D'Amato): You could try a dress if it's a slinky, Calvin
Klein/Helmut Lang-type sheath style, cut from a thin T-shirt
fabric. Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in
details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look
lumpy under the cardigan. Alternately, I'd try wearing the
cardigan as a dress on its own, or layering it over skinny jeans.
Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital)
last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.
