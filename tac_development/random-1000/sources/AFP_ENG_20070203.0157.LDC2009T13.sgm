Problem-prone Swedish nuclear reactor shut down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Swedish nuclear reactor was shut down on Saturday after a fault
was found in rubber pannels in the reactor's housing, the plant's
operators said.
</P>
<P>
Forsmark 1 was shut down after a sample taken from one of three
rubber pannels in the reactor's outer housing was found to have
lost its required elasticity, spokesman for Forsmark's operator
FKA, Claes-Inge Andersson, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The rubber had become stiff ... it needs to be elastic,"
Andersson said.
</P>
<P>
Further tests were to be carried out on the reactor on Sweden's
east coast.
</P>
<P>
Later on Saturday initial tests on Forsmark 1's sister reactor,
Forsmark 2, also led to its shutdown for similar analysis.
</P>
<P>
"We will do the same work on Forsmark 2 as we are doing on
Forsmark 1," Andersson said.
</P>
<P>
It was not known when either of the reactors would resume power
production, he added.
</P>
<P>
The twin shutdowns follow the emergence earlier in the week of a
damning internal report into safety standards at Forsmark, made
public six months after a serious incident at the plant.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed lax security on a series of "potentially fatal
accidents", including a nitrogen gas leak, employees handling
live electrical wires, falls in the workplace and employees sent
home for failing sobriety tests.
</P>
<P>
An electricity failure at the facility on July 25, 2006, led to
the immediate shutdown of Forsmark 1 after two of four backup
generators, which supply power to the reactor's cooling system,
malfunctioned for about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have suggested that a catastrophic reactor meltdown
was narrowly avoided.
</P>
<P>
The incident prompted authorities to temporarily shut down five
of Sweden's 10 reactors for security checks and maintenance. Some
of the reactors remained shut down for several months.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate has asked prosecutors to
investigate whether FKA broke the law in its response to the
malfunction at Forsmark.
</P>
<P>
On Friday a prosecutor announced the launch of a preliminary
investigation into FKA's handling of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power accounts for nearly half of Sweden's electricity
production.
</P>
<P>
The country has shut two of its 12 nuclear reactors since 1999 as
part of a plan to phase out nuclear power over the next 30 or so
years, or when the reactors' lifespan expires.
