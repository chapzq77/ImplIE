At Least 7 Die in South Beirut Gunbattle

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 28
</P>
<P>
At least seven civilians were killed Sunday evening during an
hourslong clash between Lebanese soldiers and young Shiite Muslim
men protesting electricity cuts, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
A dozen or more people were wounded in the melee when gunfire
erupted as demonstrators were throwing rocks and fireworks at a
phalanx of troops. Several residents in an adjacent Christian
neighborhood were injured by a hand-grenade explosion, Lebanese
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The violence came two days after a massive car bomb killed one of
the country's top intelligence officials and 12 days after
another explosion struck a U.S. Embassy convoy, killing three
civilians. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora declared Monday a day of
national mourning and ordered universities and schools closed.
</P>
<P>
"In these moments, our country is passing through its most
difficult and dangerous times," he said.
</P>
<P>
The violence was the latest sign of deteriorating security in a
country that has been paralyzed by a political standoff between
two camps, one favoring the West and the other backed by Iran and
Syria, over the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted near the southern Beirut neighborhood of Ain
al-Roumaneh, site of a 1975 massacre of Palestinians that helped
spark a 15-year civil war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers met in Cairo, Egypt, Sunday with
representatives of the two Lebanese camps and called on them to
end their deadlock, which has set the religiously and politically
divided country adrift. The ministers urged both sides to back
Gen. Michel Suleiman, a Christian, as president when parliament
convenes Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of demonstrators, some wearing ski masks, gathered in
the streets of the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya to protest
power cuts. They said the disruption had left them with about six
hours of electricity a day, compared with 21 hours for parts of
central Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans and hurling epithets against Siniora's
U.S.-backed government, they raced around the streets on motor
scooters, set tires ablaze and tried to block roads, including
the route to the airport.
</P>
<P>
"In south Beirut, people have interests and lives, too," said
Suleiman, a 19-year-old demonstrator who declined to give his
last name. "We have jobs and work to do, and without electricity
we can't do anything."
</P>
<P>
An official of the Amal Party, a Shiite political group, was
killed in an unexplained volley of gunfire. The angry crowds
swelled. They tossed tires and explosives into a bonfire, set
cars on fire and showered security forces with rocks.
</P>
<P>
Gunfire again erupted. One victim in his late teens fell to the
ground, choking as he lay in a pool of blood. Ambulances waiting
at the scene rushed to take him and other wounded people to a
nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear whether the victims were struck by gunfire
from troops. In a statement, the army said it was launching an
investigation to determine the identity of the shooters.
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators said they were loyal to Amal, one of
the groups in the camp led by the Shiite militia Hezbollah and
backed by Iran and Syria. The official Lebanese news agency also
reported violent demonstrations in the country's mostly Shiite
south. But Amal disavowed the Beirut demonstrations and called on
protesters to clear the streets.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government Future Party, led by pro-American politician
Saad Hariri, blamed Damascus and Tehran for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"The forces of the Syrian and Iranian front are causing the
situation to explode and provoking dangerous riots," said a
statement issued by the party.
