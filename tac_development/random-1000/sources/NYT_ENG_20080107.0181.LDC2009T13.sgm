GIULIANI ' S CAMP EYES TOP-3 FINISH

Supporters lower their expectations for Mich. primary with
strategy to focus on later contests.

Rudy Giuliani's Michigan supporters say they're aiming for a top-
three finish in Michigan's Republican presidential primary, a
lowering of expectations for the one-time leader here that
highlights Giuliani's high-risk strategy of bypassing the
campaign's earliest contests.
</P>
<P>
Polls show the former New York mayor could finish fourth, or even
lower, in today's New Hampshire primary, after a fifth-place
showing in the Iowa caucuses. And with Mitt Romney and John
McCain expected to begin intense campaign efforts in Michigan
Wednesday, Giuliani will largely bypass the state, spending some
time and money here but continuing to focus on Florida's Jan. 29
primary and the two-dozen states holding contests on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
"If we're in the top three, I'd feel very good about that,"
Giuliani's Michigan campaign chairwoman, Rep. Candice Miller,
R-Harrison Twp., said Monday. Such a finish would do nothing, she
said, to change Giuliani's strategy, which relies on competing in
larger states with more convention delegates at stake .
</P>
<P>
But many analysts question whether Giuliani can remain
competitive in those large states without at least some hint of
success in the early rounds. The last Detroit News-WXYZ Action
News poll of Republican voters, in mid-December, showed Giuliani
in third place at 12 percent, down 16 points from a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"History says he needs some success before Florida to be
successful in Florida," said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac
Polling Institute, which has surveyed Florida voters throughout
the year. The danger, Brown said, is that the lead Giuliani held
in Florida and other large states throughout the summer and fall
may disappear .
</P>
<P>
Giuliani's camp has fought against such perceptions for months;
campaign manager Michael DuHaime told reporters in November that
Giuliani's leads in Florida, New York and New Jersey were
"momentum-proof," unassailable by any candidate, even one who
swept through the early contests.
</P>
<P>
Of course, no such sweep has developed. Iowa winner Mike Huckabee
is an also-ran in New Hampshire, where Romney and McCain are
battling in a close race. After Michigan comes South Carolina's
Jan. 19 primary, in which Huckabee, McCain, Romney and Fred
Thompson all have gotten significant support in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
Such a fractured field is all Giuliani could have hoped for, said
Miller.
</P>
<P>
"We talked about this strategy very early on: Don't fire until
you see the whites of their eyes," she said. "It makes some
people nervous, but we've talked about it for months: The thing
to do is to win delegates."
</P>
<P>
The math is compelling. New Hampshire today will award 21
delegates to this summer's national convention; Iowa technically
awarded none at all. Florida will award 114, which the Feb. 5
states combine for roughly half the overall total.
</P>
<P>
Miller said Giuliani will try to win at least a handful of
Michigan's 60 delegates (30 if the national GOP's penalties
against the state stick), focusing on congressional districts
where the campaign's internal polling shows it has the best
chance to win. The winner in each of the state's 15 congressional
districts receives three delegates, with 15 more going to the
statewide winner.
