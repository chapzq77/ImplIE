TALLINN, Estonia 2007-02-23 14:55:49 UTC

<P>
A scuffle broke out at a war monument Friday after several
Estonian nationalists tried to lay a wreath to victims of Soviet
oppression but were confronted by another group.
</P>
<P>
The fight came one day after President Toomas Hendrik Ilves
vetoed a law calling for the monument's removal.
</P>
<P>
The monument, dubbed the Bronze Soldier, symbolizes 50 years of
Soviet oppression for Estonians -- but for ethnic Russians it
represents the defeat of fascist Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was hurt. Everybody backed off and left their own way,"
Tallinn police spokesman Harrys Puusepp.
</P>
<P>
He said no arrests were made but a inquiry was launched to
determine whether the nationalist group -- the Estonian National
Movement -- had violated regulations since they had not
registered their protest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Estonian National Movement held a legal
demonstration outside the Russian Embassy on Friday to protest at
Russia's alleged interference in Estonia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Puusepp said some 10 people took part in the protest.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Estonia and Russia have deteriorated over
Estonia's intention to remove the Bronze Soldier and a war grave
nearby.
