unacceptable '

<P>
The German Defense Ministry said Monday that an incident in which
a soldier was told to imagine facing hostile blacks in the Bronx
while firing a machine gun was "absolutely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"This behavior is absolutely unacceptable and contradicts the
training standards of the German army," defense ministry
spokesman Thomas Raabe said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the army was investigating the incident, recorded in an
Internet video, and would probably complete the inquiry in two to
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The video -- in which an army instructor tells the soldier to
shoot and yell obscenities -- aired on German national television
Saturday and prompted calls for an apology by the New York City
borough's president.
</P>
<P>
The video shows an instructor and a soldier in camouflage
uniforms in a forest. The instructor tells the soldier, "You are
in the Bronx. A black van is stopping in front of you. Three
African-Americans are getting out and they are insulting your
mother in the worst ways. ... Act."
</P>
<P>
The soldier fires his machine gun several times and yells an
obscenity several times in English. The instructor then tells the
soldier to curse even louder.
</P>
<P>
The German Defense Ministry said the video was shot in July 2006
at barracks in the northern town of Rendsburg, and that the army
has been aware of it since January.
</P>
<P>
"We found out about it because a soldier gave his superior a CD
on which one could see the images," Raabe said during a news
conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The video was greeted with indignation in New York, but has drawn
only muted reaction in Germany despite following two other
incidents that raised concern about training in the German army.
A group of instructors is now on trial for allegedly abusing
recruits, while newspaper photos of German soldiers posing with
skulls in Afghanistan caused a stir.
</P>
<P>
The Germany army is made up largely of draftees, but increasingly
is called on to carry out sensitive overseas peacekeeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
A headline Monday in the taz newspaper focused on U.S. reaction
to the video scandal: "Army Video Horrifies New Yorkers."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with AP Television News, Raabe said the incident
was exceptional.
</P>
<P>
"In every society, in Germany, in France, in Britain and in the
United States something like that happens but I think it is
really an isolated case," Raabe said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a success story for more than fifty years in our German
army and it is really seldom that something like that happens. I
think it is not a special German problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. has
called for whoever was responsible to be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
"The German government obviously has work to do to correct
something that is insidious. ... Clearly these folks don't know
anything about African-Americans or the Bronx," he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The video vanished from the German myvideo.de Web site but
reappeared on youtube.com.
