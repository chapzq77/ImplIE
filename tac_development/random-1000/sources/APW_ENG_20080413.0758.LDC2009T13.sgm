The president of the World Bank on Sunday urged immediate action
to deal with rising food prices that have caused hunger and
deadly violence in several countries.
</P>
<P>
Robert Zoellick said the international community has "to put our
money where our mouth is" and act now to help hungry people. "It
is as stark as that."
</P>
<P>
He called on goverments to rapidly carry out commitments to
provide the U.N. World Food Program with $500 million (euro315.8
million) in emergency aid it said it needs by May 1.

After a meeting of the bank's policy-setting committee, Zoellick
said that the fall of the government in Haiti over the weekend
after a wave of deadly rioting and looting over food prices
underscores the importance of quick international action. A U.N.
police officer was killed in Haiti's capital on Sunday.

the Philippines.
