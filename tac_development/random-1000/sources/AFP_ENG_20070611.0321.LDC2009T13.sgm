US entertainment and media giant Walt Disney Co. is teaming up
with Indian film studio Yash Raj Films to make Disney-branded
animation films with the voices of Bollywood stars, the Wall
Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Disney has struggled to make money in India, which has a vast
domestic film market, with its "American fare," but believes that
an animated story featuring the voices of well-known Indian film
stars could be a commercial hit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A Disney spokesperson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said the new joint effort between Disney and Yash Raj
Films will be formally announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new venture's first project will be an animated tale
featuring the voices of Bollywood stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena
Kapoor.
</P>
<P>
Yash Raj is one of Bollywood's most established studios and the
partnership is likely to produce "at least one animation film per
year," Yash Raj's chief executive Sanjeev Kohli was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report also cited Disney executive Shyam P.S. as saying that
Disney will start with simple stories mixing singing, dancing,
humor and the "in your face" emotion typical of Bollywood-style
productions.
</P>
<P>
In another move, Disney is taking US franchises and making Indian
versions of them, such as "High School Musical," whose Indian
cast members are likely to be chosen in an "American Idol"-style
competition, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Disney's overall Indian film production could be ramped up to
around eight movies a year if the push is successful, executives
said.
</P>
<P>
Production costs are usually cheaper in India than in the United
States, the Journal pointed out.
