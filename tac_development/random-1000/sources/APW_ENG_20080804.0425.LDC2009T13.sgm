A 31-year-old Greek man accused of beheading his girlfriend with
a cleaver is in critical condition after being shot by police,
Health Ministry officials said Monday.

Police said restaurant cook Thanassis Arvanitis severed the head
of his 25-year-old girlfriend Sunday on the holiday island of
Santorini. Arvanitis agreed to surrender to police officers, then
attacked one officer with the cleaver and escaped in a patrol
car, police said in a statement. He was shot three times by
police while trying to flee.

Three female bystanders were also injured in the clash in
Bourboulos, near the island's main town of Fira. A 21-year-old
Greek female tourist was hit by a ricocheting police bullet,
while the suspect crashed into an oncoming motorbike, injuring
two female doctors, both aged 26.

Arvanitis and the three bystanders were being treated in a state
hospital in Athens. The two doctors were making a good recovery
after suffering leg injuries, said Health Minister Dimitris
Avramopoulos. The tourist was in stable condition. The injured
policeman received treatment for facial wounds on Santorini.

Following an argument, "the (suspect) slaughtered their dog and
threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to
kill the woman ... totally severing her head," a statement from
the South Aegean Police Department said.

"The attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the
victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other."

"It's hard to believe that people like this circulate among us,"
said Santorini Mayor Angelos Roussos.
