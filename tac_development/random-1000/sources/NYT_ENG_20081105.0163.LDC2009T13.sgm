Sure, the national race is the big story, but there's plenty to
chew on from Tuesday's election for us local yokels too. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
??The environment sells. Anything on the ballot that looked like
an environment or conservation measure won. That included
Amendment 4, a tax break for conservation land, a property tax in
Hillsborough County for buying environmental land, and tighter
rules in Pinellas County for protecting it.
</P>
<P>
??Antitax sentiment sells, too. Anything that looked like a tax
break passed. That included Amendment 3 (hurricane and energy
improvements to homes), Amendment 4 (a tax break for conservation
land) and Amendment 6 (a tax break for "working waterfront"
property).
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the voters rejected Amendment 8, which would have
allowed counties to create a tax to support community colleges.
And two Hernando County commissioners, both Democrats, were
defeated in campaigns that featured antitax themes.
</P>
<P>
??Amendment 2 fallout. Okay, we've put a ban on same-sex marriage
in the Florida Constitution. But it seems likely we'll need court
rulings on what the "substantial equivalent" of marriage means.
It wouldn't be surprising to see legal attacks on domestic-
partner health benefits and such.
</P>
<P>
??Deborah Clark. The Pinellas elections supervisor caught a lot
of flak for limiting early voting to three sites, but it didn't
translate into votes against her. She won with 61.37 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
??Buddy Johnson. The Hillsborough election supervisor managed to
run neck and neck with his challenger despite a Keystone Cops
history of mishaps. Credit it to party identification, name
recognition from his extensive self-promotion and an opposition
that perhaps took too much for granted.
</P>
<P>
??Female judicial candidates. Before we go overboard with the
gender factor in the Pasco-Pinellas race between Susan L. Gardner
and Robert Angus Williams, consider that at least three women
around the state lost circuit judge races to men. Is it possible
that a public defender type facing off against a big-law-firm,
developers' attorney was a factor, too?
</P>
<P>
??A bright side for Florida Republicans. In Florida, the GOP lost
a net of just one congressional seat, held its commanding lead in
the Legislature, re-elected virtually all of its local
incumbents, and delivered 48 percent of the vote to the national
ticket even in a high-tide Democratic year.
</P>
<P>
??Incumbency, not party. Whether Democrat or Republican,
incumbents won across the board in the Tampa Bay area with just
three exceptions  a Republican Hillsborough commissioner with a
truckload of baggage, and the two Democratic Hernando
commissioners. Doesn't this suggest voters are prone to vote for
names, especially incumbents they know, more than party? Doesn't
this also show the failure of the Democrats' attempts to generate
straight-party voting?
</P>
<P>
??Who cares about school boards? Some of the biggest dropoffs
between the votes cast in the presidential race and the number of
votes cast in down-ballot races involved school boards. Dunno
why. In Hillsborough, school races outdrew only the Soil and
Water Conservation District.
</P>
<P>
??The system worked, didn't it? For a state using its third
voting system in three national elections, things went pretty
well.
