<HEADLINE>
Long-shot Huckabee determined to fight to the end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Huckabee may still be a long shot in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination, but his weekend victories in
Kansas and Louisiana proved he is likely to be a thorn in the
side of frontrunner John McCain for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
Despite McCain's solid lead in the battle for delegates to the
Republican nominating convention, which analysts call nearly
impossible to overcome, Huckabee insisted Sunday he was going to
fight all the way to the wire.
</P>
<P>
That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn
rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it
needs unity against the powerful Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"When I hear people say it's practically impossible, nothing is
impossible," the former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher
told CBS television Sunday when asked about his chances.
</P>
<P>
"This country was built on the impossible. And it's impossible
that I'm still in the race. That's what most people would have
said a few months ago."
</P>
<P>
Showing the force of his evangelical Christian base, Huckabee
trounced McCain on Saturday in Kansas's caucuses, winning 60
percent support against the Arizona senator's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, Huckabee squeaked out a narrow win, 43 percent to
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
And he narrowly lost the Washington state caucus, which voted 26
percent for McCain, 24 percent for Huckabee.
</P>
<P>
He said Sunday however that he would launch a challenge to the
Washington State caucus results, complaining that far too few of
votes were counted  when the election was called in McCain's
favor.
</P>
<P>
And he rejected calls for to pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
"The fact they're blowing against me hardly motivates me to
quit," he told reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It motivates me to play harder. If they think they're getting a
chorus of voices that will make me say okay, it's time to leave,
they don't know me very well."
</P>
<P>
Huckabee remains way behind McCain in the crucial delegate count,
with just 234 to McCain's 724 -- out of 1,191 needed to clinch
the nomination -- according to poll-tracker
RealClearPolitics.com.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to concede any inevitability Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to stay in until somebody has 1,191 delegates
because that's the magic number at which a person is the nominee
of the party," Huckabee insisted on CBS.
</P>
<P>
"People in many, many states, including large states like Texas,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and all across this country, Nebraska, North
Carolina -- they've not even voted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So are we to tell them, 'Forget your vote; we don't even care
what you think?"
</P>
<P>
Huckabee's success has come on the back of the party's
conservatives, who have made well-known their disgust with
McCain, branding him a "closet liberal."
</P>
<P>
Christian conservatives have especially latched onto Huckabee's
religious values and opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
"I do think (McCain) has got some challenges with not just the
evangelicals, but frankly the economic conservatives, because of
his opposition to the (President George W.) Bush tax cuts,"
Huckabee said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
McCain's views on immigration "were way out of the mainstream and
quite unorthodox. He has been often the voice in the wilderness,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Huckabee also argues that his experience as a state governor and
his stance for a radical reform of the US tax system would make
him a better president.
</P>
<P>
"I've actually run a government," he told CBS. "I think senators
have the luxury of taking several issues, maybe two or three, and
they can specialize in them."
</P>
<P>
"But in terms of seeing the whole playing field, they've never
managed the whole field."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Huckabee's refusal to pull out of the race -- as did
Mitt Romney on Thursday -- could deepen the party division
between conservatives and Republicans ready to back McCain
because he stands the best chance of beating the Democratic
nominee in November.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives are also said to hope their resistance to
McCain could push him to adopt more of their positions, like an
absolute opposition to abortion and a crackdown on illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
One widely-reported scenario has Huckabee accepting to be
McCain's vice presidential running mate in the election.
</P>
<P>
But Huckabee insisted he was not planning to run with McCain --
as president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Senator McCain would select me anyway. I'm not
sure I would select him," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no discussions for such a thing because, at this
point, I'm still running for president. There's no other reason
for me to think otherwise."
