<P>
A spiritual leader of Israel's religious Zionist movement, Rabbi
Avraham Shapira, has died after a long illness in Jerusalem. He
was 94.
</P>
<P>
Shapira died Thursday after being hospitalized earlier in the
week due to deteriorating health. Thousands of his followers had
prayed for his well-being in recent days at the Western Wall, the
holiest Jewish site in Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
The rabbi of the movement that forms the backbone of Israel's
settlement enterprise was most known in Israel for his call on
observant soldiers in 2005 to disobey orders to dismantle 21
Jewish settlements during Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip
that year.
</P>
<P>
Many Orthodox Jews oppose any withdrawal from the West Bank or
Gaza, considering them part of their God-given Promised Land.
Shapira's call helped foster widespread fervent opposition to the
pullout and fears of clashes between settlers, their backers and
the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from Gaza and four settlements in the northern
West Bank was completed with no great violence or casualties in
September 2005.
</P>
<P>
Shapira also opposed the first Israeli-Palestinian peace accords
in 1993, saying Jewish law forbade Israel from transferring holy
land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shapira was a chief rabbi in Israel for ten years beginning in
1983. He was a top adjudicator on the Torah and a leader of his
movement's Mercaz Harav religious seminary in Jerusalem. He was
to be buried in Jerusalem later Friday.
