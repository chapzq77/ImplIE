<P>
Mexico's peso continues to weaken against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The daily benchmark rate fell to more than 14 to the U.S. dollar
in early morning trading before recovering to about 13 per
dollar. Stocks also fell 1 percent after the market opened.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's slide marks the peso's lowest real level against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso has fallen steeply since closing last week at 11.1 to
the dollar. The Bank of Mexico gave Tuesday's fixed rate as
12.12.
</P>
<P>
Barclay's Capital analyst Jimena Zuniga says the slide is a
response to falling oil prices and Mexico's deteriorating growth
outlook amid turmoil in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The country's treasury secretary recently lowered the 2008 growth
forecast to 2.5 percent.
