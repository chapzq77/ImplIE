Political rivalries flare again on Mexican Independence Day

MEXICO CITY 2007-09-16 02:23:28 UTC

<P>
Bitter political rivalries flared at independence celebrations in
Mexico for a second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City's central plaza was the scene of competing
celebrations on Saturday -- divided by metal fences and thousands
of police officers, as the nation continues to struggle with last
year's hotly contested presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with custom, President Felipe Calderon was to mark the
start of Independence Day by stepping out on a National Palace
balcony at 11:00 p.m. (0400GMT) and crying, "Viva Mexico!"
Mexicans gathered below in the Zocalo, or main square,
traditionally answer the president's shouts in unison.
</P>
<P>
But this year, in another corner of the plaza, thousands of
Calderon's detractors led by Sen. Rosario Ibarra planned their
own "grito," or cry of independence. A third celebration was in
the works by Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard.
</P>
<P>
Ibarra is a political ally of leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador, who narrowly lost the July 2006 election to the
conservative Calderon. Lopez Obrador claims the election was
tainted by fraud and has refused to accept Calderon's victory.
Mayor Ebrard is a member of Lopez Obrador's Democratic Revolution
Party.
</P>
<P>
Last September -- following two months of protests that snarled a
main avenue in the capital to demand a recount -- then-President
Vicente Fox avoided a confrontation by moving the ceremony
hundreds of miles (kilometers) away to Dolores Hidalgo, where
Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo made the first cry for
independence from Spain in 1810.
</P>
<P>
Lopez Obrador said this year he would celebrate with followers in
San Jose Tenango in southern Oaxaca state, one of the poorest
municipalities in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, factions staked out their turf in the Zocalo days
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
The president's office set up metal fencing around a section in
front of the National Palace, while Lopez Obrador's supporters
set up tents on the square's opposite end.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, hundreds of vendors selling confetti and snacks
crowded into the square, which was decorated with red, white and
green lights -- the colors of the Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans arriving for the nighttime celebration went through
metal detectors and were received by blaring speakers on
opposites sides of the plaza competing for their attention -- and
making it impossible to hear.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said no one should be left out of the Independence Day
celebration, calling it an opportunity "for harmony and
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
Veronica Franco, who planned to attend Ibarra's event, said she
came to protest Calderon's presidency.
</P>
<P>
"We're here to show that the Mexican people are not fools and
that we won't allow for another fraud to take place," Franco
said.
