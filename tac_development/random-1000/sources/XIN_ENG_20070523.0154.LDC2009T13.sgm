<P>
The Beijing Olympic Games organizers Wednesday launched a design
competition in a bid to collect ideas for costumes used for the
victory ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The competition opened to both professionals and general public
both at home and abroad, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be an open competition not only welcoming participants
from China but also from abroad," said Lu Hao, vice mayor of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We already sent invitations to some professional designers and
companies but it doesn't mean that we have any bias against non-
professionals," he said. "Everyone's idea will be paid equal
attention."
</P>
<P>
The participants can find the procedure and submission form
through the official website of the Beijing Olympic Games
(www.beijing2008.cn).

<P>
They are asked to design the costumes for medal/ flower bearer
(ladies), presenter usher (ladies), athlete escort (ladies) and
flag bear (men).
</P>
<P>
The deadline for design submission is June 25.
