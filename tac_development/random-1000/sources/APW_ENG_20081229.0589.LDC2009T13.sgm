Thousands protest Gaza assault in Lebanon

BEIRUT, Lebanon 2008-12-29 18:26:14 UTC
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Lebanese Hezbollah supporters stood under
pouring rain Monday to protest Israel's air assault on the Gaza
Strip, now into its third day.
</P>
<P>
The protesters thronged a huge square and nearby streets in the
militant group's stronghold south of Beirut, carrying
Palestinian, Lebanese and yellow Hezbollah flags and banners
supporting the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The rally was by far the largest protest in the Arab world, where
outrage over Israel's air strikes continued into a third day.
</P>
<P>
The massive rally was called for by Hezbollah leader Hassan
Nasrallah who in a speech on Sunday urged crowds in the Arab and
Islamic world to rise up in support of Gaza and declared Monday a
day of mourning and solidarity with Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowds on Monday through a large screen from an
unknown location, Nasrallah urged Palestinians to unite and
sought to boost morale.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's air force will fail to destroy the will of the
(Palestinian) fighters firing rockets ... and the residents of
(Israeli) settlements 20 and 40 kilometers away from Gaza will
remain either outside their settlements or in shelters," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Death to Israel," and "At your service, Gaza!" many in the crowd
shouted.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah warned Israel that any ground offensive will result in
many losses for the Israelis and said Israel will fail as it did
when it fought Hezbollah guerrillas in a monthlong air and ground
offensive in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming Israeli bombing campaign, the deadliest against
Palestinians in decades, had killed 315 people by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon, around 3,000 people
also staged a demonstration, many of them chanting slogans in
which they insulted the rulers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia
for perceived complicity with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, which has been particularly criticized for joining
Israel in closing its borders with Gaza, thousands of people
rallied, calling for the active intervention of Arab armies to
protect the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were held near the parliament building and in
downtown Cairo amid a massive security presence of black-clad
riot police. Demonstrations in the tourist destination of Luxor,
however, were prevented.
</P>
<P>
The largest protest, a crowd of up to 3,000 people outside the
Journalists' Union, was organized by the opposition Muslim
Brotherhood, and in an unusual move, the Islamist organization's
Supreme Guide Mohammed Mahdi Akef took part, urging the crowd to
make "their declaration of anger through peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
In Iran, a prominent conservative political party announced it is
registering volunteers to fight against Israel in response to the
attacks on Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The party, the Combatant Clergy Society, has provided three
options for the volunteers on its Web site to fight Israel,
including in the military, financial and propaganda fields --
most signing up opted for the military option.
</P>
<P>
The group said Monday it decided to sign up volunteers after
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a religious
decree to world Muslims Sunday, saying anybody getting killed
while defending Palestinians in Gaza would be considered a
martyr.
</P>
<P>
In the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, thousands rallied for a second
day over the Gaza attack. The protesters marched to the Egyptian
embassy calling for an opening of the Egyptian-Gaza border for
supplies and aid to the Palestinians. They also marched to the
U.N. headquarters where they handed over a protest note.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, about 1,000 backers of anti-American Shiite cleric
Muqtada al-Sadr staged a protest in eastern Baghdad. "No, no to
Israel," they shouted as they burned Israeli and American flags.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the political party of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki issued a statement condemning the attacks and calling on
Islamic countries to cut relations with Israel and end all
"secret and public talks" with it.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Abdullah II donated blood to Gaza victims, telling
reporters he was "upset" by the scale of the Israeli offensive in
the coastal strip.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, a mixed group of some 300 Arab and Greek protesters
threw rocks at the Israeli embassy and scuffled with riot police,
in a demonstration organized by the Greek communist party.
</P>
<P>
There were also protests Monday in Berlin, where about 2,000
marched through a central shopping district carrying Palestinian
flags and banners saying Israel must end the Gaza blockade, and
in London, where around 600 protested outside the Israeli
embassy. Both rallies passed peacefully.
