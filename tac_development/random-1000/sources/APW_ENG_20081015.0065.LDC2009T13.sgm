The widow of an H&amp;R Block founder donated $20 million Tuesday
to the University of Kansas Hospital's cancer program, where she
was successfully treated for breast cancer this year.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so lucky and so blessed that I can do this," Annette
Bloch told hospital employees as she announced the gift. "I know
that if my husband were alive, he would be just thrilled that I
am."
</P>
<P>
Bloch said she was trying to pay a debt she and her husband owed
to those who helped them overcome cancer. The new donation is
believed to be the largest individual gift to a hospital in
Kansas or the Kansas City area.
</P>

Richard Bloch, a founder of Kansas City, Missouri-based H&amp;R
Block Inc., the giant tax preparation company, was diagnosed in
1978 with terminal lung cancer but survived until 2004, when he
died of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
Annette Bloch said she hoped the donation would help get the
Kansas Cancer Center designated as a National Cancer Institute.
The cancer center, which is blended with the hospital's cancer
program, would then be able to attract more grants, clinical
trials and research programs.
</P>
<P>
The Blochs established the R.A. Bloch Cancer Foundation in 1980,
helping cancer patients get information and establishing survivor
parks around the nation.
