Czech priests face probe over communist past
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Czech historians are to pore over communist-era secret police
files kept on the country's priests to establish the level of
collaboration by the Church, the Czech theology academy said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"To open up a process of reflection, first and foremost one has
to have an objective point of view on what is hidden in the
archives of the StB (the secret police)," Stanislav Novotny, head
of the academy, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed an agreement between the academy and
the interior ministry to allow access to the files, and a call
for a national enquiry earlier this month from the archbishop of
Prague, Miloslav Vlk.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Vlk has said that he has a list of around 40 priests who
admitted privately to him in years immediately following the fall
of communism in 1989 that they were collaborators.
</P>
<P>
Dark secrets about the role of the Church in communist-era
central and eastern Europe have come in the spotlight in recent
months, most notably in Slovakia -- which together with the Czech
Republic made up the former Czechoslovakia -- and in Poland.
</P>
<P>
In Poland, the newly installed archbishop of Warsaw, Stanislaw
Wielgus, was forced into a dramatic resignation last month after
revelations that he had collaborated with the communist-era
secret police.
