U.S. probe focuses attention on hotel bombings after Cuba ' s
archenemy Posada freed

HAVANA 2007-05-10 22:27:48 UTC

The plastic explosives were smuggled in bottles of White Rain and
Prell shampoo, and in the soles of a pair of black leather boots.
Fixed to Casio digital clocks and 9-volt batteries with black
adhesive tape, they became powerful bombs.
</P>
<P>
Some of them never detonated, and are now on public display in
Havana as part of what Cuba calls a wealth of evidence against
Fidel Castro's archenemy, Luis Posada Carriles, in a string of
1997 bombings targeting Havana hotels.
</P>
<P>
While Cuba cannot try Posada, who walks free in the United States
after being cleared of immigration fraud charges this week by a
Texas judge, a federal court in New Jersey just might.
</P>
<P>
A secret grand jury is meeting in Newark to decide whether to
indict Posada on charges of financing a terrorist operation. FBI
agents visited Havana last year in connection with the probe,
following up on a 1998 trip to the island, according to two U.S.
law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"We've provided American authorities with a lot of information,"
Cuban Lt. Col. Roberto Hernandez Cabellero said. Visiting FBI
agents deposed him during the 1998 trip, and while he said he had
no information on more recent visits, he said U.S. prosecutors
should have what they need.
</P>
<P>
"The American government has the information necessary to charge
Posada," he said.
</P>
<P>
Posada, 79, has never been tried for the string of 1997 hotel
bombings, which killed an Italian tourist, and he has never been
convicted of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73
people. He was acquitted in the plane bombing in Venezuela, then
escaped from prison while awaiting a retrial.
</P>
<P>
He was detained in March 2005 on charges of lying to U.S.
immigration officials, and was awaiting trial in Texas until a
U.S. district judge dropped the charges Tuesday, accusing the
U.S. government of "fraud, deceit and trickery" while trying to
buy time for its criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling thrilled anti-Castro Cubans in Florida, and turned
frustration among Cubans on the island into rage over the
Americans' failure to indict Posada for terrorism. Cuba has
called the U.S. government hypocritical for arresting alleged
terrorists around the world -- and sending some to a naval base
in eastern Cuba -- while letting Posada go free.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution never charged him for being what he is -- a
terrorist," the Communist Party newspaper Granma declared.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers say there's a good chance that Posada will wind up
being tried in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S.) government is working very hard on this. They are
pushing forward on this," said Gilberto M. Garcia, the attorney
for five New Jersey Cuban-Americans he described as potential
witnesses. U.S. prosecutors, he said, are under tremendous
pressure "to get him on something."
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, Posada has dedicated his life to Castro's
downfall. He fled his native Cuba after the 1959 revolution and
trained alongside other exiles for the disastrous 1961 Bay of
Pigs invasion. He went to Venezuela in 1967, became a citizen and
worked in the country's intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Escaping after serving nine years in a Venezuelan prison, he
wound up in El Salvador where he took part in the Iran-Contra
arms operation run by Lt. Col Oliver North before he was arrested
in Panama in 2000. He was convicted of endangering public safety
in connection with a plot to assassinate Castro at a summit, but
was later pardoned.
</P>
<P>
Posada once acknowledged involvement in the Havana hotel bombings
-- telling The New York Times that "we didn't want to hurt
anybody" -- but now denies any link to those attacks or the
jetliner explosion.
</P>
<P>
Although Venezuela still seeks his extradition in the plane
bombing, a U.S. judge ruled he could not be sent there or to Cuba
for fear he could be tortured.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey probe has the most potential to put Posada behind
bars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Follow the Newark grand jury," advised Phil Peters of the
Lexington Institute, a pro-democracy think tank near Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Only one issue remains: whether the U.S. government will treat
Posada as a terrorist rather than merely an illegal immigrant,"
Peters wrote in his blog. "The immigration charges were always a
sideshow."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Justice Department officials won't discuss the secret
proceedings. But in a 2005 affidavit, a Miami-based FBI agent
said the Havana bombings probe turned up records detailing
US$19,000 in wire transfers from New Jersey to Ramon Medina in
Guatemala and El Salvador between 1996 and 1998. Posada has said
he had a Salvadoran passport in that name.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999 Cuban trial of two Salvadorans in the bombings,
prosecutors said Posada organized and financed the attacks,
recruiting the bombers in Central America and paying about
US$4,500 for each mission. Both were given the death penalty, but
were later spared and remain in prison.
</P>
<P>
The latest FBI visit to Cuba sought more evidence against Posada.
Cuban-American members of U.S. Congress were furious when they
learned of the trip last week, complaining to the Justice
Department that any evidence gathered by communist authorities
would be suspect.
</P>
<P>
"By asking a state sponsor of terrorism for 'evidence' regarding
terrorism, the Bush Administration Justice Department
demonstrates a shockingly profound ignorance of the nature of
terrorism, of its origins, and its state sponsors," U.S.
Representatives Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The only 'evidence' that the terrorist regime in Havana could
provide ... would be fabricated evidence."
