KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 2008-11-04 03:12:32 UTC

<P>
A Malaysian parliamentary panel has cleared the government of any
wrongdoing in an aborted deal to buy European military
helicopters, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Public Accounts Committee, composed of government and
opposition lawmakers, said the 1.6 billion ringgit ($454 million)
deal to purchase 12 EC725 helicopters from Eurocopter followed
correct procedures.
</P>
<P>
The committee investigated opposition accusations that the price
was too high and the negotiations did not go through proper
channels -- even though the deal was scrapped last week because
of budget constraints amid the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"According to what we have seen, we were satisfied that all
procedures were up to the standard," committee chairman Azmi
Khalid told The Associated Press. "If there were any wrongdoings,
we would have figured it out. But there was nothing that was
obvious enough."
</P>
<P>
The committee discussed the deal with Defense and Finance
ministry officials after opposition politicians claimed there
were irregularities in the tender process and that the price tag
was too high.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is expected to take over
as prime minister next March, had signed the letter of intent to
purchase the equipment from Eurocopter, the world's largest
helicopter maker, shortly before he handed over the defense
portfolio to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in September.
</P>
<P>
The Eurocopters were meant to replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky
helicopters, renamed Nuri by the Malaysians. But Abdullah
announced last Tuesday that he was suspending the deal because of
the financial crisis. He said the government would use the money
for other public projects.
</P>
<P>
Tian Chua, an opposition lawmaker with the People's Justice
Party, said the inquiry's conclusions did not quell doubts about
the price tag because the panel looked only at procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
"It does not mean that at each step (the government) made the
right decision," he said. "There are still a lot of unanswered
questions."
</P>
<P>
The country's Anti-Corruption Agency is also probing the deal.
