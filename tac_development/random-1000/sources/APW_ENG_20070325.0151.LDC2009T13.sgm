BOSTON 2007-03-25 02:56:55 UTC
</P>
<P>
Thomas Pock scored with 100 seconds left to send the game into
overtime and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 40 shots Saturday as the
New York Rangers rallied to beat Boston 2-1 in a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Michael Nylander and Jaromir Jagr assisted on Pock's goal and
also scored in the shootout as the Rangers swept the season
series against the Bruins for the second consecutive year. New
York has lost just once in regulation in its last 13 games to
hold onto the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference playoff
race.
</P>
<P>
Marc Savard scored for the Bruins in the second period, and that
was the game's only goal until Jagr surprised Boston defenseman
Zdeno Chara in the corner and forced a turnover. Pock picked up
the puck and made a wrist shot from the left circle that got by
Joey MacDonald on the stick side, spoiling the rookie's bid for
his first career shutout.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald stopped 35 shots just a week after he was called in to
relieve Tim Thomas against the Rangers and allowed four goals on
11 shots before Thomas had to come back in to finish the game.
Boston lost that game 7-0 to start a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have lost seven of their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
Islanders 4, Flyers 3
</P>
<P>
At Philadelphia, Andy Hilbert scored the decisive goal for the
Islanders with less than 5 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Hilbert broke a 3-3 tie when he redirected Marc-Andre Bergeron's
backhand pass into the net for his eighth goal at 15:20 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
Richard Park, Randy Robitaille and Jason Blake also scored for
the Islanders, who have won two straight after dropping six of
their previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Carter, Randy Jones and Ben Eager scored for the Flyers, who
have lost four straight.
</P>
<P>
Blues 3, Red Wings 2, SO
</P>
<P>
At Detroit, Doug Weight scored the only goal in the shootout --
with the help of a replay review -- and the Blues got the road
win.
</P>
<P>
Weight's goal was first called a save by Dominik Hasek, but
overturned by a review.
</P>
<P>
Dan Cleary, Detroit's last shooter, was stopped by Jason
Bacashihua. That save also was reviewed, but upheld.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Mojzis scored his first career goal and Brad Boyes also
scored for St. Louis. Bacashihua made 40 saves.
</P>
<P>
Jiri Hudler and Valtteri Filppula got Detroit's goals and Hasek
stopped 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
Penguins 2, Thrashers 1
</P>
<P>
At Pittsburgh, Jordan Staal and Michel Ouellet scored to help the
Penguins get the win.
</P>
<P>
Backup goalie Jocelyn Thibault stopped 25 of 26 shots for the
Pittsburgh, which snapped a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
Scott Mellanby scored for Atlanta, which has lost two in a row.
</P>
<P>
Hurricanes 6, Sharks 4
</P>
<P>
At Raleigh, North Carolina, Cam Ward made the most of his first
start in goal in nearly two weeks and Andrew Ladd scored twice,
helping Carolina beat San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Ray Whitney, Erik Cole, Eric Staal and Cory Stillman also had
goals for the Hurricanes, who improved to 5-1-1 in their past
seven games. Carolina has 84 points and remained tied with the
Montreal Canadiens for the eighth and final position in the
Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Ward missed three games with a laceration on his
leg, then relieved John Grahame in a come-from-behind victory
over Washington on Thursday. Ward, the playoff MVP last year when
the Hurricanes captured the Stanley Cup, has wins in two straight
outings to improve to 29-17-6 in his first full season as a
starter in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
Bill Guerin, Jonathan Cheechoo, Steve Bernier and Joe Thornton
scored for the Sharks, who lost in regulation for the first time
in more than three weeks (8-1-2).
</P>
<P>
Canadiens 4, Capitals 1
</P>
<P>
At Montreal, Alex Kovalev had his first two-goal game of the
season and Jaroslav Halak made 27 saves to win his fourth
straight start to help Montreal defeated Washington.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Plekanec and Michael Ryder also scored for Montreal, which
won its season-high sixth in a row at home. The Canadiens have
won six of seven overall.
</P>
<P>
Halak won for the seventh time in 11 starts since he was called
up from Hamilton of the AHL on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Semin scored his 38th goal for Washington, which ended
an 0-3 road trip. Olaf Kolzig made 36 saves for the Capitals, who
were outshot 40-28.
</P>
<P>
Maple Leafs 4, Sabres 1
</P>
<P>
At Toronto, Darcy Tucker scored twice and Toronto rebounded to
earn a split of a home-and-home series with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
Carlo Colaiacovo and Nik Antropov scored for the Maple Leafs, who
blew a 4-1 third-period lead in Buffalo on Friday. The Maple
Leafs were determined to make up for it, outshooting the Sabres
34-20.
</P>
<P>
Toronto remained in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, two
points and three places behind Carolina and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Jochen Hecht scored for the conference-leading Sabres, who tied a
season-low by scoring just one goal.
</P>
<P>
Senators 7, Lightning 2
</P>
<P>
At Tampa, Florida, Dany Heatley had two goals and an assist to
lead Ottawa past Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
Heatley has 45 goals this season. Joseph Corvo, Daniel
Alfredsson, Christoph Schubert, Patrick Eaves and Dean McAmmond
also scored for Ottawa, which has earned at least a point in 20
of 21 games (15-1-5) since Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
Dan Boyle had two goals for the Lightning, and Vincent Lecavalier
added two assists to become the first Tampa Bay player to reach
100 points in a season.
</P>
<P>
Devils 4, Panthers 3, SO
</P>
<P>
At Sunrise, Florida, Travis Zajac scored the winning goal in a
shootout and New Jersey broke a season-high, three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
Florida's Ville Peltonen and New Jersey's Zach Parise each scored
in the first round of the shootout, but Nathan Horton failed on
the Panthers' chance in the second round. Florida captain Olli
Jokinen then fired wide on his club's final attempt.
</P>
<P>
Jim Dowd broke out of a 4 1/2-month scoring drought with a pair
of goals in regulation for the Devils, who remained two points
ahead of Pittsburgh atop the Atlantic Division. New Jersey goalie
Martin Brodeur matched his career high with 43 wins, a total he
reached three previous times.
</P>
<P>
Wild 4, Kings 1
</P>
<P>
At St. Paul, Minnesota, third-string goalie Josh Harding turned
in another strong performance to help Minnesota stretch its
franchise-best winning streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
Brian Rolston got his team-leading 31st goal after Brent Burns
scored in the first period for Minnesota, which sneaked past idle
Vancouver into first place in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
Mikko Koivu added a late goal for the Wild, who have 97 points --
a franchise record and the fourth-highest total in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Dustin Brown scored for the Kings, who have been eliminated from
the playoff chase, but entered the game having gone 4-1-1 in
their previous six games. Goalie Mathieu Garon had a four-game
winning streak end.
