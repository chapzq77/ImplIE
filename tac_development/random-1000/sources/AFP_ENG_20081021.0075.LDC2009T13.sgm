Football: Win over Fiorentina puts Bayern on the brink
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bayern Munich ignored their poor league form to secure a
convincing 3-0 win over Fiorentina in Tuesday's Champions League
match in Munich to take control of Group F.
</P>
<P>
First-half goals by Germany striker Miroslav Klose and Bastian
Schweinsteiger, as well as a strike by Brazilian Ze Roberto on 90
minutes made the win safe.
</P>
<P>
Despite a dramatic slump in recent weeks which has seen them
crash to 11th in the Bundesliga, Bayern forgot their domestic
league form to take another three points in the quest to add to
their 2001 Champions League crown.
</P>
<P>
The victory will take some of the pressure off Bayern coach
Jurgen Klinsmann who picked up his first win of October last
weekend -- his first in four league games -- as Munich's fortunes
look to be improving.
</P>
<P>
With two wins and a draw under their belt in Group F, Bayern are
now on the verge of making the first knock-out phase with seven
points from Lyon second on five.
</P>
<P>
But the result leaves Fiorentina in a precarious position --
especially after Lyon's 5-3 win at Steaua Bucharest -- at third
in the table.
</P>
<P>
Bayern had a dream start when Luca Toni brushed off a rib injury
to face his former club and flicked the ball into the path of
Miroslav Klose who out-paced the defence to drill the ball into
the corner after just four minutes.
</P>
<P>
Then Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger capitalised on a
mistake in the defence on the edge of the area and smashed his
shot past Fiorentina's French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey on 25
minutes to make it 2-0 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Having scored 31 league goals for La Viola in the 2005/06 season,
Toni is still a firm favourite amongst Fiorentina fans despite
playing for Bayern and received a warm response when he was
replaced on 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
His replacement, Germany striker Lukas Podolski, was soon into
the action and had a chance to score on 61 minutes when French
midfielder Franck Ribery put him into space.
</P>
<P>
But Cesare Prandelli's team will leave Munich disappointed they
did not finish their chances having had some 23 shots on goal,
compared to Bayern's 15, but were constantly frustrated by
Bayern's defence.
</P>
<P>
And on the stroke of 90 minutes Bayern's Ze Roberto unleashed an
unstoppable shot which gave Frey little chance and made sure the
Italians return home empty handed.
</P>
<P>
But with three games left for both teams there is still all to
play for in the return leg on November 5 when the two sides meet
at Fiorentina's Artemio Franchi stadium.
