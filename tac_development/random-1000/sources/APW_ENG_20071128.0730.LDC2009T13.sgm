Top EU trade official says lack of access contributing to
ballooning deficit with China

China's rise as a global trading power obligates it to drop
barriers preventing foreign competition in its domestic market
and contributing to its ballooning trade surplus, the European
Union's top trade official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives
the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter
Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade
surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and
expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year. The
weakness of China's currency, the yuan, against the euro also
makes exports to China more expensive.
</P>
<P>
"This is not because of any lack of competitiveness by Europe,"
Mandelson said. "The EU has a surplus with the rest of the world
where we are allowed to compete freely."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's remarks, while pointed and critical, did not
contain any new proposals or mention any possible EU sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it is necessary to deliver difficult messages on trade
... but they are always constructive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic
concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright
piracy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who spoke after Mandelson, tried to
address some of those points, saying Beijing has put in measures
to expand imports and stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
He also said China was "sincere and ambitious" in its efforts in
protecting intellectual property rights and was giving market
forces more determination over the value of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
"In China's open market, every trading partner is treated
equally," he said, adding that Beijing doesn't seek to have a
trade surplus with its partners.
</P>
<P>
The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic
dialogue in March, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Also in Beijing on Wednesday, the EU's top finance officials
warned that the weak yuan and looming Chinese trade surplus
threatened to spark a backlash in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It could have the result that a protectionist reaction could
occur in Europe," said Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime
minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Juncker, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
traveled to China for talks with Wen and other officials.
Discussions covered currency markets and other economic issues,
although neither side indicated any breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
Juncker, speaking as head of a committee of eurozone finance
ministers known as the Eurogroup, said he and the other members
were befuddled by the euro's continued strength against the yuan,
even as the Chinese currency gains steadily against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less
to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating
vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the
euro," Juncker told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We do think we have to correct this obvious imbalance," Juncker
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel
Barroso, who is leading the EU delegation, met with a rising star
of the Chinese political establishment.
</P>
<P>
Li Keqiang, 54, was recently promoted to the Politburo Standing
Committee -- the nine-member body that is the apex of Chinese
political power. An economist and legal scholar who formerly
headed the industrial province of Liaoning, Li is considered a
possible successor to President Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
"China's relations with the EU date back to the early days of the
European Community," Li said. "This relationship has a history of
decades, and since 1975, this relationship has come a long way."
</P>
<P>
The group also met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who called
the summit "an effective platform for cooperation and exchanges
between the two sides."
