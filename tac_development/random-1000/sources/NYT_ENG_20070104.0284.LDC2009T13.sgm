ISRAELI RAID OVERSHADOWS MEETING BETWEEN OLMERT AND MUBARAK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli-
Palestinian peace negotiations. But the meeting was overshadowed
by an Israeli military raid in the West Bank in which four
Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours
before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea
resort town, Sharm el-Sheik. He called it a hindrance to peace
efforts and told Olmert that Egypt "rejects and is indignant at
the military operation."
</P>
<P>
"Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but
by serious endeavors toward peace," Mubarak added at his news
conference with Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were
hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to
arrest "terrorists who had killed Israelis."
</P>
<P>
He gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a
vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual
force in normally quiet Ramallah. He said Israeli troops returned
fire, but did not initiate it. "Things developed in a way that
could not have been predicted in advance," he said. "If innocent
people were hurt, this was not our intention."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Olmert met
last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it
"proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake."
Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce
with Israel to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of
all efforts aimed at realizing peace," Abbas said.
</P>
<P>
Olmert and Mubarak said Egyptian efforts were continuing to
secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by
Hamas militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian
prisoners. There had been speculation that the two men might be
able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is
blocking more substantive discussions with Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert-
Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit the region this
month.

<P>
It was an unusual and emotional day for Olmert, during which he
commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of
whom he succeeded in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the
city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95
and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved
for Israel's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Olmert defeated Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter
political fight in 1993. He said Israel's first leader, David
Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in
1949, but "Teddy Kollek made it so."
</P>
<P>
Thursday also marked a year since former Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a
deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken. Olmert,
Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead
and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Sharon's tragedy
at his news conference in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In general, Olmert has been regarded as inferior to both Sharon
and Kollek. In the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf
Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot,
nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of
Olmert's performance as prime minister. Israelis are unhappy with
the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him
with the more stolid and experienced Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Still, Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early
on Thursday parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a
crucial test of his government's ability to survive.
</P>
<P>
Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption
scandal. He has not been touched by this scandal, though he has
been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of
influence. But his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has
been placed under house arrest and ordered not to contact Olmert
as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax
Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Zaken's brother and two
other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key
jobs in return for tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading
scandal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored
vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out
hours before Olmert met with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest
Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigades. The army would not confirm that Hamad was the target,
but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but
escaped. The army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it
prompted an angry response. Youths on rooftops threw stones,
metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the
Israeli army vehicles. There were mortars fired at the Israeli
soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23;
Khalil al-Badawi, 20; Jamal Jawela, 29; and Ala al-Himran, in his
20s -- died from gunshot wounds at a Ramallah hospital.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed
in fighting between Fatah and Hamas. The fighting centered around
the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen
surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.
</P>
<P>
In Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib,
was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants
attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades.
Two of his bodyguards were also killed. About 25 others were
wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to
the gunmen to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, five Palestinians, including a woman passer-by,
were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gunbattles, which broke
a weeklong lull. Other militant factions arranged a truce
overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released
by the other sides, but the truce broke down Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, returned
to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi
Arabia. His entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish,
Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash
back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since
Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, Haniya said he and Abbas had agreed at emergency
talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian
photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Razuri, 50, who is
said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to
keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.
</P>
<P>
A leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said
the security chaos could be resolved only with political
agreement. "The weakness of the Palestinian political system and
the situation of the current Hamas-led government have
contributed to this state of lawlessness," he said.
