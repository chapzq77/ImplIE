DNA tests to identify the father of Anna Nicole Smith's infant
daughter may not resolve legal struggles over custody of the
girl, a lawyer for Smith's former partner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Howard K. Stern, who has been caring for 6-month-old Dannielynn
in the Bahamas, was complying with the court ordered tests, but
may not relinquish custody even they prove the father is Smith's
ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead, attorney James Neavitt said.
</P>
<P>
"Howard is the legal father. If Mr. Birkhead's DNA matches, then
he can come and say he's the biological father, and then you'll
have that court battle," Neavitt told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Neavitt did open the possibility of a negotiated settlement if
the test proves his client is not the biological father. He said
Stern respects Birkhead and that the two men will likely reach an
agreement if the Los Angeles-based photographer is proven to be
the father.
</P>
<P>
"At that point, it will be a whole different scenario, and the
two guys will have to work something out," he said by phone from
Los Angeles. "Dannielynn's interests are the most important, and
Howard's been protecting her from the start."
</P>
<P>
A Bahamian judge on Tuesday granted Birkhead's request for a DNA
test on the child, who potentially stands to inherit millions.
</P>
<P>
At the gated, waterfront home where he lived with Smith, Stern
drove away with Dannielynn on Wednesday morning, then returned
later without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
The paternity dispute intensified after Smith, 39, died of still-
undisclosed causes in Florida on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
Frederic von Anhalt, the husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor, also says he
may be Dannielynn's father. Last month, he too filed legal
documents seeking a DNA test.
</P>
<P>
Another contender for custody is Smith's mother Virgie Arthur,
who says she could provide a more stable home than Stern and has
asked the court to name her Dannielynn's guardian. Stern has been
ordered not to leave the island nation with the girl before a
custody ruling.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, could inherit millions
from the estate of Smith's late husband, Texas oil tycoon J.
Howard Marshall II. Smith had been fighting Marshall's family
over his estimated US$500 million (euro380 million) fortune since
his death in 1995.
