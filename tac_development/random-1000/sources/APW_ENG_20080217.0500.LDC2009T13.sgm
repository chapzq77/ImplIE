The Associated Press is changing its datelines for stories from
Kosovo following today's declaration of independence. Stories
from Pristina, for example, will now be datelined PRISTINA,
Kosovo, instead of PRISTINA, Serbia.

<P>
An independent state of Kosovo has yet to receive full
international recognition, and its legal status remains an issue
of controversy for many. However, in light of the decision of its
parliament and government to separate from Serbia, the AP is
using Kosovo as the most understandable geographic name for this
specific region of former Yugoslavia.
