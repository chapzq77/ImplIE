Bernanke sees slow US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that a
recovery from the financial crisis "will not happen right away"
but that the US economy will eventually emerge "with renewed
vigor."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman said
that the problems in the economy and markets "are large and
complex, but in my judgment, our government now has the tools it
needs to confront and solve them."
</P>
<P>
Bernanke said the crisis "has many novel aspects" stemming from
the globalization of markets and quick movements of money and
information but that "the current situation also has much in
common with past experiences."
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman did not use the term recession, as mentioned by
San Francisco Fed president Janet Yellen on Tuesday, but he
suggested the economy would remain weak for some time.
</P>
<P>
The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in
markets and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The massive 700-billion-dollar rescue approved by US lawmakers
and similar measures in other countries will go a long way toward
steadying markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step,
but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic
recovery will not happen right away," Bernanke said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic activity had been decelerating even before the recent
intensification of the crisis. The housing market continues to be
a primary source of weakness in the real economy as well as in
the financial markets, and we have seen marked slowdown in
consumer spending, business investment and the labor market.
Credit markets will take some time to unfreeze."
</P>
<P>
Bernanke added that the overall recovery "will depend greatly on
the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more
normal functioning."
</P>
<P>
Yellen said Tuesday that the US economy was likely to see
"essentially no growth" in the third quarter and that that the
fourth quarter "appears to be weaker yet, with an outright
contraction quite likely."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the US economy appears to be in a recession," Yellen
said.
</P>
<P>
Bernanke meanwhile expressed confidence in the longer-term
outlook once the credit and banking problems are fixed.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that we now have the tools we need to respond
with the necessary force to these challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although much work remains and more difficulties surely lie
ahead, I remain confident that the American economy, with its
great intrinsic vitality and aided by the measures now available,
will emerge from this period with renewed vigor."
