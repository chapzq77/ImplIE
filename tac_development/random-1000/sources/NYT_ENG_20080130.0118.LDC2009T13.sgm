CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. - This is familiar territory for the
Panthers. With 10 weeks left in the season, they're 12th in the
East and need to make up ground to reach the playoffs. It's been
that way for five seasons in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Panthers say they are determined to end their agonizing
playoff drought.
</P>
<P>
But some observers think the Panthers haven't exhibited enough
determination to reach the post-season for the first time since
April 2000. To put it more bluntly, some critics think they are
soft.
</P>
<P>
"This team plays too much on the perimeter; I haven't seen the
willingness to get their noses dirty and do the dirty work," said
NHL broadcaster John Vanbiesbrouck, who starred in the nets for
the Panthers when they reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Winning isn't easy. You've got to make up your mind you're going
to do whatever it takes to get there and play like that every
night."
</P>
<P>
The Panthers have done that only intermittently during the first
51 games. Despite their uneven play - they have won only four of
their past 14 games - they are only three points out of the
Southeast Division lead and five out of eighth place.
</P>
<P>
"It's good that we're still there; I'm more optimistic than years
before," captain Olli Jokinen said. "But there's way too many
'ifs' and 'buts.' Now it's time to go out and do it."
</P>
<P>
That is what NHL Network analyst Gary Green would like to see.
Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack
grittiness."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about having enforcers; it's more banging in the
corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their
opponents," Green said. "They won't make it if they don't find a
way to get that."
</P>
<P>
A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The
Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1
when trailing after the first period.
</P>
<P>
"The games they've won they've had the lead from the first period
on," Panthers announcer Denis Potvin said.
</P>
<P>
"They've got to be winning third periods. You can go into the
third period down by one or two and still win that period. (They)
haven't been winning that period."
</P>
<P>
The Panthers have been outscored 61-47 in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Vanbiesbrouck said he also has been disappointed by the
production of several secondary scorers, most notably Nathan
Horton (12 goals, 26 assists) and Stephen Weiss (9 goals, 20
assists). While they rank second and third on the team in points,
neither has had the breakout year many expected.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score,"
Vanbiesbrouck said.
</P>
<P>
Weiss said: "I want to have more points. It's not for lack of
chances. I just have to bear down in the crease area, make sure
pucks are going in the net."
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have two lines scoring," Potvin said.
</P>
<P>
"One could make the argument that when the Jokinen line was going
the Weiss line was not, or the Weiss line was going and the
Jokinen line wasn't. One line just isn't enough."
</P>
<P>
While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost,
Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
Potvin also said players have to take it upon themselves to stop
being whistled for untimely penalties.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, a hooking call against defenseman Jassen
Cullimore with 2:21 left opened the door for Edmonton's rally in
what proved to be a crushing 4-3 shootout loss.
</P>
<P>
Several players conceded that the team is maddeningly
inconsistent. Early, late, or sometimes in the middle of games, a
loss of focus will prompt a salvo of opposition shots that often
as not overwhelm goalie Tomas Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
"Some games we're slower at the beginning, then pick it up,"
defenseman Ruslan Salei said. "Some we play well from the
beginning. I can't give an answer why."
</P>
<P>
Jokinen also is perplexed.
</P>
<P>
"One night it's there, the next it isn't," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's 31 games now. We have to make up our mind; we really have
to buy into this or we're just going to waste another year."
</P>
<P>
If that happens and Columbus makes the playoffs - the Blue
Jackets returned from the break tied for eighth in the West - the
Panthers would become the only team in the league to fail to
reach the post-season since 2000.
</P>
<P>
That in turn would force majority owner Alan Cohen to face a host
of questions concerning the future of everyone from fourth-liners
to Jokinen to coach and General Manager Jacques Martin.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to play dirty hockey, we've got to play hard every
night, and there's no time for a letdown," forward Radek Dvorak
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to play 60 minutes of hockey."
