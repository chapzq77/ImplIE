A RUSH TO CASH OUT OF NORTHERN ROCK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON
</P>
<P>
Terry Mays and his wife, both British retirees, decided during
the weekend that a promise by the Bank of England to provide
emergency financing for Northern Rock, the troubled British
mortgage lender that has most of their savings, was not
sufficient to calm their nerves.
</P>
<P>
The couple joined hundreds of other Northern Rock customers
Monday as lines formed for a third day in front of branches where
people waited to withdraw their savings.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the bank will collapse -- but we just don't have
the nerves," he said, surrounded by a group of depositors who had
traveled with him to the central London branch from a southern
one after being told that the wait there would be at least six
hours. "I took some financial advice over the weekend, and I'm
taking the money out to get peace of mind. We're relying on this
money for our pension."
</P>
<P>
Panicky customers have withdrawn an estimated 2 billion pounds,
or $4 billion, since the bank acknowledged Friday that it no
longer could raise funds because of the credit crunch that has
squeezed global markets following a meltdown in the market for
subprime loans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other banks that have been bailed out because of direct
exposure to subprime mortgages, Northern Rock was the first to
directly fall victim to the global credit squeeze, because it
relied heavily on raising funds in the capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Northern Rock slumped 33 percent Monday to a seven-year
low, dragging European banking stocks lower across the board as
jittery investors began scrutinizing banks to determine which
ones might have a similar business model.
</P>
<P>
Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, two
Northern Rock rivals that also tap the capital markets for
funding, fell 18 percent and 8 percent respectively Monday. Major
financial institutions, including HSBC Holdings, Societe Generale
of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany also declined, leading a
1.3 percent drop of the European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. The
FTSE 100 in Britain fell 1.2 percent, and the CAC in France fell
1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Northern's woes ricocheted back to the United States, where
Citigroup fell 61 cents, to $46.03. The S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.51
percent.
</P>
<P>
The overnight rate British banks charge to lend pounds to one
another soared 60 basis points to 6.47 percent Monday, the
highest level in more than a month, according to the British
Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch cut their earnings
estimates for several European banks Monday, including Northern
Rock. Credit Suisse and Merrill said the bank was likely to be
bought.
</P>
<P>
"We think the game is over for Northern Rock in its present
form," a Merrill analyst, John-Paul Crutchley, wrote in a note to
investors.
</P>
<P>
The specter of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals
after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also
sparked a raft of questions about whether the robust British
economy -- supported in large part by a heated housing market --"
would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in
the United States. The pound fell below $2 for the first time in
nearly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent
consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British
economic growth. Members of Britain's opposition Conservative
party Monday blamed Prime Minister Gordon Brown for ignoring
warnings of a "looming debt crisis" for the past four years and
for encouraging consumers to take on record debt when he was
chancellor of the Exchequer during this period.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, British mortgage lenders began offering loans
exceeding the value of the properties on which they were based.
The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices
and fueled speculation in the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under
pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only
days after refusing to inject liquidity into cash-starved
financial markets on the basis that such action encouraged
"excessive risk-taking."
</P>
<P>
So far, assurances from the Northern Rock chief executive, Adam
Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair
Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of
England, have failed to impress depositors. In a bid to shore up
confidence, Darling announced Monday that the government would
guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should
collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other
troubled financial institution that approached the government. No
other bank or institution had yet approached the Bank of England,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Some of those waiting in line to retrieve their savings Monday
blamed what they called lax standards at both U.S. and British
mortgage lenders for the shortage of funds at Northern Rock.
</P>
<P>
"We had to go through a lengthy process to get a mortgage that
was barely more than we earned, and now my son's girlfriend can
get double that with hardly any income," said one customer, who
declined to give his name but said he planned to withdraw his
entire savings of more than 100,000 pounds. "That's just not
right."
</P>
<P>
Northern Rock opened at 8 a.m. Monday, one hour earlier than
usual, to deal with the expected wave of withdrawals. It had to
increase the bandwidth on its Web site, which had struggled with
the volume of people trying to access it.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at
a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw
her money after watching the morning news and seeing new lines
forming at the bank branches.
</P>
<P>
"I hate to take out the money, but I just don't want to risk
anything," she said, adding that she did not yet know what she
would do with it.
</P>
<P>
Troubles at Northern Rock filled the top headlines in the British
press, further spreading nervousness. The BBC wrote on its Web
site that clients were besieging branches, while The Evening
Standard said that savers had pushed the bank to the "brink of
extinction."
</P>
<P>
"People are mortified and if savers are continuing to withdraw
funds, a sale or split up becomes more likely," said Christine
Ross, head of financial planning at SG Hambros in London. Large
clearing banks like Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Royal
Bank of Scotland might profit by scooping up former Northern Rock
customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Pierce, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse in London,
said that the most likely scenario for Northern Rock was a sale
to another bank either "as a business or division of assets."
Yet, the difficulties have "severely dented" the brand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some customers, including Mays, wished they had the nerves to
keep some savings with Northern Rock and wait for the bank to be
bought. "There was speculation that whoever buys it could offer
incentives for customers to leave their money in there," Mays
said. "But the thing is, you just don't know."
