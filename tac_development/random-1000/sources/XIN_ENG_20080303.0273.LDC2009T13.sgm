BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Montenegro on Monday joined the European Union (EU)'s
Competitiveness and Innovation Program (CIP), following the
footsteps of three fellow candidate and potential candidate
countries aspiring to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Croatia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia joined the
CIP in October 2007, while Turkey did so in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Under CIP, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm,
promotes innovation, entrepreneurship and growth in small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Gunter Verheugen, responsible for
enterprise and industry policy, said Montenegro's joining the CIP
"confirms its European aspirations."
</P>
<P>
"Participation in CIP, and, in particular the cooperation in the
new Enterprise Europe Network, which Montenegro has already
successfully entered, will help Montenegro to increase the
competitiveness of its enterprises, in particular SMEs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Commission, the possibility of
participating in a host of joint projects and in Enterprise
Europe Network with the 27 EU member states is a substantial
advantage for Montenegro. It will allow the country to take full
benefit of best practices on entrepreneurship, SMEs policy,
competitiveness and innovation in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the Montenegrin economy is formed by the large
and expanding sector of small companies. The groundwork on
developing a favorable regulatory framework for SMEs has been
almost completed through Montenegro's participation, since 2003,
in the European Charter for Small Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Verheugen and Montenegro's Minister for Economic
Development Branimir Gvozdenovic also signed a Memorandum of
Understanding formalizing the Montenegro's entry to the
Entrepreneurship and Innovation pillar of CIP.
</P>
<P>
The CIP, which runs from 2007 to 2013 with a budget of 3.6
billion euros (some 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), contains the
following three pillars.
</P>
<P>
-- Entrepreneurship and Innovation Framework Program (EIP): EIP
fosters the competitiveness of enterprises for example by
providing co-guarantees and co- investments for local banks and
risk capital funds so that they can improve access for SMEs to
loan and venture capital finance. EIP also supports providers of
business and innovation services in all EU regions or helps to
link innovation actors and clusters in European networks.
</P>
<P>
-- Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support
Program (ICTPSP): ICTPSP accelerates the development of a
sustainable, competitive, innovative and inclusive information
society stimulating a wider adoption and more efficient take up
and better use of information and communication technologies.
</P>
<P>
-- Intelligent Energy-Europe Program (IEE): IEE promotes energy
efficiency and new and renewable energy sources in all sectors
including transport.
