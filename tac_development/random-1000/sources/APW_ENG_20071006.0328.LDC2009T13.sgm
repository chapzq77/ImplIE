Unofficial results showed Pakistan's Gen. Pervez Musharraf
sweeping Saturday's presidential election, but the Supreme Court
could still disqualify the military leader.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Qazi Muhammad Farooq announced that
Musharraf had won 252 of the 257 votes cast in Parliament, with
three ballots judged invalid and two votes going to his main
rival, retired judge Wajihuddin Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Television reported unofficial results that Musharraf
had also swept the voting in three of Pakistan's four provinces.
Vote counting had yet to start in the fourth province of Sindh.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the official results can only
be declared after it rules on petitions lodged by Musharraf's
opponents that his candidacy is unconstitutional.
