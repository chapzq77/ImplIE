NEW YORK, Oct. 3 (Xinhua)

<P>
U.S. stocks retreated Friday as investors worried about the
outlook of economy despite the U.S. government's 700-billion-
dollar financial rescue plan.

<P>
The major indexes rallied Friday morning as the markets believed
the House would approve the rescue plan and the Federal Reserve
could cut interest rate to boost the weak economy.

The monthly jobs report released earlier in the day suggested the
economy may be in a recession. U.S. employers cut 159,000 jobs in
September, the 9th straight monthly reduction and the steepest
decline in five and a half years.

Stocks fell after the House vote as investors moved their focus
on the tough economic road still ahead and on how the bill will
be implemented.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 157.15 points, or 1.50
percent, to 10,325.70, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index
slid 15.04 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,099.24. The Nasdaq
Composite Index was down 29.33 points, or 1.48 percent, at
1,947.39.
