Schwarzenegger vows investigation, suspends fishing in areas
affected by SF Bay oil spill

SAN FRANCISCO 2007-11-13 22:19:16 UTC
</P>
<P>
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday suspended all fishing in
areas affected by last week's San Francisco Bay oil spill,
calling what was the area's worst spill in nearly two decades an
"unbelievable human failure" and promising an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill
had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's
scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for
Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said
Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State
Association of Counties annual meeting. "Then on top of it, it
takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next
day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its
hull. The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the
presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on
the scene for nearly 90 minutes. A Coast Guard places a skimming
vessel at the scene within 80 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the
Coast Guard's response to the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly
and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent
those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said. "Believe me, we
will ask the tough questions that need to be asked."
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials defended their response as "by the book,"
but concede mistakes in their communication with the public.
Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters);
the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000
gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Schwarzenegger signed an executive order that will
suspend commercial and sport fishing until Dec. 1, or until state
health officials decide it is safe. Governor's spokesman Jeff
Macedo said the state Department of Fish and Game will determine
which fishing areas will be affected by the order.
</P>
<P>
Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean
and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing
boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of
Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas
will be closed to fishing.
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health
to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood
caught in areas impacted by the spill.
</P>
<P>
The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a
sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants
and slow to break down. It is an ecological nightmare for the
water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban
its use.
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Craig Bone, the top Coast Guard officer in California,
said Monday that the owners and operators of the ship will
unquestionably face civil penalties, and that criminal counts
were a possibility. The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by
Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not
immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the
leak.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on
problems involving management and communication between the
officers on the ship's bridge at the time. Among other things,
the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's
experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Darrell Wilson, a representative for Regal Stone, said the
company was eager to hear the results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward
and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement
officials," Wilson said. "We take our job of environmental
stewardship very seriously."
