Bosnian Serb government apologises for war crimes by Tanja
Subotic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb government apologised Wednesday to Muslim and
Croat victims of atrocities during the country's brutal inter-
ethnic war in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The apology came two days after the UN's top court, the
International Court of Justice (ICJ), found Serbia guilty of
failing to prevent genocide by Bosnian Serb forces during the
Srebrenica massacre.
</P>
<P>
The government of Bosnia's Serb-run half, Republika Srpska,
"expresses its deepest regret for the war crimes committed
against non-Serbs during the war in Bosnia," it said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It also called on Muslim and Croat leaders to "do the same in
order to ensure a better future for all peoples and citizens of
Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Republika Srpska would continue to "make maximum
efforts to apprehend remaining people responsible for these
crimes, notably for the crimes committed in Srebrenica," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat government was yet to comment on the
apology.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling on Monday, The Hague-based UN court cleared Serbia
of direct involvement in genocide during Bosnia's war, but said
Belgrade had breached international law over the 1995 slaughter
at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Bosnian town, then a United Nations-protected
enclave, was overrun by Serb forces who summarily killed around
8,000 Muslim males within a few days in the final months of the
war.
</P>
<P>
The massacre is the single worst atrocity in post-war Europe.
</P>
<P>
Its main culprits, wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
and his army chief Ratko Mladic, remain at large. Mladic is
widely believed to be hiding in Serbia and Karadzic in Montenegro
or Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb leaders had for years refused to acknowledge the
extent of the Srebrenica massacre.
</P>
<P>
But under heavy international pressure in 2004, they admitted in
a report their forces murdered Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica
and that the perpetrators had tried to cover up the atrocity and
its scale.
</P>
<P>
Following the report, then Bosnian Serb president Dragan Cavic
expressed regret and called Srebrenica a "black page" in his
people's history.
</P>
<P>
A year later the government commission that produced the report
handed Bosnia's state court a list of names of some 20,000 Serb
soldiers and police deployed in the Srebrenica area at the time
of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
In July 2005, Serbian President Boris Tadic attended a ceremony
marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre in Srebrenica to pay
his respects to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Tadic welcomed Monday's ICJ ruling that exonerated Serbia of
direct charges of genocide, but urged fellow politicians and
citizens to face up to the Srebrenica massacre.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that the Serbian parliament, as soon as possible,
passes a declaration condemning the crime in Srebrenica without
any doubt," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, a motion to adopt such an apology failed in the Serbian
parliament because parties could not agree whether it should
single out Srebrenica or include crimes committed by all sides,
as demanded by nationalists.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war split
the country into two semi-autonomous entities -- Republika Srpska
and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
