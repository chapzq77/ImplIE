French banking system is 'healthy': government spokesman
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The French banking system is "healthy" and well able to avoid
"chain-reaction failures," the French government spokesman Luc
Chatel said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have the good fortune in France of having a banking system
which is healthy and averts these chain reactions," he said,
reporting on a meeting of the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is the world financial system which is showing all its limits
through this crisis."
</P>
<P>
France currently holds the presidency of the European Union and
ministerial meetings.
</P>
<P>
Chatel was speaking after two days of chronic crisis on global
financial markets marked by the collapse of US bank Lehman
Brothers on Monday and the rescue of the AIG insurance giant by
the US authorities overnight.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of the government... is first to avert chain
reactions and to protect customers," and "to lead talks between
European partners... so that action is concerted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It must be said clearly that this is a very big crisis, it is
undoubtedly the first global financial crisis, it must not be
under-estimated," said Chatel, who is also junior industry
minister.
</P>
<P>
"When some banking establishments or some credit establishments
have committed mistakes, when they have been imprudent, it is not
abnormal that one day they pay for the consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on French
24 television: "We are seeing a transformation of financial
markets, of the role of people in finance and of bodies
overseeing finance."
