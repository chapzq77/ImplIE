STARBUCKS PLANS RETURN TO ITS ROOTS

SEATTLE
</P>
<P>
Howard D. Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced
sweeping changes on Wednesday for the company as it seeks to
reconnect with customers who have left for competitors or pared
back their coffee budget in hard economic times.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are intended to restore an authentic coffeehouse
experience to the company's stores and, in turn, re-energize an
ailing stock that has lost half its value in the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the
company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz
introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds
coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow
customers to see baristas making their beverage. He said the
company would roll out the Swiss-made Mastrena machines to three-
fourths of Starbucks stores by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment
Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee
machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one
cup at a time. The price was not disclosed. Starbucks will roll
out Clover systems in select markets.
</P>
<P>
Schultz described a host of other plans: a pungent new coffee
blend, a partnership with Conservation International to certify
environmentally responsible whole-bean espresso products, and a
rewards program for users of the Starbucks customer card.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in mid-April, users of the customer card will be able
to customize their drinks -- with soy milk or vanilla, for
example -- at no cost.
</P>
<P>
The announcements are intended to help Starbucks hang on to
customers in the face of intensifying competition for brewed
coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, which is widely
introducing espresso beverages this year.
</P>
<P>
"This was more of a position statement. They are going back to
their core," said Sharon Zackfia, a securities analyst with
William Blair &amp;amp; Co. "They are saying, 'We are not going
to change who we are, we are going to defend turf aggressively."'
</P>
<P>
Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an
afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters. "A lot of
people are making unique claims about coffee and what they do,"
he said. "What's interesting to me is that they are not coffee
roasters."
</P>
<P>
But Schultz tried largely to keep the focus on the company's
internal challenges and future moves. "This is the first time the
U.S. business is under pressure. It's a character test," he said.
"But it's not about the economy. We don't want to use that as an
excuse. And it's not about the competition. Don't believe the
media hype. There's no coffee war going on. This is about us.
</P>
<P>
"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship,
creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity
and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent
economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in
the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an
economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily
dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
</P>
<P>
Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the
rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard
by the subprime mortgage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for
coffee and dairy products. In the face of those pressures,
Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago. He quickly
announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least
profitable Starbucks stores in the United States. He also said
Starbucks would stop selling a line of breakfast sandwiches that
were served warm, creating an aroma that overwhelmed that of the
coffee in stores.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the
company's early devotion to high-quality coffee. The new coffee
blend, called Pike Place Roast, is a reference to the location of
the first Starbucks store. Starbucks will introduce the blend in
stores next month. Baristas will be directed to brew smaller
batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30
minutes. Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as
two hours.
</P>
<P>
Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people
who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black
because of the sweetness."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community,
mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will
contribute to a corporate blog. Customers will also be encouraged
to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with
employees. The site opens Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to
introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy
beverages later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a
striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at
Starbucks. In the first half of the decade, the company thrived
on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee
drink. The last innovation widely thought to be successful was
the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
</P>
<P>
Schultz partly has his own relentless ambition to blame for the
woes at Starbucks. In the last two years, citing ever-larger
expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more
than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity
to one another and to competing coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores
and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and
employees. The company then tried to create efficiencies among
stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso
machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old
hand-operated machines.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a
significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event
as early as 6 a.m. As a barbershop quartet sang and employees
dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many
shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm. Starbucks is his heart,"
said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was
there with her husband, Bill. "I have every confidence he will
turn the company around so this stock can take our family on our
50th wedding anniversary trip next year."
