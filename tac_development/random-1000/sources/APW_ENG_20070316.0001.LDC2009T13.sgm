Charged U.S. Marine sergeant says Haditha killings were justified
</HEADLINE>

CAMP PENDLETON, California 2007-03-16 00:00:07 UTC

<P>
A Marine staff sergeant charged with unpremeditated murder in the
killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha admitted firing at five
unarmed Iraqi men but said in an interview that their killing was
justified.
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, 26, spoke publicly for the first
time about the events of Nov. 19, 2005, in an interview with the
CBS' "60 Minutes," scheduled for broadcast Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he
had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where
a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's
squad. He said they tried to run from the car, instead of obeying
an order not to.
</P>
<P>
"Normally the Iraqis know the drill. If something happens, get
down, hands up," Wuterich told CBS. "They started to take off, so
I shot at them."
</P>
<P>
The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The
Washington Post. In January, the newspaper ran a story that said
witnesses told investigators that the men did not run away and
Wuterich shot them as they stood, unarmed, by the taxi about 10
feet (3 meters) in front of him.
</P>
<P>
CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the interview was filmed in late
October somewhere near Camp Pendleton, Wuterich's home base.
Wuterich was charged in December with 13 counts of unpremeditated
murder.
</P>
<P>
Three other squad members also were charged with unpremeditated
murder and four officers were charged with failing to properly
investigate or report the killings.
</P>
<P>
Tedesco said it is not unusual for a "60 Minutes" story to take
months to report before it is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich's attorney Neal Puckett did not comment on the CBS
interview and declined an Associated Press request to speak to
Wuterich.
</P>
<P>
Following the taxi shooting, Wuterich said, he was given
permission from a superior officer to raid a house suspected to
have a sniper inside. The Marines did this using grenades and
gunfire, according the CBS News release.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich said he knew women and children were killed in that
house, but he didn't stop the assault because he saw an open
doorway leading toward a second house and believed the sniper had
escaped through it.
</P>
<P>
"My responsibility as a squad leader is to make sure that none of
the rest of my guys died," Wuterich told CBS.
</P>
<P>
Wuterich said he was sorry women and children died, but he
believes he was acting according to how he had been trained.
</P>
<P>
"Did we know that civilians were in there? No," Wuterich told
CBS. "We cleared these houses the way they were supposed to be
cleared."
</P>
<P>
The Marine sergeant said he regretted the deaths.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that I can possibly say to make up or make well
the deaths of those women and children, and I am absolutely sorry
it happened that day," Wuterich told CBS. "What I did that day,
the decision that I made, I would make those decisions again
today. Those are decisions that I made in a combat situation and
I believe I had to make those decisions."
