Pardoned British 'teddy' teacher arrives home from Sudan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A British teacher jailed in Sudan for insulting Islam by naming a
teddy bear Mohammed voiced relief at her release Tuesday, as she
arrived back home after a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just an ordinary middle-aged primary school teacher. I went
out there to have an adventure and got a lot more adventure than
what I was looking for," Gillian Gibbons joked soon after
touching down at London's Heathrow airport.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old left Khartoum Monday evening and arrived in
Britain on an overnight flight from Dubai, accompanied by two
British Muslim members of the House of Lords who helped secure
her pardon by Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir.
</P>
<P>
The teacher, who was smiling but looked visibly tired, said she
had been unaware of the media attention the case had generated,
but had been horrified at the furore her innocent actions caused.
</P>
<P>
"I was very upset to think that I may have caused offence to
people, very, very upset about it," she told an impromptu news
conference at a VIP lounge in the airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke to her by telephone soon after
her arrival, his office said.
</P>
<P>
But despite her incarceration, which she described as
"terrifying", Gibbons said she bore no ill-will towards Sudan or
its people -- and was sad to be leaving her class and colleagues
so soon after arriving.
</P>
<P>
"It has been an ordeal but I was well treated in prison and
everyone was very kind to me," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I am very sorry to leave Sudan. I had a fabulous time. It is a
beautiful place and I had a chance to see some of the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
"The Sudanese people I found to be extremely kind and generous
and until this happened I only had a good experience."
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like to put anyone off going to Sudan," she
continued, thanking Nazir Ahmed and Sayeeda Warsi, the two Muslim
peers, and everyone else who helped secure her release.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons was reunited with her son John and daughter Jessica at
the airport, as friends and former colleagues from her home city
of Liverpool, north-west England, expressed their delight at her
return.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what she will do next, she said: "I'm looking for a
job because I'm jobless. My immediate plan is to spend Christmas
with my family then seriously looking for employment."
</P>
<P>
As Gibbons and her family were taken off to an undisclosed
location, a spokeswoman for Brown said of their conversation: "He
said that he was pleased that she had returned to the UK and
wished her well.
</P>
<P>
"He also made clear that the government stood ready to provide
whatever further assistance may be required."
