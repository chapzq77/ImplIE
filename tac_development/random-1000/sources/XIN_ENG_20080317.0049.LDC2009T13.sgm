2nd Ld, Writethru: Japanese government nominates Tanami as new
BOJ chief

TOKYO, March 18 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government on Tuesday nominated Koji Tanami,
governor of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, as the
new governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Tanami, who previously served as vice finance
minister between January 1998 and July 1999, came after the
opposition-controlled upper house of parliament rejected the
government's initial proposal last week.
</P>
<P>
During the Diet meeting, the government also named former
University of Tokyo professor Kiyohiko Nishimura, who is
currently on the BOJ's Policy Board, as one of the two deputy
governors of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura
expressed his confidence that the proposal will be accepted by
the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Japan's key opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
But Kenji Yamaoka, Diet affairs chief of the DPJ, told reporters
that his party found it "quite difficult" to give consent to the
fresh nomination of Tanami as the new BOJ Chief.
</P>
<P>
The five-year tenure of the current BOJ governor, Toshihiko
Fukui, and his two deputies expires Wednesday.
