ETA blamed as small bomb goes off on Spanish beach
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A small bomb exploded on a beach in the popular southern Spanish
resort town of Torremolinos early Tuesday in an attack blamed on
the Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
No-one was injured by the device which went off without warning.
</P>
<P>
"This was an ETA bomb," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba
told a news conference, adding he did not think this meant the
outfit had a "stable structure" in the southern Andalucia region
which is popular with sunseekers.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened just after midnight (2200 GMT Monday) on a
crowded seafront close to the Aloha Puerto hotel, a police
spokesman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Cadena Ser radio said the device contained one kilogram (about
two pounds) of explosives.
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of dust," the owner of a beachfront restaurant
located near the site of the blast, Rafael Sanchez, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"People started to scream. There were people who were left dizzy
or crying and mothers who removed their children from the area,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
ETA regularly targets Spain's key tourism industry with small
explosions at resorts during the summer holiday season as part of
its 40-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland which has
so far killed 823 people.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the second-most visited country in the world after
France and the tourism sector is a major source of employment.
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear attempt at causing alarm and trying to disrupt the
tourist interests of Andalucia," said Torremolinos mayor Pedro
Fernandez Montes.
</P>
<P>
The explosion follows the arrest last week of several members of
ETA's most active cell which the government blames for most of
the attacks carried out by the outfit since it called off its
ceasefire in June 2007.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorism judge Baltasar Garzon on Sunday ordered the
preventative detention of seven people on charges of belonging to
the cell, including its suspected leader Arkaitz Goikoetxea who
was found to have maps of Andalucia.
</P>
<P>
A scrap merchant found a bag in Torremolinos containing a
handgun, ammunition, detonators and a false military identity
document, public radio RNE reported.
</P>
<P>
The pistol was of the same model as one found to be in
Goikoetxea's possession at the time of his arrest, it added.
</P>
<P>
Four small bombs went off on July 20 at two popular seaside
resorts in northern Spain, Laredo and Noja, following a warning
call from ETA.
</P>
<P>
A woman was slightly injured after being struck by a rock that
was sent flying by one of the blasts while another woman who is
pregnant was treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
A small bomb went off in the early hours of Monday at a highway
building site near the Basque town of Orio in another attack
blamed on ETA.
</P>
<P>
The blast damaged four vehicles and six shacks, a Basque interior
ministry spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
ETA declared a "permanent" ceasefire in March 2006, raising hopes
for an end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
But an ETA bombing at Madrid's airport in December 2006 that
killed two men put an end to tentative peace talks with the
government and in June 2007 the outfit formally called off its
ceasefire.
