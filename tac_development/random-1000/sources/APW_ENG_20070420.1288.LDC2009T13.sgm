Euro finance ministers agree to step up public debt cuts

<P>
Finance ministers from the 13 nations that use the euro agreed
Friday to use the tax windfalls they are currently enjoying to
cut debt and make other changes that the EU says are needed to
deal with the costs of their aging populations.
</P>
<P>
EU ministers are meeting for two-day talks as the euro hovers
near its record high against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen and
on Saturday will discuss new ways to combat tax fraud and deal
with hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
As Europe revels in its fastest growth spurt this decade, EU
officials are urging euro nations to cut their budget deficits.
Italy, Greece and Portugal are still running deficits above the 3
percent level set by rules designed to keep the shared currency
stable.
</P>
<P>
The countries with higher-than-recommended debt are expected to
reduce their budget deficits by at least 0.5 percent of gross
domestic product a year, the euro nations said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This would see most of them reach a medium-term goal of putting
their finances on track in 2008 or 2009 -- with 2010 set as the
ultimate deadline.
</P>
<P>
"They are committed to make full use of the current economic
growth and the better-than-expected tax revenues to pursue sound
fiscal policies," the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
Reducing debt more quickly is not required, but EU officials
stressed that nations know they must try to avoid past mistakes
that saw the euro-zone's two largest economies, Germany and
France, repeatedly break the rules with deficits that were too
high.
</P>
<P>
The euro's high value could be a worry because it makes European
exports more expensive to customers in the United States and
competing unfavorably with Japanese rivals benefiting from the
weak yen.
</P>
<P>
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said he had
heard assurances from both the United States and Japan that they
did not want to see their currencies at such lows.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted with interest that the secretary of the Treasury
and the U.S. authorities have confirmed that a strong dollar was
in the interest of the U.S. economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's finance minister and head of the Central Bank told the
G-7 meeting in Washington last week that the Japanese exchange
rates should reflect the fact that the nation's economy is
recovering.
</P>
<P>
But Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos did not see problems on the
horizon, saying no one in his export-driven economy -- growing
strongly -- had sounded any warnings.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had anybody knocking on my door complaining about the
euro rate," he told reporters. "The development of the rate has
come so gradually to the level where it is now that it hasn't
really shocked anybody or the market."
</P>
<P>
The euro rose to a two-year high Wednesday but stopped short of
hitting its record, even as the British pound reached a 26-year
high after breaking the US$2 mark this week.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 27 finance ministers settle down to informal talks later
Friday, covering a lot of ground by swapping views on what they
can do to cut unemployment -- currently at its lowest level in 15
years even though it is nearly twice the U.S rate. They will look
at increasing training programs to encourage people to find new
jobs as manufacturers move to lower-wage locations elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
They will also talk about their own experiences in reforming tax
systems as some try to boost jobs by cutting labor taxes.
</P>
<P>
Talks continue Saturday covering ways countries can deal with
sales tax fraud and a debate on a German initiative for greater
monitoring of hedge funds.
