Benazir Bhutto assassinated in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Former Pakistan premier Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in a
stunning suicide attack Thursday that plunged the Muslim nation
deeper into crisis and sparked alarm around the world.
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks before general elections, a suicide bomber
pierced her security cordon to shoot her in the neck as she left
a campaign rally. He then blew himself up, killing at least 20
people, police and party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The powerful blast tore off limbs and shredded clothes. Many
people ran in panic, screaming as they trampled over pieces of
human flesh. Puddles of blood dotted the road.
</P>
<P>
"There was an enormous explosion, and then I saw body parts
flying through the air," said Mirza Fahin, a professor at a local
college.
</P>
<P>
"When the dust cleared, I saw mutilated bodies lying in blood. I
have never seen anything so horrible in my life -- just parts of
human beings, flesh, lying in the road."
</P>
<P>
The slaying horrified world leaders who appealed for calm and
warned that extremists must not be allowed to destabilise the
nuclear-armed nation before the January 8 vote.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush called it a "cowardly act" and
telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf -- a
crucial ally in the US-led "war on terror" against Islamic
extremism -- to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Unrest broke out across Pakistan as mobs of protesters torched
buildings, trucks and shops, blocked roads and uprooted rail
tracks. Two people were shot dead in rioting in the eastern city
of Lahore and another two were killed in southern Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Police and paramilitary forces were put on the highest "red
alert" level.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf, who announced three days of national mourning, urged
people to remain peaceful "so that the evil designs of terrorists
can be defeated."
</P>
<P>
But the attack raises questions about whether the election can go
ahead, as well as speculation that Musharraf may re-impose the
emergency rule he ended earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, another former premier and Bhutto's biggest
political rival, said he would boycott the election and urged
Musharraf to resign to "save" the country.
</P>
<P>
"I demand that Musharraf quit power, without delay of a single
day, to save Pakistan," he told reporters, calling for a
nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing,
but Bhutto had previously accused elements in the intelligence
services of trying to kill her and said she had also received
death threats from Islamic militant groups including Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
"The attacker fired and then blew himself up," said one police
official who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
"She was waving to the crowd from the sunroof of her car and then
there was a blast," Bhutto spokesman Farhatullah Babar told state
television.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, 54, became the first ever female prime minister of a
Muslim nation when she took the helm in 1988 for the first of her
two premierships.
</P>
<P>
Her father, also a prime minister, was hanged by the military in
1979 after being ousted from power.
</P>
<P>
Educated at Oxford and Harvard, Bhutto's return here in October
after eight years of self-exile brought hopes of a power-sharing
deal with Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
That optimism was quickly shattered.
</P>
<P>
Her welcome home parade was hit in the deadliest terror attack in
Pakistani history, killing 139 people, while her talks with
Musharraf ended in acrimony after he declared emergency rule on
November 3.
</P>
<P>
As Bhutto's husband Asif Zardari flew in from Dubai, sources said
that her funeral was likely to take place Friday in Larkana, her
home town deep in the rural south.
</P>
<P>
There were frenzied scenes as hundreds of people mobbed her
simple wooden coffin as it was borne uneasily out of the hospital
to a waiting ambulance for the journey to the airport.
</P>
<P>
It had a piece of clear plastic or glass in the lid that allowed
people to see her body, wrapped in a white shroud.
</P>
<P>
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Bhutto's party
successor and Zardari by telephone to press US support for the
elections to go ahead, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
</P>
<P>
World leaders swiftly condemned what neighbour India called an
"abominable act."
</P>
<P>
"The US strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous
extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy,"
Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon described it as a "heinous
crime," and the UN Security Council condemned the "terrorist
suicide attack" after meeting in emergency session to discuss the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Britain called for Pakistanis to show restraint and unity.
</P>
<P>
But unrest broke out in Karachi, Bhutto's stronghold, where
demonstrators torched scores of vehicles and blocked key roads;
in Peshawar in the northwest where police used tear gas and
batons to break up crowds; and in the central city of Multan.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters fired into the air, while others shouted slogans
including "Musharraf is a dog." Violence broke out in other towns
including Jacobabad in the south, where shops belonging to
relatives of interim premier Mohammedmian Soomro were set alight.
