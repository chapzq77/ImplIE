EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip 2007-12-02 16:54:35 UTC
</P>
<P>
Israel let 199 Palestinians out of the blockaded Gaza Strip on
Sunday, and an Israeli official said more would be allowed to
leave for their countries of residence later this week.
</P>
<P>
Five busloads of Palestinians entered Israeli territory and then
crossed into Egypt through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, said
Shadi Yassin, a spokesman for the Israeli civil administration.
About 50 others who were expected to pass today are now scheduled
to be released tomorrow, Yassin said. Israeli security forces
prevented two others from leaving Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to continue to get as many people as possible out of
Gaza over the next few days," Yassin said. "This is the first
time ever that people have been crossed through Kerem Shalom," a
crossing where the borders of Gaza, Egypt and Israel meet.
</P>
<P>
Israel has kept Gaza's border crossings closed since June, when
the Islamic militant Hamas seized control of the territory. The
closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study
abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a
time.
</P>
<P>
The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza
into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked
the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
</P>
<P>
One of the protesters, Salman Fawaz, 55, said he worked as a
construction worker in Saudi Arabia and had been home for a visit
when Hamas seized control and the borders closed. His work visa
in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't
make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of
those allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
Fawaz blamed Gaza's Hamas leadership and its rival, the moderate
government of President Mahmoud Abbas, which rules the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Both are responsible for our suffering," Fawaz said.
</P>
<P>
The protest ended when Palestinian border officials promised that
all of the about 5,000 Gazans still waiting to leave would be
allowed out within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to learn that 250 people were (allowed to cross),
but this is very minor number of people compared to the general
population," said Noga Eitan, spokeswoman for the Gisha Legal
Center for Freedom of Movement, an Israeli human rights group.
"It's possible to have an effective, efficient mechanism that
will get the human beings of Gaza and out of the enormous jail
they are in."
