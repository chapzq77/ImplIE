<P>
British police have arrested a suspect in connection with a
series of recent letter bomb attacks which injured eight people,
they said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The man was held in Cambridge, eastern England, following attacks
dating back to January, many of which targeted motoring-related
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The spate of seven letter bombings took place over a three-week
period ending about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Six of the seven targeted companies provide services or
technology to law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
Media speculation about the identity of the bomber has focused on
a disgruntled motorist or animal rights extremists.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, police eliminated from their enquiries a man
who telephoned a BBC radio show and claimed responsibility for
one of the attacks.
