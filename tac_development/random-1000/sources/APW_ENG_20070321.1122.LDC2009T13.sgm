Media reports: Israeli finance minister may have pocketed missing
funds

JERUSALEM 2007-03-21 17:05:02 UTC

<P>
Israel's finance minister, questioned by police for more than
seven hours in an embezzlement case, is suspected of having
siphoned off some of the missing funds to pay a son's gambling
debts, Israeli media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports mentioned the minister, Avraham Hirchson, receiving
envelopes stuffed with cash in amounts reaching millions of
shekels, but the reports offered no proof. Hirchson is allegedly
implicated in an embezzlement case from a previous job.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media have reported that Hirchson is suspected of not
reporting the 2003 embezzlement of around $1 million
(euro750,000) by a staffer.
</P>
<P>
Hirchson was interrogated at length on Tuesday. Micky Rosenfeld,
an Israeli police spokesman, said police will call Hirchson back
in for more questioning "based on the statements and evidence."
</P>
<P>
Some are calling for Hirchson to step down, at least until the
investigation is over.
</P>
<P>
"On the assumption that the good of the economy is important to
the finance minister ... he would do well to hand over the
finance ministry in trust to another minister, pending the
conclusion of the investigation," wrote Yehuda Sharoni, a
business reporter for the Maariv daily.
</P>
<P>
The minister's spokesman, Ido Hartuv, refused to answer questions
about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hirchson is just the latest Israeli leader to be investigated
over allegations ranging from fraud to rape.
</P>
<P>
Hirchson is a longtime associate of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert,
who is facing accusations about his role in the sale of one of
Israel's largest banks. Olmert has repeatedly been accused of
corruption through his long political career, but has never been
convicted.
</P>
<P>
President Moshe Katsav could be indicted on charges of rape and
other serious offenses, and former Justice Minister Haim Ramon
was forced to resign and later convicted for forcibly kissing a
young woman soldier.
</P>
<P>
Also, a minister-designate, Esterina Tartman, was forced to
withdraw her candidacy last month after key parts of her official
resume turned out to be false.
