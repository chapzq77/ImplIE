PHOENIX  More parties. More celebrities. More media. More
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl beast gets bigger every year.
</P>
<P>
Sure, when the game came to Tampa in 2001, it brought along an
impressive menu of party options and a constellation of Hollywood
faces for stargazers.
</P>
<P>
But when it returns in 2009, expect an avalanche of both driven
in part by new media options, ranging from the NFL Network to
original programming for mobile devices, and more public events
hosted by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
Bill Smith, chairman of the Phoenix Convention Bureau, said the
hoopla surrounding this year's Super Bowl has been light years
beyond what he saw in 1996, the last time Arizona hosted the
game.
</P>
<P>
"This is so different from before," he said. "Massively."
</P>
<P>
This year, the traditional Nike, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Maxim
and Playboy parties were on tap, with access limited to VIPs and
those with plenty of disposable income. But John Travolta, Sean
"Diddy" Combs, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg  to name a few  also lent
their names to events, some with tickets available for as little
as $15, and others going for more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
Common folk could buy tickets to the Pepsi Smash Super Bowl
concert series, which is broadcast on VH1. Last year, before the
Super Bowl in Miami, the concerts featured Fergie and John
Legend. This year it was Mary J. Blige and Maroon 5, with tickets
available for less than $50.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the NFL this year hosted Super Bowl Saturday
Night, which includes a free concert by the Counting Crows and a
fireworks show.
</P>
<P>
Krista Soroka, director of events and hospitality for the Tampa
Bay Super Bowl Host Committee, said she spoke to the NFL about
possible locations for a similar event in the bay area next year.
</P>
<P>
Locals welcome
</P>
<P>
"The NFL is trying to create more opportunities for the locals to
be involved," she said.
</P>
<P>
Soroka is part of a Tampa Bay contingent that fanned out across
Phoenix, Glendale and surrounding areas this week to get a taste
of what to expect next year. The group hosted a party Thursday
night that had some star power of its own.
</P>
<P>
Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, who's leading
the planning effort for the 2011 Super Bowl in North Texas,
stopped by, and former Vice President Dan Quayle popped in to rub
elbows with the legendary ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
Reid Sigmon, executive director of Tampa's host committee, said
he and his staff have touched base with multiple media outlets
gearing up for 2009 in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, about 3,500 media-types received credentials to cover
Super Bowl activities in Tampa. This year, a record 4,786
credentials were issued to U.S. and international media from
print, television, radio and Internet outlets.
</P>
<P>
When Tampa last hosted a Super Bowl, ESPN radio broadcast from a
corner of the Marriott Waterside Hotel with a staff of 16 people.
</P>
<P>
"That was basically a couple of tables put together," said Keith
Goralski, senior director of operations and events for ESPN
Productions. "Now we have multimedia sets."
</P>
<P>
Corporate excess
</P>
<P>
The outfit brought a staff of 40 to Arizona and broadcast radio
shows from stages in Phoenix, Glendale and Scottsdale with the
programs shown on television and the Internet and sent to the
mobile devices of Verizon Wireless subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Sprint set up stages in Phoenix and Scottsdale, from where it
sent celebrity and athlete interviews with the likes of 50 Cent,
Paris Hilton, Jerry Rice and Barry Sanders directly to Sprint
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a space that everybody wants to be in," said Josh Wine
of Intersport, which produces original content for Sprint. "It's
a new outlet for the guys to be seen and heard."
</P>
<P>
John Moors, director of the Tampa Convention Center, said he was
struck by how elaborate corporate sponsor booths have become.
Gatorade turned one room in the Phoenix Convention Center into a
small bowling alley to promote its new low-calorie drink.
</P>
<P>
"To me it seems like it's all taken up to another level since
2001," he said. "There's obviously a lot of cash flowing."
