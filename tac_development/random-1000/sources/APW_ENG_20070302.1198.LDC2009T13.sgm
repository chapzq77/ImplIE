Chelsea striker Didier Drogba was crowned African Player of the
Year for 2006, edging out Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o.

The Ivory Coast forward, who is the top scorer in the English
Premier League with 17 goals this season, also beat out Chelsea
teammate and Ghana international Michael Essien.

"It's a fitting reward for Didier Drogba's efforts," said Ghana's
President John Kufuor, one of the guests at the ceremony. "I'm
not surprised he won."

Drogba, who moved to Chelsea from French club Marseille in 2004,
has played a major part in Chelsea's two Premier League triumphs.

Eto'o, who has just returned to the Barcelona lineup after a
five-month injury layoff, helped the Spanish club win the
Champions League last season as well as the domestic league title
for the second year in a row.
