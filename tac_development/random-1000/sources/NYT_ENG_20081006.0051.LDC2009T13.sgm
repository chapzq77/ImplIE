JEEP WRANGLER LESS ROUGH, STILL READY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether planning to drive up the beach on South Padre Island in
Texas or on the red-rock trails of Utah's stunningly beautiful
Arches National Park, the newest generation of the Jeep Wrangler
might very well be the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades
ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most
remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles
have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Jeep rolled out the redesigned Wrangler, whose
roots can be traced back to the military jeeps used by the U.S.
armed forces during World
</P>
<P>
War II.
</P>
<P>
This latest version, though, is a lot more refined than even the
previous model, let alone those rather crude early military
models.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows
and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable
doors.
</P>
<P>
Another innovation: Jeep added the first four-door version to the
lineup with the redesign -- the model called the Wrangler
Unlimited.
</P>
<P>
While some Jeep purists might complain that the newest Wrangler
is too gentrified for their tastes, I don't agree. I appreciate
having a somewhat comfortable as well as ultimately capable
vehicle to take me into the places most people never will see.
</P>
<P>
What's important is that the Wrangler's styling remains true to
the brand, something Chrysler's designers clearly understood when
they created the new generation.
</P>
<P>
The Wrangler still has the signature shape, seven-slot grille,
round headlights, trapezoid-shaped wheel flares, exposed door and
windshield hinges, and a windshield that can be folded down.
</P>
<P>
Changes to the exterior were subtle and included a new molded
front bumper with integrated fog lights and sealed headlights
with 20 percent brighter halogen bulbs.
</P>
<P>
The current Wrangler is 5 inches wider than before, with a track
that is 3.5 inches wider. The extra width was added to increase
interior space, but might be a problem on really narrow trails,
such as the ones in Washington state that are used for the annual
Cascades Jeep Jamboree.
</P>
<P>
But for most trails, the extra width won't get in the way. The
Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive
as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family. The
back seat is meant for just two, and there is virtually no cargo
space behind the seat. None of that really changed with the
makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable
than before.
</P>
<P>
There still is room only for four people in the two-door model,
but the front seats now have 4.6 inches more hip room and 5.1
inches more shoulder room. Rear seats have 3.9 inches of
additional shoulder room, 1.6 inches more hip room and an inch
more legroom.
</P>
<P>
The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but
that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward
if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
</P>
<P>
With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the
back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it --
46.4 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
The four-door has a 116-inch-wheelbase versus 95.4 inches for the
standard-length Wrangler, and it's 20.6 inches longer.
</P>
<P>
Even with all of the changes -- including the quietest cabin ever
in a Jeep -- the Wrangler still has the off-road abilities that
have made the Wrangler the preferred vehicle of serious four-
wheel-drive enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the automaker says the new model offers even more off-
road prowess than its predecessor. The newest Wrangler has more
ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid
axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems. Also added were
optional electric axle lockers and an electrically operated
disconnecting sway bar.
</P>
<P>
Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and
the Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield
combinations, Jeep said.
</P>
<P>
For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base
price $28,190 plus $700 freight).Ours didn't come with the
optional hardtop or the glass power windows; we had the canvas
top, traditional half-doors and zip-down plastic windows. We
didn't have the power door locks, either.
</P>
<P>
What we did have was the Rubicon's great off-road equipment,
which includes
</P>
<P>
Jeep's Off-Road Rock-Trac transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear
ratio, as well as the front and rear electronic axle lockers, the
sway-bar system and 32-inch B.F. Goodrich off-road tires.
</P>
<P>
Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than
before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter. Suspension
improvements include advanced shock tuning.
</P>
<P>
The Wranglers -- both the two- and four-door models -- come with
a choice of removable hard or soft tops. Among those is a three-
piece modular top, whose two front sections can be stored inside
the vehicle after being removed.
</P>
<P>
A new "Sunrider" soft top includes a sunroof feature that allows
it to open partially. It also can be removed completely to turn
the vehicle into a convertible.
</P>
<P>
Powering all Wranglers is a 3.8-liter V-6 engine rated at 202
horsepower and 237 foot-pounds of torque. For the first time, no
four-cylinder is offered, which probably was a mistake
considering what has happened with gasoline prices. A six-speed
manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is
optional.
</P>
<P>
EPA ratings are 15 miles per gallon city/19 highway with either
gearbox for the four-wheel-drive models and 15/20 for the two-
wheel-drive model.
</P>
<P>
New for 2009, Hill Start Assist is standard on all 2009 Jeep
Wrangler models to prevent rollback on graded surfaces. Nine
exterior colors are offered, and wheel choices include 16-, 17-
and 18-inch versions.
</P>
<P>
Three skid plates are included on four-wheel-drive models to
protect the fuel tank, transfer case and automatic transmission
oil pan from rocks and logs.
</P>
<P>
X and Sahara four-wheel-drive models come with Jeep's second-
generation Command-Trac part-time, two-speed transfer case. A
Trac-Lok limited-slip rear differential is optional.
</P>
<P>
The only extras on our test vehicle were the automatic
transmission ($825), navigation system ($1,275), trailer-towing
package ($270) and "deep water blue pearl coat" paint ($225).
Total sticker price was $31,485, including freight and options.
</P>
<P>
The trailer package now includes Trailer Sway Control, which Jeep
says monitors the vehicle's movement relative to the driver's
intended path and activates the stability control system if the
trailer begins to sway.
