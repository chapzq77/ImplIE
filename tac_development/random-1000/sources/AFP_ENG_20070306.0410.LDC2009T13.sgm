Ukrainian storage facility to guarantee better gas supply to
Europe: PM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ukraine plans to build an underground gas storage facility to
make the delivery of gas to Europe more reliable, Ukrainian Prime
Minister Viktor Yanukovych said Tuesday in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
"There are recommendations which we support to build an
underground gas storage facility in Ukraine for one billion cubic
metres of gas, with the aim of stabilising gas delivery not only
to Hungary but also to (the rest of) Europe," Yanukovych told a
joint press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc
Gyurcsany.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych said 113 billion cubic metres (3,990 cubic feet) of
gas were delivered to Europe annually from Ukraine, a major
transit country for Russian gas.
</P>
<P>
Russia supplied 24 percent of the European Union's total gas
needs in 2005, representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the
bloc. Of that, about 80 percent transits through Ukraine, while
the rest goes through Belarus.
</P>
<P>
EU countries are concerned about the reliability of gas supplies
from the east after Russia threatened in December of last year to
cut off gas supplies to Belarus following a price dispute.
</P>
<P>
In January 2006, a similar pricing conflict between Russia and
Ukraine led to a sharp fall in gas deliveries to Europe at a time
of peak demand during cold winter months.
