Israel's housing minister said Tuesday that bids would go out
soon to build 1,100 apartments in east Jerusalem -- a move sure
to anger Palestinians, who claim the city's eastern sector as
capital of a future state.

Housing Minister Zeev Boim told Israel Radio that bids would go
out soon to build 350 apartments in the Har Homa neighborhood and
an additional 750 in Pisgat Zeev.

The announcement two months ago that Israel would build more
apartments in Har Homa soured peace talks with the Palestinians
even before they began. Israel annexed east Jerusalem after
capturing it in the 1967 Mideast war, and does not consider
construction there to be settlement activity, as the Palestinians
and international community do.
