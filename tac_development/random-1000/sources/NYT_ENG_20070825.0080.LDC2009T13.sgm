HISTORIC POLISH SHIPYARD STRUGGLES IN A NEW AGE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GDANSK, Poland
</P>
<P>
The famous shipyard here, where the world-changing events of the
Solidarity movement played out, is once again the subject of a
standoff, this time between the Polish government and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Gdansk shipyard could go bankrupt if it is forced to pay back
millions in disputed state subsidies deemed illegal by European
officials. But the most surprising thing may be that there has
been little popular outcry over the threat to the famous port.
The nation is transfixed by the sudden collapse of its government
and preoccupied with the departure of an estimated one million
workers, most of them young, for jobs in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The troubles at the shipyard, and the reaction to it, reveal the
larger contradictions in the Polish economy and society, where
there is a widening gulf between those in modern businesses and
those who are left behind, anchored in older industries like
shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Gdansk shipyard still hums with activity.
Shirtless workers strain in the hot August sun. Green cranes loom
overhead, a series of enormous crooked arms. The glow of a
welding torch looks like a tiny firefly against the hulking mass
of a half-built ship's hull.

"I am shocked now because I participated in this great strike for
a better future; now after so many years the situation is
hopeless for us," said Krzysztof Maciejewski, smoking a Route
66-brand cigarette after his day at the yard. He said he was
making 400 euros, or $544, a month, about a quarter of what he
could make in Western European shipyards. He said many of his
colleagues had left for Norway.
</P>
<P>
The exquisite architecture of this Baltic port city's restored
old town and nearby beaches have set off a tourism boom. In late
August the cafes and cobblestone lanes are jammed with visitors.
Engineering students are founding startups, and there is even a
research center run by the Intel Corp., the semiconductor
manufacturer, in town.
</P>
<P>
The European Union may be threatening the shipyard, but it comes
bearing much larger gifts for Poland as a whole. From 2007 to
2013, Poland is set to receive $91.4 billion in aid from
Brussels. The shipyard, which once employed about 17,000 people,
now provides jobs for a more modest 3,000.
</P>

"Polish people have received a lot of lessons on the free
economy," said Gdansk's mayor, Pawel Adamowicz, in an interview
in his office. "Now in a less emotional way they react to
problems, for example with the Gdansk shipyard."
