DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 2008-09-02 16:43:18 UTC

The Tehran bureau chief for Al-Arabiya television has been banned
by Iranian authorities from working in the Islamic Republic and
was told on Tuesday to leave the country as soon as possible, the
Saudi-owned network told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the Dubai-based TV station spoke on
condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue
involving its reporter Hassan Fahas, based in Tehran since 2000.
</P>
<P>
The network's representative did not want to elaborate on how the
decision of Iranian Information Ministry to revoke Fahas' press
accreditation and declare him "persona non grata" will affect Al-
Arabiya's news office in Iran, involving a staff of a dozen
reporters, producers and cameramen.
</P>
<P>
"It is not yet clear if they are deporting our bureau chief or
closing our (Tehran) office," the Al-Arabiya representative said.
"Either way, the message to the network is clear," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have long complained of Al-Arabiya's coverage
of Iran as biased. The network has rejected the criticism, saying
that it had always given Iranian officials the chance to take
part in its programs.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arabiya opened its Tehran office in 2003. The network's
Lebanese-born bureau chief Hassan Fahas has lived in Iran's
capital since 2000.
</P>
<P>
He has also worked for Saudi-owned newspaper Al Hayat, based in
London.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Al-Arabiya released earlier on Tuesday, Fahas was
quoted as saying that the decision to deport him from Iran was
part of a "public campaign against Al-Arabiya, orchestrated by
some Iranian officials and pro-government media."
