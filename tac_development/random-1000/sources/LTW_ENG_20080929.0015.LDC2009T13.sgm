Supreme Court to Tackle Drug Maker Liability, Censorship
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The court also will decide whether officials can be held liable
for violations of rights that took place on their watch. In a Los
Angeles case, the justices will decide whether the former county
district attorney can be sued by a man who was wrongfully
convicted of murder based on the testimony of a jail-house
informer with a record of lying. And in a New York case, the
justices will decide whether former U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft can be held liable for the arrest and alleged
mistreatment of Muslim immigrants after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the justices will meet behind closed doors to sift
through more than 2,000 appeal petitions that have piled up over
the summer. They are expected on Tuesday to announce they will
hear a handful of those cases.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 6, the court will begin hearing oral arguments. First up
is a case that tests whether the makers of "light" and "low tar"
cigarettes can be sued for allegedly seeking to fool smokers into
thinking these cigarettes are safer.
</P>
<P>
The court has much at stake in who is elected president in
November. On the major issues, such abortion, race, religion, the
death penalty, gun rights, gay rights and presidential power, the
justices have been sharply divided. The court regularly splits
5-4 on those issues, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy casting the
deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
The retirement of a single justice could tip the balance to the
right or the left. At age 88, Justice John Paul Stevens is seen
as likely to step down during the next president's term. A second
of the liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is 75, and could be
replaced by the next president, particularly if the newly elected
chief executive serves eight years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
So far, the court does not have before it a hot-button case on
abortion, race or religion, although that could change after new
cases are added in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
For consumers as well as corporations, the most far-reaching case
to be heard this fall tests a patient's right to sue if he or she
is hurt or even killed by a federally approved drug.
</P>
<P>
Bush administration lawyers have quietly pressed the theory that
if a product is regulated by a federal agency, its regulations
"pre-empt" or block lawsuits that set stricter standards. Not
surprisingly, this approach has won the backing of manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Product makers want "national, uniform standards," said Robin
Conrad, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, not

for Ukraine// (Sevastopol) By Megan K. Stack(c) 2008, Los Angeles
Times
</P>
<P>
SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine -- Skimming the Black Sea aboard a military
motorboat, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo turned to an
entourage of television cameras. "The dirty ones, those are the
Ukrainian ships," he said with a light smirk. "The clean ones are
Russian."
</P>
<P>
Against a backdrop of simmering tensions, Dygalo led journalists
on an unusual wide-ranging visit to Russia's Black Sea Fleet this
month,  complete with unprecedented access to the flagship
Moskva, a guided missile cruiser. The public relations tour came
just as the strategically crucial Russian base here finds itself
at the epicenter of an escalating political clash.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by Russia's recent war in Georgia, the Ukrainian
government has imposed new restrictions on the Russian ships'
movements, and suggested raising the rent on the fleet. The
Ukrainian president has called the surrounding Crimean Peninsula
-- historically a part of Russia and still home to a majority
Russian population -- the most dangerous spot in the country
because of separatist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Russia has responded with icy vows to beef up its military forces
in the Black Sea, eagerly showing off to reporters the firepower
aboard vessels that were used to blockade Georgia -- and to
remind the world of the deep Russian roots in this restive
Ukrainian region.
</P>
<P>
"The military budget will be revisited so that we can exploit
these ships better and build new ships," said Dygalo aboard the
Moskva. "The attitude toward the international situation has
changed, of course. We understand quite well that Russia came
under pressure."
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been climbing in this sleepy port since the
fighting in Georgia brought into sharp focus two clashing
interests: Russia's determination to take on a greater role in
the former Soviet states, and the Ukrainian government's
determination to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The
war in Georgia pitted a Western-friendly government against
Moscow; Ukraine, meanwhile, is painfully divided in loyalties to
the West and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Crimea is Russian-friendly turf. Former Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev gave the peninsula to Ukraine back when the shared
flag made the distinction between the two countries relatively
unimportant.
</P>
<P>
Today, many residents of Crimea say they are Russian first,
Ukrainian second. They vehemently oppose Ukraine's bid to join
NATO, bristle at anti-Moscow rhetoric from national leaders and
say they are embittered by government efforts to infuse Crimea
with Ukrainian language and culture.
</P>
<P>
Because of Crimea's staunch pro-Russia sentiments, analysts warn
that the country could simply break apart if politicians in
Ukraine continue their push toward NATO and the West.
</P>
<P>
"Most threats from Ukraine don't come from outside, but from
inside," said Vladimir Kornilov, a political scientist in Kiev.
"Ukraine is living on its own volcano."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse the Black Sea Fleet of deliberately exacerbating
the tension.
</P>
<P>
"All the anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russia blocs are closely tied to the
Black Sea Fleet," said Miroslav Mamchak, the snowy-haired chief
of a group called the Ukrainian Community of Sevastopol. "They
struggle against the Ukrainian language. They support the
separatists."
</P>
<P>
Mamchak is a rare voice of Ukrainian nationalism here. He says
that he has received death threats, and that Russian loyalists
plastered the town with his picture under the slogan, "I'm a
traitor to Russia."
</P>
<P>
Black Sea Fleet officials deny any political tampering. But many
Ukrainians worry that the Russian government is stealthily
working to stir up separatist sentiment. There have been reports
that Russia has quietly begun to grant passports to some
residents; Russian officials say it's not true.
</P>
<P>
Powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov, who has been banned from
Ukraine for his rhetoric on Crimea, has said the region "doesn't
belong" to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Sevastopol have long had close ties, and the Moscow
city government has built schools and apartment housing in the
Ukrainian city. One opulent school is decorated with stained
glass depictions of Moscow, and a university is affiliated with
Moscow State University.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Moscow residents regard Mamchak's political organization as
part of a Kiev-backed effort at "ethnocide."
</P>
<P>
Many locals gripe about the mandatory teaching of the Ukrainian
language in schools and its use in the media and government
paperwork. Pro-Russia leaders also accuse the Ukrainian
government of slowly moving people into the region from other
parts of the country, and of installing pro-Kiev leaders in the
city government.
</P>
<P>
"Faster, faster, faster to make everybody a Ukrainian,"
complained Raisa Telyatnikova, head of the Russian Community of
Sevastopol. "They want to completely distance us from our
historical motherland, Russia, and turn it into an alien state.
... They want to change the ethnic composition and break the
spirit of Sevastopol."
</P>
<P>
With its clusters of war memorials and Soviet awards from
Vladimir I. Lenin still adorning the walls of the town hall,
today's Sevastopol has the feel of a living monument to the USSR,
or at least to the power of Moscow. Russian flags flutter
throughout the city, a statue of Catherine the Great looms on the
main street, and Russian is heard on most every corner.
Bookstores stock a paltry number of Ukrainian titles. "It's only
the language of state business," one bookseller said with a
shrug.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fleet's warm ties with the locals, politicians in
Ukraine have made it plain that the Russian navy could be asked
to leave after its lease expires in 2017. Russia, however, has
other ideas. The fleet's presence here is woven into history,
Russian military officials say. The ships will stay put, and
multiply, they have said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing prevents us from building up our forces here in
Ukrainian territory," said Rear Adm. Andrei Baranov, the fleet's
deputy chief of staff. "The fleet will be renovated. ... New
ships will be arriving here."
</P>
<P>
On the ground of St. Nicholas the Sanctifier Church, the bones of
an estimated 60,000 Russian fighters, casualties of the Crimean
War in the 19th century and World War II, lie in a vast, quiet
cemetery that rolls downhill toward the sea. On the steps of the
sanctuary, priests spoke of their emotional ties to generations
of sailors, and of their unwillingness to hoist a Ukrainian flag.
</P>
<P>
In a scene that seemed cut from czarist times, Russian navy
officials and Orthodox priests sat at a long table, knocking back
shots of vodka and proclaiming emotional toasts.
</P>
<P>
"The West shuddered 150 years ago when Russia showed its sword,
and the Black Sea turned red with blood," said Igor Bebin, a
pink-robed priest who rose to his feet, vodka glass held high.
"That was the supreme truth. And the truth is that now, for the
first time, the sword of Russia is shining again. Be afraid of
the sword."
</P>
<P>
The Russians cheered, and took a deep drink.
