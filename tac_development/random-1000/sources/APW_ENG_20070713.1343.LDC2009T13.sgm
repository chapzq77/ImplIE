Two prominent Republican senators draft bill requiring Bush to
narrow mission of U.S. troops

WASHINGTON 2007-07-13 20:18:30 UTC
</P>
<P>
Two prominent Senate Republicans have drafted legislation that
would require President George W., Bush to come up with a plan by
mid-October to dramatically narrow the mission of U.S. troops in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which represents a sharp challenge to Bush from
senior members of his own party, was put forward Friday by Sens.
John Warner and Richard Lugar, and it came as the Pentagon
acknowledged that a decreasing number of Iraqi army battalions
are able to operate independently of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
"Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few
manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's factions, the
optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, pluralist, democratic
government that is able to police itself, protect its borders,
and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in
the near future," the Warner-Lugar proposal said.
</P>
<P>
Bush has asked Congress to hold off on demanding a change in the
course of the war until September, when the top U.S. commander,
Gen. David Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, delivers a
fresh assessment of its progress.
</P>
<P>
Warner and Lugar are well regarded within Congress on defense
issues. Warner was the longtime chairman of the Armed Services
Committee before stepping down last year, while Lugar is the top
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Warner-Lugar proposal states that "American military and
diplomatic strategy in Iraq must adjust to the reality that
sectarian factionalism is not likely to abate anytime soon and
probably cannot be controlled from the top."
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Warner and Lugar say Bush must draft a plan for U.S.
troops that would keep them from "policing the civil strife or
sectarian violence in Iraq" and focus them instead on protecting
Iraq's borders, targeting terrorists and defending U.S. assets.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, meanwhile, Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the number of
battle-ready Iraqi battalions able to fight on their own has
dropped to a half-dozen from 10 in recent months despite
heightened American training efforts.
</P>
<P>
Without providing numbers, the White House had acknowledged in
its report to Congress Thursday that not enough progress was
being made in training Iraqi security forces -- an issue that
determines to a large extent when the United States may be able
to reduce its forces there.
</P>
<P>
Pace, however, also said the readiness of the Iraqi fighting
units was not an issue to be "overly concerned" about because the
problem is partly attributable to the fact that the Iraq units
are out operating in the field.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at a news conference with Defense Secretary Robert
Gates, Pace said that "as units operate in the field, they have
casualties, they consume vehicles and equipment."
</P>
<P>
The Warner-Lugar proposal is the first major legislative
challenge to Bush's Iraq policy endorsed by the two senators --
and lent a more bipartisan imprint to congressional
dissatisfaction with the war now in its fifth year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, both Lugar and Warner expressed grave doubts
about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq. But
both have been reluctant to back binding legislation that would
force the president's hand.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would direct Bush to present the new strategy to
Congress by Oct. 16 and suggests it be ready for implementation
by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also would seek to make Bush renew the authorization
for war that Congress gave him in 2002. Many members contend that
authorization -- which led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003
-- was limited to approval of deposing dictator Saddam Hussein
and searching for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving developments capped another stressful week for
Bush and administration figures who have been resisting attempts
by majority Democrats in Congress to force a U.S. troop
withdrawal. The administration sent to the Hill an interim
progress report Thursday which said that only about half of some
18 congressionally mandated benchmarks for improvements in the
government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have been
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exhorted
congressional critics to give the administration and the
fledgling government until September to "make a coherent judgment
of where we are."
</P>
<P>
The day after the House of Representatives voted 223-201 for a
Democratic proposal to force a U.S. troop withdrawal by next
spring, she acknowledged that al-Maliki's government has not
achieved "as much progress as we would like. But we shouldn't
just dismiss as inconsequential the progress that they have
made."
</P>
<P>
And Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon, a top U.S. commander in Iraq,
told Pentagon reporters in a separate news conference via video
linkup from Iraq that "there will be consequences" if U.S. troops
withdraw too soon.
</P>
<P>
Mixon spoke of a troop drawdown that would be smaller and slower
than Democrats envision.
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be well thought out," he said of any plans to drawn
down forces. "It cannot be a strategy that is based on 'Well, we
need to leave.' That's not a strategy, that's a withdrawal."
