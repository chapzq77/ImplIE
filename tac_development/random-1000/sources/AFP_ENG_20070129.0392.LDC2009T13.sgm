Saudi Arabia names new ambassador to US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi Arabia on Monday announced that Adel al-Jubeir, an advisor
to King Abdullah, has been named as its new ambassador  to the
United States, the oil- rich kingdom's top diplomatic posting.
</P>
<P>
Jubeir, also a former spokesman at the embassy in Washington,
replaces Prince Turki al-Faisal who resigned abruptly in December
for what he said were family reasons.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced by royal decree on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with a request from Prince Turki al-Faisal bin
Abdul Aziz... to be discharged from his duties and in accordance
with a proposal from the foreign minister, we have ordered the
nomination of Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir as ambassador to the
United States with the rank of minister," said the decree,
reported by the official news agency SPA.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post had said last year that Prince Turki had been
increasingly rumoured as a possible replacement for his brother,
Foreign Minister Saud al- Faisal, who it said was in fragile
health.
</P>
<P>
When Prince Turki flew home after only 15 months in the crucial
diplomatic post, a source at the Saudi embassy said he had left
after telling staff he was quitting because he wanted to spend
more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is regarded as a close regional ally of the
United States, although differences have emerged over
Washington's policy in violence-wracked Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Prince Turki made a series of speeches last year urging
Washington not to withdraw its troops from Iraq precipitously,
and repeatedly urged the White House to try to break the deadlock
in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Before taking up the Washington job in 2005, he spent nearly
three years as ambassador in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He also spent 25 years as the head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Prince
Turki worked closely with Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in
organising Muslim volunteers to join the Afghan insurgency.
</P>
<P>
In a November 2001 interview with the Saudi MBC television
channel, he confirmed meeting bin Laden several times in Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan before 1994.
</P>
<P>
After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Prince
Turki was named in a civil suit in the US courts by the families
of victims seeking damages over his alleged role in financing bin
Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network. The lawsuit was dismissed in
2003.
