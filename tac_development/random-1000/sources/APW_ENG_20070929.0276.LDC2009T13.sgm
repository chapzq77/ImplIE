Minor premiers Geelong broke a 44-year title drought and a run of
five fruitless finals appearances when it beat Port Adelaide
24.19 (163), 6.8 (44) in the Australian Rules Football League
Grand Final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Geelong Cats topped regular season standings by 12 points
with a 19-win, one-loss record to secure the minor premiership,
and confirmed their rating as the best team in the AFL with
Saturday's historic win over the 2004 champions.
</P>
<P>
"We were the best side all year and we thoroughly deserve this,"
Geelong midfielder Joel Corey said.
</P>
<P>
Geelong became the first team from the state of Victoria since
Essendon in 2000 to win the AFL title when they eased to victory
in front of a crowd of 98,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
</P>
<P>
Coach Mark Thompson became the seventh man in AFL history to have
both captained and coached a team to premiership victory. He had
previous captained Essendon to the championship in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Geelong's 119-point win was the largest in grand final history,
dwarfing Hawthorn's 96-point win over Melbourne in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Cats dominated the match, outscoring Port Adelaide 5.7 to 2.2
in the first quarter, before kicking five goals in the first 12
minutes of the second quarter to build a 52-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Geelong were on top in every aspect of the contest, with their
defense -- which has been the best in the competition all season
-- keeping Port Adelaide to their lowest score of the year.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to thank the fans for their patience," Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming but it's worth the wait."
</P>
<P>
Geelong's Steve Johnson was named Man of the Match. Johnson began
the season suspended for off-field behaviour and ended up an All-
Australian and premiership player.
</P>
<P>
Johnson kicked four goals from half-forward.
