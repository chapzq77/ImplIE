To Treat Illegal Migrants or Not, a High-Cost Dialysis Decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio,
an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned
recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her
alive.
</P>
<P>
She has never seen a bill.
</P>
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in
California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney
transplant in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina,
which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs. She needed to
go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her
blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
</P>
<P>
The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket
back to California.
</P>
<P>
"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for
another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician
poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital
dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Health services and other benefits available to illegal
immigrants can vary by the state. Welfare, prenatal care or in-
state college tuition might be available in one place and
inaccessible across a state line.
</P>
<P>
The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward
its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants. With limited federal
guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions,
frequently shaped by political winds.
</P>
<P>
Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the
occasional absurdities -- that result.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients is not large. In California, illegal
immigrants account for about 1,350 of the 61,000 people on
dialysis. Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
</P>
<P>
But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime
commitment. The investment in a single patient can easily top $1
million over time.
</P>
<P>
Many states draw the line at illegal immigrants. But officials in
California, New York and a few other states figure that not
treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
</P>
<P>
That is because patients without regular dialysis frequently end
up in emergency rooms. At that point, federal law requires that
they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released
-- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to
the ER.
</P>
<P>
It's like "rescuing a person from drowning, giving someone a good
meal and then pushing them over the side," said Dr. Laurence
Lewin, a kidney specialist in Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health,
it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue. In
Texas, where illegal immigrants generally can't get routine care,
some have cycled through the emergency room at El Paso's Thomason
Hospital more than 100 times for life-saving dialysis, said
kidney specialist Dr. Azikiwe Nwosu.
</P>
<P>
Such patients are at increased risk of heart attacks and
infections.
</P>
<P>
"It's heartbreaking," said Dr. Claudia Zacharek, a kidney
specialist who until recently worked in Galveston, Texas. "Your
hands are tied."

<P>
In grappling with what services to provide for illegal
immigrants, some states tip toward the need to care for the sick.
Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their
presence.
</P>
<P>
Congress tried to establish a balance. In 1986, it barred illegal
immigrants from the federal health benefits generally available
to the poor, with one notable exception: emergencies. The federal
government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal
immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is
open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without
immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or
impair bodily functions, parts or organs.
</P>

<P>
Debates have flared over chemotherapy, life-support and dialysis.
In 2002, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential
nominee, cosponsored a bill to provide dialysis and other chronic
care needed to prevent expensive ER visits.
</P>
<P>
It failed. What's left is an ambiguous policy that the federal
government itself has struggled to clarify.
</P>
<P>
"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary
Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in
early 2007.
</P>
<P>
If California and other states were using federal funds to help
provide routine dialysis, she said, they were mischaracterizing
it as an emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
More recently, she acknowledged that the federal government has
been sharing the cost in California for years. It has long been
left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Many states, including Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, take the
position that kidney failure does not automatically qualify as an
emergency because patients can survive for weeks without dialysis
before toxins accumulate to fatal levels.
</P>
<P>
Other states have wavered. North Carolina, for example, now
provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants. Conversely, the
Georgia Medicaid program stopped paying for dialysis in 2006 amid
rising sentiments in the Legislature that illegal immigrants were
a financial drain.
</P>
<P>
"Georgia ain't California or New York," said Mark Trail, head of
Georgia's Medicaid program until last month, noting a strong
conservative tradition.
</P>
<P>
The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
</P>
<P>
A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the
state attempted to cut off their dialysis. Heeding arguments that
sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge
told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
In a settlement last year, the state agreed to restore its policy
of providing routine dialysis,  but the settlement applies only
to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
California's dialysis policy is largely an economic calculation,
said Stan Rosenstein, the administrator of Medi-Cal, the state
health-care program for the poor that covers dialysis for illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The cost of one routine treatment is about $250. The cost of
providing it in the emergency room can  climb into the thousands
of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
To advocates of stricter immigration controls, such comparisons
miss the point.
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers are on the hook for people who aren't supposed to be
here," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for
Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will
lure more sick people from other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We can not provide dialysis to the world," said Ramiro Valdez, a
Dallas social worker and medical consultant.
</P>
<P>
Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines,
hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to
the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed
her mind. Now, a free transportation service picks her up three
days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
"If I go home, I won't be able to afford this," said Aquino, 56.
"No way am I going home."
</P>
<P>
Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said
patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California,
but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand
the gravity of their plight.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to
move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local
taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid
program does not.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Karla Vital, a kidney specialist at University of Texas
Medical Branch in Galveston, said her hospital encourages Mexican
nationals to return to Mexico. Some hospitals pay for plane
tickets back.
</P>
<P>
Mexico offers dialysis to those who can afford it, but access is
far more limited for the poor.
</P>

Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started
dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in
Mexico. But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I have friends who have died because of lack of dialysis," said
Lopez, a longtime diabetic who arrived in the U.S. four years ago
while her kidneys were still functioning.
</P>
<P>
The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a
procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal
immigrants. Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in
California were for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three
dialysis-free years. Critics, however, say that dipping into the
organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are
waiting.
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you go to Costco and pick up a kidney," Krikorian
said.
</P>
<P>
Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
</P>
<P>
She said she is grateful for the care she has received in
California. But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an
hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes
the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor
pool.
</P>
<P>
As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents
in Mexico, she has never returned.
</P>
<P>
It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be
able to get back.
