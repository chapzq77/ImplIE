Japan's ruling bloc loses first election under Fukuda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's opposition said Monday the tide was turning against the
ruling bloc after its candidate was voted mayor of Osaka in the
first election under Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also said it was the wrong time to discuss key
legislation that would enable Japan to resume its naval mission
supporting the "war on terror," citing scandals which involve the
defence ministry and the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The opposition-supported candidate ousted the incumbent backed by
Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's election in
Japan's second city after a campaign that drew senior national
lawmakers from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"It was proof that voters in Osaka did not approve of the Fukuda
administration and the administration supported by the Liberal
Democratic Party," said Yukio Hatoyama, secretary general of the
main opposition Democratic Party of Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This symbolises nationwide politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition won one house of parliament in July in a voter
backlash against a raft of scandals under then prime minister
Shinzo Abe.
</P>
<P>
Abe, an outspoken conservative, abruptly quit after the
opposition refused his calls to extend a naval mission supporting
the US-led "war on terror" in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda, a 71-year-old centrist political veteran, took over in
late September. He is in the midst of a battle with the
opposition to restart the naval deployment.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend summit in Washington, Fukuda promised US President
George W. Bush to work to resume the mission, which provided fuel
and other support on the Indian Ocean to the US-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda's government downplayed the significance of the Osaka
election.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate that the candidate supported by the Liberal
Democratic Party and New Komeito lost," chief government
spokesman Nobutaka Machimura said, referring to the LDP's
coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not analysing it at the level of national politics. I
don't think this will affect politics at the national level," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the election, Kunio Hiramatsu, a former television newscaster
supported by the opposition, defeated the LDP-backed incumbent
Junichi Seki, who was first elected in 2003. The election was
nominally non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
The election offers good news for the opposition after a tough
month in which its leader Ichiro Ozawa offered to resign and then
retracted it in a feud over whether to join Fukuda in a grand
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has also gone on the offensive over a growing
scandal in which the recently retired top bureaucrat at the
defence ministry acknowledged that a military contractor treated
him to gifts, dinner and more than 200 golf trips.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, which controls the upper house, reiterated that
it would probe the scandal before taking up a bill on the naval
mission.
</P>
<P>
Fukuda wants the military legislation to pass during the current
parliament session that ends on December 15, but secretary
general Hatoyama said "they can't realise that wish."
</P>
<P>
"The ruling bloc may need to extend the current session again,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and business is
just being divulged in the defence ministry scandal. Naturally,
now is not the time to discuss the new anti-terror legislation,"
Hatoyama said.
