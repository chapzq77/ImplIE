Russian shareholders seeking to oust the British chief executive
of joint oil venture TNK-BP failed to get enough votes for his
dismissal at a board meeting on Monday but vowed to continue
fighting.In a statement, the Russian shareholders said only two
out of five directors at a board meeting of management company
TNK-BP Management had voted in favour of dismissing chief
executive Robert Dudley, while three had voted against.
</P>
<P>
The two sides each own 50 percent of TNK-BP, Russia's third
largest oil producer, but are not equally represented on the
management company's board.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed but not surprised by the results of the
vote," Stan Polovets, representing the Russian shareholders, said
in the statement, acknowledging that BP's representatives had
supported Dudley.
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped and still hope that they would exercise their
fiduciary obligation to all TNK-BP shareholders and vote in
favour of the dismissal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused TNK-BP's management of "numerous
violations" of Russian law and said the company had
underperformed by market standards.
</P>
<P>
From its formation in 2003 "to June 1 this year, TNK-BP's market
capitalisation rose only 138 percent. By contrast Lukoil's value
has increased 467 percent and the Russian stock market rose by
355 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There is only a handful of companies who have done worse than
TNK-BP in the past five years ... One of them is BP, whose stock
has remained flat since 2003," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Polovets confirmed to AFP that the Russian side would continue
their struggle and the issue would be discussed on Friday in
Cyprus at a board meeting of TNK- BP's top holding company, TNK-
BP Limited.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be discussing this issue there again on Friday. This was
the first of many steps ... We have a legal team assessing a
number of different options that will be pursued," Polovets told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
The Russian shareholders' struggle is the latest high-profile
effort to remove foreign control over major Russian energy
assets.
</P>
<P>
But analysts note the state has been unusually reluctant to take
a clear stand.
</P>
<P>
Moscow opened up the sector in the 1990s, seeking outside help to
revive an industry crumbling due to bad management and low
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side in the TNK-BP dispute -- Alfa Group, Access
Industries and Renova -- says BP is treating TNK-BP as a
subsidiary and obstructing its overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June BP chairman Robert Sutherland accused the Russian
shareholders of returning to "corporate raiding activities that
were prevalent in Russia in the 1990s."
