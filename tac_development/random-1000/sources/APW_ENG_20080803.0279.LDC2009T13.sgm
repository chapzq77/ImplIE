ALGIERS, Algeria 2008-08-03 10:19:49 UTC

<P>
A blast near a police station in northern Algeria early Sunday
wounded 21 people, including six police officers, the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in Tizi-Ouzou, a northern city about 100
kilometers (62 miles) east of the capital, Algiers, the ministry
said in a statement that gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said, however, that the explosion appeared to have come
from a van.
</P>
<P>
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but the
country's al-Qaida affiliate -- al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa
-- has said it was behind most recent bombings.
</P>
<P>
The group, formerly known as the GSPC, grew out of an insurgency
in the 1990s. The violence, which left as many as 200,000 dead,
was prompted by the army's cancellation of 1992 legislative
elections that an Islamist party was poised to win. The number of
attacks had diminished before rising again dramatically after the
GSPC in 2006 reaffirmed allegiance to al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
Many attacks in Algeria have targeted the national security
services and military, while others have struck foreigners. A
double suicide bombing in December in Algiers killed 41 people,
including 17 U.N. workers. In April 2007, coordinated suicide
strikes against the main government offices in central Algiers
and a police station killed 33.
</P>
<P>
Tizi-Ouzou and surrounding areas are frequent sites of clashes
between extremists and security forces.
