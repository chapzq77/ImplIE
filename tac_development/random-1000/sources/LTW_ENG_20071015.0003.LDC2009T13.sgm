Struggling With War Stress, Veteran Lives Day to Day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michelle Turner's husband sits in the recliner with the shades
drawn. He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew. On the phone
in the other room, Michelle is pleading with the utility company
to keep their power on.
</P>
<P>
"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?" asks her husband, Troy, who
served as an Army scout in Baghdad and came back with post-
traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
"Troy, they don't care," Michelle says, her patience stretched.
</P>
<P>
The government's sweeping list of promises to make wounded Iraq
war veterans whole, at least financially, has not reached this
small house in the hills of rural West Virginia, where one
vehicle has already been repossessed and the answering machine
screens for bill collectors. The Turners have not been making it
on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of
Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
After revelations about the poor treatment of outpatient soldiers
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center earlier this year, President
Bush appointed a commission to study the care of the nation's
war-wounded. The panel returned with bold recommendations,
including the creation of a national cadre of caseworkers and a
complete overhaul of the military's disability system that
compensates wounded soldiers.
</P>
<P>
But so far, little has been done to sort out the mess of
bureaucracy or put more money in the hands of newly disabled
soldiers who are fending off evictions and foreclosures.
</P>
<P>
In the Turner house, that leaves an exhausted wife with chipped
nail polish to hold up the family's collapsing world. "Stand
Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle. But since
Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
</P>
<P>
Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching
complicated VA policies and disability regulations. "You need two
college degrees to understand any of it," she says, lacking both.
She scavenges information where she can find it. A psychotic
Vietnam vet she met in a VA hospital was the one who told her
that Troy might be eligible for Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get
ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or
randomly explosive. Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may
have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man
who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day
"Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
"He can't make decisions. He is a worrywart. Fearful. It's like
they took Troy and put him in a different person."
</P>
<P>
As thousands of war-wounded lug their discharge papers and pill
bottles home, more than a quarter are returning with PTSD and
brain trauma. Compensation for these invisible injuries is more
difficult and the social isolation more profound, especially in
rural communities where pastures outnumber mental health
providers. Troy's one-year war has become his wife's endless one.
</P>
<P>
The Turners live in a small rental house in the northern tip of
West Virginia, surrounded by enormous blue sky and the dark spine
of South Branch Mountain. There is a VFW tavern in town, but Troy
doesn't bother. After one of his distraught soldier buddies from
Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy
stays away from alcohol. Still, the techniques he learned to calm
his PTSD in Army and VA treatment programs -- tai chi meditation
and classical music -- seem like distant remedies in this county
of farm equipment and Ford pickups.
</P>
<P>
Michelle thinks Troy's anxiety and depression are worsening, and
she tells anyone who will listen -- her pastor, doctors and
counselors at VA. His speech is sometimes soupy from mood
stabilizers. The meds give him tremors. He used to cut the grass
and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a
perpetual patient. His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle
for everything.
</P>
<P>
"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?" he asks one
day.
</P>
<P>
Michelle takes a breath. "Orthopedic," she says. "Troy, (ital)
please try." (end ital)
</P>
<P>
At 31, her eyes are hollowed by worry and her brown hair is
turning gray. The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA
Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they
go once a week. The all-day journey requires a babysitter for the
kids -- ages 10 and 11, both from previous marriages -- and burns
$25 worth of precious gas.
</P>
<P>
"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
</P>
<P>
One hot morning, they set out for Martinsburg yet again. Troy
recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury --
he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital
wants him back for more comprehensive testing. Troy and Michelle
are quiet on the ride into Martinsburg. A Bible rests on the back
seat. The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two-
lane highway. Troy's pill box is between them, along with the
silence.
</P>
<P>
Finally Troy says he thinks his new medication is making him less
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
Michelle is skeptical. "You don't have an `off' button anymore,"
she says.
</P>
<P>
Troy, in the passenger seat, keeps his eyes on the road. "They
broke it off when I was over there."
</P>
<P>
He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion
of Iraq. Before that, he spent a decade with the National Guard,
pulling a tour in Bosnia. A laconic country boy with a plug of
tobacco in his cheek, Troy was a cavalry scout with the 3rd
Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment that pressed into Baghdad. His
platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade,
and others he knew were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
Troy's problems started after his tour. While he was on home
leave from Fort Stewart one weekend, Michelle found him sitting
on the bed with a bottle of pills. He said he couldn't go back.
Michelle drove him to the Martinsburg VA hospital, which shipped
him to Walter Reed for three weeks of psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
He was sent back to Fort Stewart and returned to duty, a reality
he could not cope with. Twice he tried to commit suicide and was
hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being
medically discharged for PTSD in 2004. After 13 years in uniform,
Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349
severance check and no benefits.
</P>
<P>
Michelle was dating Troy at the time. She had visited him at
Walter Reed. When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship,
she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat
her well. They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
</P>
<P>
For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms
began to worsen. He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the
interstate, causing him to shake and panic. His family needed the
$2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in
the truck with him. Finally VA doctors increased Troy's
medication, and he became too zonked to drive.
</P>
<P>
VA rated Troy's disability level at 50 percent, resulting in $860
a month in compensation. Like many wounded soldiers, he was
clobbered by a fine-print government regulation known as
"concurrent receipt," which prevents double compensation. That
meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had
to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army. For 13
months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was
reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
The Turners' foothold in working-class America completely slid
away when Michelle -- who has worked as a teacher's aide and an
inventory-control specialist at Wal-Mart -- developed health
problems and was forced to quit her job. Now her full-time job is
Troy.
</P>
<P>
His illness has eroded their marriage, but on the morning they
arrive at the Martinsburg VA hospital, she leads the charge on
his behalf. The concrete behemoth serves 129,000 vets from West
Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. It is at once
efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
Michelle and Troy move down the hallways, passing a room near the
PTSD residence where a group of young vets, some tattooed and
still muscled from the desert, are playing a game of ring toss.
The cafeteria smells of bleach and canned peaches.
</P>
<P>
In the small lobby of the neuropsychological department, Troy
leans over the sign-in clipboard, pen in hand, staring at the
sheet. Michelle tells him what day it is. They sit together on
the hard chairs until Troy's name is called.
</P>
<P>
With two hours to kill, Michelle wanders into the hallway and
runs into a Vietnam vet she has befriended. A former Marine with
ramrod posture, the vet has PTSD and an encyclopedic knowledge of
VA procedures. "Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
"Huntington (a VA regional office) says you are his fiduciary,
right?"
</P>
<P>
"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle
says.
</P>
<P>
The vet shakes his head angrily. "Don't let these people get over
on you!"
</P>
<P>
She returns to the waiting room. A flier on the bulletin board
catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families." A
door opens, and one of Troy's doctors asks her to step into his
office. When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone
in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse. The doctor
said Troy is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD
offices. Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the
residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in
again. She knocks on the door of a counselor, a big, bald,
friendly man who does not wave off the intrusion.
</P>
<P>
"You think he's violent at this point?" the counselor asks.
</P>
<P>
Michelle dodges the question. "He's not getting any counseling,"
she says, leaning against the door.
</P>
<P>
The counselor explains that all 50 beds in the program are full
and the waiting list is 25 deep. "I apologize for not being able
to get him in right away," he says.
</P>
<P>
Michelle's voice breaks. "I know you are doing the best you can,"
she says. "Anymore, he's just ashamed. I wish I had a video
camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an
average day looks like."
</P>
<P>
She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests. He is yawning
and tired. He tells Michelle how hard he tried, and she smiles
and touches his arm. They go upstairs to make an appointment with
Troy's psychiatrist. The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately
the doctor is on leave for the next month. The first available
slot is five weeks out, at 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"Is there anything later than 8:30?" Michelle asks, politely. "We
have a three-hour drive."
</P>
<P>
Nine o'clock is the they best they can do. The appointment is for
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office
on the first floor. The government has promised to care for its
wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this,
where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage
reimbursed. The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977. While
a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is
still paid 11 cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52. At
the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out,
bringing the grand total to $8.52.
</P>
<P>
On the way home, Michelle pulls into a Flying J truck stop,
pumping gas in the hot breeze, watching the numbers spin higher.
</P>
<P>
Money became so desperate this spring that Michelle contacted
Operation Homefront, a national organization that gives emergency
assistance to deployed service members and the returning wounded.
In a sign of the deepening financial crisis faced by many back
from war, Operation Homefront has provided $2 million in bailout
funds to 4,300 families so far in 2007, double last year's
caseload.
</P>
<P>
The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car
payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for
food. Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they
had no other choice. The $860 VA disability check barely covers
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Michelle has been pushing to have VA re-evaluate Troy in hopes of
getting his disability rating raised and his compensation
increased. He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function
without her. A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a
therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV
chokes the day.
</P>
<P>
"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says. But at least now she
has the help of an assistant officer with the West Virginia
Division of Veterans Affairs in a little office in Moorefield,
about 30 miles from Romney. The officer submits the right
paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is
"chronic and severe." Michelle gets copies of the medical records
and sits down with them on her living room floor. Wearing an Army
T-shirt that says "Got Freedom?" she begins reading. The
documents are a gold mine of information that validate what she
has said all along. But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels
sickened.
</P>
<P>
(begin ital)
</P>
<P>
He has nightmares frequently, two to three times a week, in which
he sees himself back in Iraq ... and Baghdad. He sees himself
fighting, sees dead bodies, parts of bodies, blood rushing from
bodies. In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he
hears bullets passing over his head. He is fearful and scared and
wakes up in cold sweats. Flashbacks are also frequent, 2 or 3
times a week, triggered by helicopters passing over, burn flesh
smell, barbecue, current Iraq news and sometimes seeing military
vehicles brings flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
Michelle goes page by page. Troy is in his recliner holding the
remote control. From time to time she looks up at him, then her
eyes go back to the records.
</P>
<P>
(begin ital)
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of guilt feelings that he could not save his
sergeant.
</P>
<P>
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
She comes to a page that lists Troy's problems.
</P>
<P>
(begin ital)
</P>
<P>
Hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
Tremors.
</P>
<P>
Obesity.
</P>
<P>
PTSD.
</P>
<P>
Depressive disorder.
</P>
<P>
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
Michelle calls out to Troy. "They are saying your memory is
extremely low," she says. "And here's another thing. `Hearing
loss. Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
</P>
<P>
VA concludes that Troy's worsening condition merits an increase
of his disability rating to 70 percent, raising his monthly check
to $1,352 a month. According to VA, he doesn't meet the criteria
for 100 percent because his impairment is not "persistent," with
"persistent delusions" or a "persistent danger of hurting himself
or others." He is still able to perform his own hygiene.
</P>
<P>
From Michelle's point of view, Troy can hold a toothbrush, but he
can't hold a job. "Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family,"
she says. She has a year to appeal the rating.
</P>
<P>
But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a
bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
</P>
<P>
Michelle is relieved. Troy will get help and she will get a
respite. Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation. He
doesn't want to go. During the intake session in Martinsburg, he
is withdrawn and sullen. When the doctor asks if he has been
having suicidal thoughts, he says yes. The news punches Michelle
in the gut.
</P>
<P>
Troy is allowed to come home on weekends, so Michelle makes the
four-hour round trip to pick him up on the first Friday night. On
Sunday, he refuses to go back. He says he has been through it
before. Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he
won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
</P>
<P>
Troy returns to his recliner. VA tells Michelle that a contract
counselor who visits rural counties will be in touch to schedule
time with Troy. Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry
the next day.
</P>
<P>
The Turners decide to pack up and leave their $475-a-month rental
house for a $450-a-month mobile home in Moorefield to save money
and be near Troy's mother for help. They are strained beyond
belief. Still, there are moments of gallows humor. "I have PTSD,
what's your excuse?" Troy kids Michelle.
</P>
<P>
"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
</P>
<P>
Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days
parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
Troy declines. It's not just the crowds.
</P>
<P>
"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he
says.
</P>
<P>
Michelle raises an eyebrow. "It's still an injury."
</P>
<P>
"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a
psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
"Plus, the fact that guys are missing arms and have bullet holes
and everything else. Ain't a scratch on me."
</P>
<P>
To remember who Troy used to be, Michelle keeps a photo of him
hidden in her camera case. In the picture he is smiling and
eager, ruggedly at home in his Army fatigues. Now she looks at
the man in the recliner. "It's people like you that made our
country," Michelle says. She goes back to filling out forms, and
Troy goes back to Nickelodeon.
