Two four-metre (12-foot) medium-range missiles have been found at
the southern Italian port of Bari stashed among crates of oranges
in a truck bound for Germany, police said Tuesday.

The lorry's two German drivers -- as well as contacts at their
destination -- were being questioned after the American-made
AMRAAM air-to-air weapons docked from Greece aboard a German-
registered vehicle.

"Two (delivery) documents, instead of one, (going to) two
different German towns, were found on the lorry," said local
police chief Giuseppe Ialacqua after a customs inspection
revealed the unlicensed cargo.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, typically fired as a guided missile from one
aircraft with the aim of destroying another aircraft, had been
stripped of their explosive charges.
