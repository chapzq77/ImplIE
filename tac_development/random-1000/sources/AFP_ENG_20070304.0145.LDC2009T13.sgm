US Cherokees vote to expel descendants of slaves
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Native American Cherokees voted to expel descendants of black
slaves from their tribe nation in a special election that has
prompted charges of racism, according to returns made public
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent, the Cherokee Nation in
Oklahoma adopted Saturday an amendment to their constitution that
strips membership from so- called "Freedmen," those descended
from slaves once owned by Cherokees, blacks who were married to
Cherokees and children of mixed-race families.
</P>
<P>
"The Cherokee people exercised the most basic democratic right,
the right to vote," Chad Smith, Principal Chief of the Cherokee
Nation, said in a statement. "Their voice is clear as to who
should be citizens of the Cherokee Nation. No one else has the
right to make that determination."
</P>
<P>
However, opponents of the amendment say it was a racist project
designed to deny the distribution of US government funds and
tribal revenue to those with African-American heritage, US media
reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad chapter in Cherokee history," Taylor Keen, a
Cherokee tribal council member who opposes the amendment, told
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
"But this is not my Cherokee Nation. My Cherokee Nation is one
that honors all parts of her past."
</P>
<P>
Advocates of changing the 141-year-old treaty rules defining who
is a Cherokee say the tribal nation has a sovereign right to
decide citizenship and that other tribes base membership on blood
lines.
</P>
<P>
The Cherokee Nation, which ranks as the second-largest tribe
behind the Navajo, has some 250,000 to 270,000 members and is
growing rapidly. Members are entitled to benefits from the US
federal government and tribal services, including medical and
housing aid and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Cherokees, along with several other tribes, held black slaves and
allied themselves with the Confederacy during the US civil war.
After the war, the federal government in an 1866 treaty ordered
the slaves freed.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Cherokee Nation expelled many descendants of slaves
as members but a Cherokee tribunal ruled last year that the
Freedmen were fully-fledged citizens with voting rights. That
court decision prompted Saturday's special vote.
</P>
<P>
Native American tribes recognized by the United States government
have the right to self-determination and authority similar to US
states.
</P>
<P>
Election results will remain unofficial until certified by the
Cherokee Nation Election Commission, but officials said
percentages were not expected to change significantly.
