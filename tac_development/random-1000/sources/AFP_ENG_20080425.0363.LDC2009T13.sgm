Russia listens to human rights criticism: Putin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin on Friday told a top European human
rights representative just back from Chechnya that Russia took
criticism of its rights record seriously."I think you will have
noticed we are trying to react to the previous remarks of your
colleagues. Maybe not everything has worked out, but this makes
your trip more valuable," Putin told the Council of Europe's
human rights commissioner, Thomas Hammarberg, at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg was at the end of a week-long visit that took in
Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia in the troubled North Caucasus
region, where Russian forces are accused of massive human rights
violations in their long-running conflict with local guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe has frequently censured Russia for its
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Although heavy fighting is rare now, skirmishes remain frequent
and up to 5,000 Chechens are missing -- many of them feared
kidnapped and murdered, human rights organisations and officials
say.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg also met with Putin's successor, Dmitry Medvedev, who
is to be inaugurated on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gunmen in Ingushetia wounded two policemen and killed
the brother of a local politician in separate attacks, Interfax
news agency reported, quoting police.
