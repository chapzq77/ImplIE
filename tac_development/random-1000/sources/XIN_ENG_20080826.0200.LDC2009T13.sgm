PRAGUE, Aug. 26 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Czech republic reiterated its support for Georgia's
territorial integrity in reaction to Russia' s recognition of two
Georgian pro-Russian regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as
independent states, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic considered the recognition of South Ossetia
and Abkhazia as independent states an "attack on Georgia's
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said after a meeting with
President Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday that he disagreed with Russia's
recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government of Prime Minister Topolanek has backed
Georgia in the recent conflict over South Ossetia. Last week it
condemned the Russian operation in Georgia and supported Georgian
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
Topolanek said that the Czech Republic supports the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Georgia, including
South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
However, President Vaclav Klaus said it was Georgia that was
responsible for the Russia-Georgia conflict.
