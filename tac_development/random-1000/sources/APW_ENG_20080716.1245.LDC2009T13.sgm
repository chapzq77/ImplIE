Police pose as pedestrians to nab motorists who fail to yield

<P>
So why did officer Grace Delgado try to cross the road? To remind
motorists that they must stop whenever someone steps off the curb
into a crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual undercover operation, Delgado posed as a pedestrian
on a busy street while fellow officers waited for drivers to
barrel past her in violation of a law that requires them yield at
crosswalks, even if there is no stop sign.
</P>
<P>
Chicago this year joined a growing number of big cities and small
towns that are sending officers into traffic to make motorists
pay more attention to pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
"People, they don't care," said Delgado, whose bright pink
baseball hat and orange blouse made her especially tough to miss.
"It's 'Get out of my way.' The whole mentality is 'Get out of my
way.'"
</P>
<P>
With Delgado's help, police stopped 78 vehicles in just two hours
and told them they'd violated a law that's been on the books for
years. That number easily could have been doubled, but officers
stopped only drivers who kept moving after Delgado had walked
four or five feet into the road.
</P>
<P>
When they were pulled over, motorists offered all kinds of
explanations: One saw the pedestrian in the crosswalk but hadn't
heard about the law requiring him to stop. Another knew about the
law but didn't see the pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,800 pedestrians were killed and 61,000 injured in 2006,
according to the most recent statistics compiled by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In Chicago alone, 65
pedestrians have died annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths has dropped, but there is concern those
numbers could climb again as more vehicles hit the road, and the
elderly population skyrockets.
</P>
<P>
"We're beginning to see a healthy desire of older folks to remain
active and go out for their daily walks," said Doug Hecox,
spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. "That, along
with more cars ... is a recipe for danger."
</P>
<P>
Some communities already are seeing more walkers because of the
slow economy.
</P>
<P>
"The way gas prices are, people are rediscovering their feet,"
said Pam Fischer, highway traffic safety director in New Jersey,
which recently launched a "Cops in the Crosswalks" program.
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the
law, then sent relieved drivers on their way. But police
understand that the only thing more effective than a lecture from
a police officer is a lecture and a ticket.
</P>
<P>
"If there's really no threat of getting a ticket for it, you're
not going to really pay attention," said officer Chuck Trendle,
who was working with Delgado.
</P>
<P>
In Essex County, New Jersey, authorities "tried the educational
route for years," said Paul Loriquet, spokesman for the
prosecutor's office. "But until you hit somebody in the wallet,
it doesn't stick."
</P>
<P>
The threat of a ticket seemed to work in Bellingham, Washington.
After the city started a police-decoy program in 2002, the
percentage of drivers who yielded to pedestrians rose at least 25
percent -- even at corners where tickets were not being issued.
</P>
<P>
In St. Petersburg, Florida, the results were even more
impressive. The percentage of motorists who yielded to
pedestrians jumped from 2 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2007,
after police began writing tickets, educating the public and
installing flashing beacons. Pedestrian crashes dropped 17
percent between 2005 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
"It starts putting pedestrians on their radar," said Ron Van
Houten, a Western Michigan University psychology professor who
has studied pedestrian safety and trained officers around the
nation, including Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Police say undercover pedestrians will focus attention on
crosswalk safety the same way that giving tickets for seat belt
violations convinced more people to buckle up in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, people get it," Trendle said.
