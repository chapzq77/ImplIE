Britain seeks to defuse Egypt pope search row
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Britain's ambassador to Egypt met with Coptic Pope Shenuda III on
Tuesday in a bid to defuse an escalating row after authorities at
London's Heathrow airport tried to search the Orthodox
pontiff."We have the highest respect, esteem and affection for
Pope Shenuda," an embassy statement quoted ambassador Dominic
Asquith as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said on Sunday it would step up airport security procedures
for British officials after airport authorities tried to
physically search Shenuda, 84, who has a diplomatic passport,
before he boarded his flight.
</P>
<P>
He was not physically searched but was "forced to go through a
metal detector," Egypt's Deputy Foreign Minister Wafa Bassim told
the Shura Council, the upper house of Egypt's parliament, earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador said: "There has been no intention at all
to offend His Holiness or make him upset. We regret any other
impressions that might have been deduced."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's official MENA news agency said Asquith called on Shenuda
"to apologise for the insult made against him ... when security
authorities insisted on searching him in defiance of standard
protocols."
</P>
<P>
Shura speaker Sawfat al-Sherif had demanded an official apology
from the British government.
