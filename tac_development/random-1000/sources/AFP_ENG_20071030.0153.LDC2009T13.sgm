Norway said Tuesday it would donate 130 million kroner (17
million euros, 24 million dollars) to help protect the Amazon
rain forest, the deforestation of which is leading to rising
greenhouse gas emissions.

<P>
Norwegian Environment and Development Aid Minister Erik Solheim
announced the donation, to be paid over three years, following
talks in Oslo with his Brazilian counterpart Marina Silva.

<P>
"The felling and burning of tropical forests is a significant
cause of greenhouse gases," Solheim said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The actions necessary to put an end to deforestation will be an
important theme during the upcoming climate talks in Bali in
December," he added.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation currently accounts for 20 percent of global carbon
dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Bali conference, to be held from December 3 to 14, is tasked
with setting a negotiation roadmap for a new deal on deepening
emissions cuts when commitments run out under the Kyoto Protocol
in 2012.

<P>
Norway will contribute 60 million kroner to two projects run by
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and an
additional 70 million kroner to a special rain forest fund.

According to Brazilian authorities, 27,429 square kilometers of
Amazon rain forest were destroyed between August 2003 and July
2004.
</P>
<P>
Between August 2006 and July 2007, after the government adopted
measures to protect the forest, the rate of deforestation slowed
to 9,600 square kilometers.
