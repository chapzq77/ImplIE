European Scientists Seek Cause of Spacecraft Glitch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of
four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late
Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the European Space Agency said all other systems
on the state-of-the-art spacecraft were working well following
its launch from the agency's base in South America, and they did
not expect the engine problem to keep the transport, named the
Jules Verne, from docking with the space station next month.
</P>
<P>
The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour
for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning. The shuttle is
carrying up part of a Japanese-made laboratory that will
ultimately join labs produced by the United States, Russia and
the European Space Agency that are already attached to the
orbiting station.
</P>
<P>
Japanese astronaut Takao Doi is one of seven astronauts on the
shuttle flight, which is transporting parts of the Kibo
laboratory as well as a Canadian-built two-armed robotic system
called Dextre.
</P>
<P>
The planned 16-day shuttle mission, the longest so far to the
space station, is part of a concerted effort by NASA to finish
assembly of the long-delayed space station by September 2010, at
which point the three space shuttles will be retired.
</P>
<P>
The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry
astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and
the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part
of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year
gap. NASA will have to rely on the Russian space agency to do
most of the ferrying of astronauts and cargo to and from the
station.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans' Jules Verne, which is carrying 4.6 tons of cargo,
is the first of six transport launches the Europeans promised as
their contribution to the space station effort. The vehicle has
taken almost a decade to develop and launch.
</P>
<P>
ESA spokesman Franco Bonacino said that the shutdown of one of
the transport's engines was done automatically shortly after the
spacecraft reached orbit and was associated with a pressure
imbalance in the jumble of pipes and valves leading from the fuel
tanks to the thrusters.
</P>
<P>
Bonacino said that researchers and engineers were working to fix
the problem from mission control in Toulouse, France, and that
the problem did not appear to pose any serious threat to the
mission. Even if it cannot be fixed, he said, the transport will
still be able to dock with the space station.
</P>
<P>
That docking cannot take place, however, until the shuttle
Endeavour has arrived and departed -- more than two weeks from
Tuesday. With that much time to work on the problem, European
space agency officials said they expected to be able to fix it.
</P>
<P>
About half of the Jules Verne's payload is propellant for use by
rockets that periodically push the space station higher to
compensate for the natural decay of its orbit. The rest is
oxygen, drinking water and dry goods.
</P>
<P>
After spending four months docked to the station, the transport
will carry away waste and will burn up in the atmosphere as the
transport plunges to Earth over the southern Pacific Ocean. The
Japanese space agency is also developing a space station
transport, as are two private American companies working with
NASA.
</P>
<P>
The Jules Verne is the first automated spacecraft designed to
dock with the station in full compliance with the tight safety
constraints imposed after the 2003 space shuttle Columbia
disaster.
