Jitters as US consumer inflation jumps by Jitendra Joshi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US consumer prices jumped in January, the government reported
Wednesday, a week after Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned
that inflation remains the central bank's top concern.
</P>
<P>
The data spooked some pundits and Wall Street investors who had
hoped that receding inflation could set the stage for a Fed rate
cut sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
"The CPI news takes some of the wind out of the excessively
optimistic 'Goldilocks' forecast of moderate economic growth with
low inflation," Briefing.com equity analyst Dick Green said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2
percent last month compared to December on surging food and
medical costs. The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food
and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, the headline consumer price index was up
2.1 percent and the core CPI rose 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's official forecast calls for core inflation to be in a
range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent for 2007. That is slightly above
what economists see as the central bank's "comfort zone" of under
2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has held its headline interest rate at 5.25 percent since
August, highlighting signs of US economic acceleration along with
an easing of inflation pressures at its last meeting in January.
</P>
<P>
But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that
inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
</P>
<P>
"In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way,
inflation needs to be well controlled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal
Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates."
</P>
<P>
And minutes from the January 31 meeting of the Fed's policy
committee, released Wednesday, showed that Bernanke and his
colleagues "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as
definitively established."
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
"Following three consecutive months at 0.1 percent, at first
sight, the jump in January core consumer price inflation seems to
signal renewed inflationary vigor," Global Insight US economist
Kenneth Beauchemin said.
</P>
<P>
"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large
0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest
such reading since August 1991," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the
core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's
preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the
second half of the year."
</P>
<P>
Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up
also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April
2005.
</P>
<P>
But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice
and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that
inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are some strange elements in it but you cannot simply
exclude the ones you don't like in the months that don't come out
the way you like it."
</P>
<P>
Naroff cautioned that "investors should not assume that inflation
has gone away," as blue-chip US shares sold off on the CPI news.
</P>
<P>
"And investors should start asking what they should expect for
long-term inflation. Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent
to 2.0 percent are likely too low."
</P>
<P>
In other news Wednesday, the private-sector Conference Board said
its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of activity in
the coming six to nine months, rose just 0.1 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
But the December reading was revised up to 0.6 percent.
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said the US economy and
consumer demand had proved "resilient" to high energy prices and
a housing slump.
