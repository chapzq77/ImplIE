BIOTECHS SEEING THE FUTURE IN START-UPS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like other major biotechnology companies, Biogen Idec Inc. has a
cadre of talented scientists working feverishly to discover
breakthrough drugs. Over the years, the Cambridge biotech has
also made acquisitions, established a $105 million venture fund,
and licensed promising technologies to build a pipeline of
potential life-saving therapies.
</P>
<P>
Now, Biogen Idec is trying a new approach: setting up an
incubator to help biotech start-ups get off the ground by
providing them with funding, technical expertise, and office and
laboratory space near its Kendall Square headquarters.
</P>
<P>
After spending more than a year getting the incubator ready,
Biogen Idec plans to disclose Wednesdaythat it has signed up its
first tenant, Escoublac, a new company based on research from a
Columbia University researcher. It hopes to unveil its second
tenant next month.
</P>
<P>
"We felt we needed to pursue another mechanism" to support early-
stage companies, said Rainer Fuchs, executive director of the
Biogen Idec Innovation Incubator.
</P>
<P>
As the biotech revolution matures, Biogen Idec and other
companies are trying to find creative ways to get in on the
ground floor of promising research developed outside their
laboratories. A few, like Biogen Idec, are setting up corporate
incubators. Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant, recently
committed to spending up to $10 million a year on a new biotech
incubator in La Jolla, Calif., near San Diego, and is considering
setting up another incubator in Massachusetts or another biotech
hot spot.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge said it is considering
stepping up investments in young companies or setting up an
incubator of its own.
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to be able to identify opportunities at an early
stage," said Alan Walts, managing director of Genzyme Ventures.
"We've been actively considering ideas on how we might establish
some form of incubator complex."
</P>
<P>
Others are using a different strategy.
</P>
<P>
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans Wednesday to say it has struck
an unusual deal with Harvard University to fund research projects
related to cancer, infectious diseases, and other areas Vertex is
interested in - with few strings attached. The Cambridge biotech
company said Harvard researchers will be able to publish their
results freely and retain the rights to any technology they
develop - something barred by some corporate research funders.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Vertex chief executive Joshua Boger, who earned his
doctorate in chemistry at Harvard, said he hopes the project will
help his company begin a "dialogue" with Harvard researchers
working in areas that could be useful to Vertex's development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and
decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a
total of several million dollars over three years. If Harvard
decides to license any technology developed, Vertex said it has
the option to license it first. "It's a new model," Boger said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fuchs said Biogen Idec hopes to house up to four or
five companies in its biotech incubator within two years. But
Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
</P>
<P>
He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before
settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center
professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone
biology and metabolism. The company hopes to pioneer new
treatments for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and
obesity, which have been on the increase in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fuchs said Biogen Idec plans to give each company in its
incubator between $3 million and $10 million in seed funding over
several years, dedicated office and laboratory space,
administrative support, and technical expertise. In return,
Biogen Idec will receive stock in the companies and an option to
eventually buy the rest at a prenegotiated price.
</P>
<P>
Two local venture capitalists were enthusiastic about Biogen
Idec's endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a big fan of what they are doing," said Terry McGuire,
managing general partner of Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham.
"There's always a shortage of capital for the early stage stuff."
</P>
<P>
Peter Feinstein, general partner of BioVentures Investors in
Cambridge, said he thought Biogen Idec could help invigorate its
research programs by bringing in entrepreneurs with new ideas.
</P>
<P>
"It like having puppies around an older dog," Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
Walts, however, said one concern with a corporate incubator is
that it could hurt start-ups' ability to work with other drug
companies. So, he said, Genzyme is considering setting up a
"virtual incubator" instead. Genzyme would provide seed funding
and technical support to new ventures, but would not physically
house the companies on its property. That way, the companies
might be better able to forge their own identities.
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Walts said, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Vertex share a
common goal: finding new ways to tap into early-stage drug
research.
</P>
<P>
But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which
approach works best.
