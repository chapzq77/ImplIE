European new car sales continue to go downhill
</HEADLINE>

<P>
New car sales in Europe fell for the fourth consecutive month in
May, dragged down by a poor showing in western Europe despite
strong performance further east, the European automobile
association ACEA said Wednesday
</P>
<P>
Registrations of new passenger cars in Europe -- comprising the
EU members except Cyprus and Malta, plus Iceland, Norway and
Switzerland -- totalled 1,442,518 in May, 1.6 percent down on the
figures a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"New EU member states showed a constant upward trend (11.1
percent) while Western Europe deepened its loss (-2.4 percent),"
the ACEA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The German car market, the biggest in Europe, was particularly
weak, with registrations, dropping 11.1 percent over the period
and continuing a downward trend since a sales tax hike at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The French and British markets were also down, by 2.8 percent and
2.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Union's newest member states, mostly former
communist countries in eastern Europe, continued their upward
trend for the fifth month running, with Lithuania (57.1 percent),
Slovakia (35.7 percent and Romania (29.8 percent) leading the
way, despite considerable percentage falls in Hungary, Slovakia
and, to a lesser extent, the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Among the major brands, Europe's leading carmaker VW Group saw
sales ease 2.5 percent in May over one year while France's PSA
Group, the second-biggest European carmaker, saw sales rise a
healthy 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
US carmakers Ford saw sales fall 1.1 percent, after a hike the
previous month, while GM fared worse with an 8.9 percent fall in
May following a 4.7 percent fall in April.
</P>
<P>
Fiat's recovery after several lean years continued to gather
steam as its sales surged 5.7 percent while the Renault group's
sales continued to tumble, losing 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's figures took a dip, falling 2.6 percent in May, while
German luxury car maker DaimlerChrysler saw sales rise 2.0
percent and rival BMW saw an increase of 5.2 percent.
