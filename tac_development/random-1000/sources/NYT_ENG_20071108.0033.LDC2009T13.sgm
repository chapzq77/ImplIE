WALTON MAY BE ODD-MAN OUT WHEN ODOM RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EL SEGUNDO, Calif.
</P>
<P>
The expected return of Lamar Odom to the Lakers' starting lineup
Friday will send one of his teammates to the bench, and the smart
money seems to be on forward Luke Walton.
</P>
<P>
Barring any last-minute setbacks, Odom, who underwent shoulder
surgery in May, will play Friday. Last season, Odom partnered
with Walton in the starting frontcourt, but that could change
now.
</P>
<P>
"I know, but you don't," coach Phil Jackson said after practice
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In response to separate questions, however, Jackson said Walton
would "be really good to help that second team, too" and praised
the effort of Ronny Turiaf, who has started each of the first
four games.
</P>
<P>
"There's some things Ronny is doing that are very good," Jackson
said. "His energy is good. Sustaining it is not easy for him.
It's a lot of work, and he's not in the kind of condition yet
that he can sustain that, so it's great to have Lamar coming
back, who can come in and play a couple different positions."
</P>
<P>
Jackson did indicate that Odom would start, rather than ease his
way back into the lineup as a reserve. Walton, a reserve in his
first three seasons, started all 60 games in which he appeared
last season.
</P>
<P>
Odom, who led the Lakers in rebounding last season and was second
in points and assists per game, went though his most physical
practice to date and pronounced himself ready to return to game
action.
</P>
<P>
Odom said he didn't fear that the shoulder would impact him
physically and wasn't concerned that he would think about it
while on the court.
</P>
<P>
"I go all out," Odom said. "That's how I play. It's the college
football mentality, right? Just go out there. We're athletes, so
we have to play in pain sometimes. It took me some time to come
back from this injury but I feel like I'm ready."
</P>
<P>
WALKING WOUNDED: Kwame Brown (right-heel bursitis) and Maurice
Evans (lower-back pain) did not practice. Evans is unlikely to
play Friday and Brown's status remains day to day, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Brown received electronic-stimulation treatment near the end of
practice, then hobbled off the court.
</P>
<P>
DECISION TIME FOR JACKSON: Still uncertain is whether Jackson
will return beyond this season. The Lakers have a standing
contract extension on the table, and Jackson said he will make
his decision soon.
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be before Thanksgiving, or around Thanksgiving
time," Jackson said. "That's a good time period."
</P>
<P>
Jackson has maintained that health, along with the Lakers'
chances of being a championship contender, will determine his
future.
</P>
<P>
Jackson periodically uses a cane to walk, five-plus months after
his second hip-replacement surgery. Jackson said "things are
going very positive for me" but said he wants to see how he feels
after a longer road trip before he makes a decision.
</P>
<P>
"I've yet to experience a two-game road trip, or something like
that, to just know that I can get out of bed, get my clothes on
and make it to breakfast in the morning," Jackson said.
