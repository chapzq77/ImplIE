Afghan and NATO-led troops battled with Taliban militants and
called in airstrikes in a series of clashes in the country's
south that left 40 insurgents dead, an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The joint force clashed with militants in the mountainous Shah
Wali Kot district in Kandahar province during a three-day
operation that ended Saturday and left 35 insurgents dead, said
provincial police chief Sayed Agha Saqib.
</P>
<P>
Ten other insurgents were detained near the militants'
mountainous hide-outs, which they used to launch attacks against
Afghan and foreign troops in the area, Saqib said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities recovered the militants' bodies along with their
automatic weapons and ammunition, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Kandahar's Zhari district, Afghan and foreign troops clashed
with another group of militants hiding in a compound Saturday
night, killing five militants and detaining four others, Saqib
said.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed was a regional militant commander, Mullah
Faizullah, he said.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties among Afghan or foreign troops during
the operations, Saqib said.
</P>
<P>
The reports could not be independently verified because the areas
are remote and inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
This year has been the most violent since the U.S.-led invasion
of Afghanistan in 2001. Insurgency-related violence has claimed
nearly 6,200 lives, according to a tally of figures from Afghan
and Western officials.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that
current plans to have a 70,000-member Afghan army by the end of
2008 will not be sufficient to ensure the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
"We think that an army of 200,000 troops is in the best interest
of both Afghanistan and the international community," said Gen.
Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The current plan for troop numbers was set before the Taliban-led
insurgency engulfed the country and is not adequate, Azimi said.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Afghan army soldiers and 75,000 police have been
trained so far, with plans to create a 70,000-member army and
82,000-strong police force by the end of 2008.
</P>
<P>
Training and equipping of the Afghan army and police are a key
element of the Western strategy of ensuring stability in the
country and allowing the drawdown of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50,000 foreign troops in the country,
including U.S.-led coalition and NATO-led forces.
