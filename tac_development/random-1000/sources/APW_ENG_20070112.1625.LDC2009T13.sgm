Companies still might eke out double-digit gains, despite what
naysayers claim

NEW YORK 2007-01-12 21:10:49 UTC
</P>
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and several other major companies
issued warnings this past week that fourth-quarter results will
miss expectations. Wall Street barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, analysts have said the long period of stellar earnings
growth might be over for U.S. companies, that the 18 straight
quarters of double-digit profit growth for Standard &amp; Poor's
500 companies will be replaced by more modest results.
</P>
<P>
But investors remain upbeat as hundreds of companies are set to
report results in the next few weeks. Shareholders did not go
screaming for the exits Friday after AMD, business software maker
SAP AG and Murphy's Oil Corp. warned results will miss
expectations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Dow Jones industrials hit a record close. And
analysts say there are signs that companies might have been able
to eke out double-digit gains during the last three months of
2006.
</P>
<P>
"There is an indication that the overall quarter might turn out
to be better than expected," said David Dropsey, a research
analyst with Thomson Financial that tracks equities. "Earnings
are still strong coming out of a lot of sectors."
</P>
<P>
For instance, there's an old adage on Wall Street that "as goes
Alcoa, goes the market." The world's biggest aluminum maker,
which reported its results Wednesday said profits soared 60
percent from a year earlier, and it had a 20 percent jump in
revenue that pushed past analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, 31 S&amp;P 500 components reported earnings.
There were 17 companies that beat expectations, six that met them
and eight that reported results below projections. That matches
the historical averages, Dropsey said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 companies, those that have beaten expectations have
done so by an average of 8 percent. This is still well above the
norm of a 3 percent rise, according to Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
Measuring the pace of profit warnings has also been a good way to
judge how the quarter will turn out.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, 156 companies pre-announced results -- 37 said
they'd be above projections, 26 said they were in line with
estimates, and 93 announced they would miss.
</P>
<P>
Even adding AMD and other recent warnings, Wall Street is still
faring slightly better than it did in the third quarter. During
that period, 177 pre-announced -- 53 said they would beat
expectations, 23 said they'd be in line, and 101 said they'd
miss.
</P>
<P>
Although these are extremely early indicators, it suggests the
fourth quarter remains on par with the previous quarter. Although
many on Wall Street don't expect profit growth to hit the 22
percent level seen in the S&amp;P 500 during the third quarter,
it is still expected to blow past the historical average of 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio managers say what has come out so far hasn't been
significantly negative or positive, and that double-digit growth
is still achievable.
</P>
<P>
"I'd be more concerned if you saw multiple warnings from the same
industry," said Matt Kelmon, portfolio manager of the Kelmoore
Strategy Funds. "Every quarter for the past 18 quarters we've
been waiting for this earnings slowdown, and it's just never
come. It might be a headline if it's not double digit, but we're
still seeing really strong profits anyway."
</P>
<P>
Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global
Investments, said investors aren't shaken by the recent warnings.
He still sees resilient corporate earnings on the way.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations for profit growth already were ratcheted down,
but we're now seeing some leeway in that," he said. "Even if you
have a few of these disappointments like with AMD, that's still
not enough to change expectations that profit will decelerate
below expectations."
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;P 500, considered to be one of the broadest indicators
of how the market as a whole is performing, is an index weighted
by how many shares are traded in each company. That means the
potential for sharp growth in the index as a whole could come
from a few key sectors, like financial services stocks, Dropsey
said.
</P>
<P>
Already, major U.S. investment banks and mutual fund companies
that reported in December have shown record-breaking results.
Property and casualty insurers might also surprise Wall Street
because of the quiet hurricane period this year.
</P>
<P>
There's even the possibility of decent earnings coming from the
nation's biggest automakers. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. -- both big members of the index -- could post stronger-than-
expected results considering recent restructurings.
</P>
<P>
"These areas have the potential for surprise," Dropsey said.
