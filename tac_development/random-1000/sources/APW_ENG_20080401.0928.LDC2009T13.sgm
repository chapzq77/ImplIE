Gunmen fired on a car carrying foreign workers and abducted a
Briton and a Kenyan in southern Somalia on Tuesday, officials and
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Local resident Mohamed Mumin said he saw six armed men open fire
on the car as it approached them on the road.
</P>
<P>
"I could see a white man running out of the vehicle with blood on
his leg. I don't know whether he was injured or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The driver of the car told us that gunmen riding in a covered
car have showered the aid workers' car with machine-gun fires,
injuring the British man in the leg," added local clan leader
Mohamed Marbuc Aden, who had met with the two men a day earlier.
"They ordered Somalis in the car to alight and sped off with the
two foreigners."

<P>
The local commissioner of Buale town, Ibrahim Noleye, identified
the two men as a Briton and Kenyan who worked in his region. He
said they were seized as they traveled between Buale and Sikow in
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said the two workers
seized in the incident do not work for the Rome-based agency, as
earlier reports said, but were contractors for Genesys
International Corp. Ltd., a survey and engineering company based
in Bangalore, India.
</P>
<P>
The company was contracted by the FAO to carry out aerial surveys
to prepare detailed maps needed to assist people affected by the
regular flooding of two rivers in the area, said Erwin Northoff,
a spokesman for the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
"We are supporting any efforts to make sure they will be
released," Northoff said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Middle Juba region, Hajir Bile Sugal, told
The Associated Press that the government has dispatched soldiers
to a village near Buale where he heard the gunmen had fled.
</P>
<P>
"The kidnappers are clan militiamen and the hunt to release the
aid workers and capture criminals is ongoing."
</P>
<P>
Lawless Somalia has not had a functioning government since 1991,
when rival warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and
then turned on each other. Over a million of its citizens depend
on foreign aid, but there have been a number of attacks on aid
workers in previous months, including kidnappings and land mines
which have blown up their vehicles.
