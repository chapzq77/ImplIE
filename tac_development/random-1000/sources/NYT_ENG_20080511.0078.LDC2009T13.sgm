ANOTHER DISTURBING ROADBLOCKTHIS ROADBLOCK IS DISTURBING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CLEVELAND - They were kings of the road. Now they are road kill.
And it's giving their fans road rage.
</P>
<P>
Celtics fans figured this was the night the team would revert to
their green jersey dominance of the regular season. Hub hoop
junkies witnessed the ease of a Game 2 victory at TD Banknorth
Garden and concluded that the real Celtics were ready to take it
to the streets of Cleveland. No more of the nonsense that plagued
them for three long nights in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
And then the game started and Boston's swagger and superiority
evaporated. Again. The Celtics didn't show up. They got run out
of the gym, 108-84, last night by the same team that couldn't
score 75 points in the New Garden. It was the Celtics' most
lopsided loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't about LeBron James this time. The King carried his
shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor). But it didn't
matter because the Cavaliers ran away from the Celtics long
before halftime. It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the
second. The Celtics never got closer than 12 after intermission.
</P>
<P>
Boston's no-show included taking only two free throws in the
first half, which ended with the Cavaliers leading, 52-35. Paul
Pierce took eight shots all night. Ray Allen shot 4 for 12. Point
guard Rajon Rondo had zero assists in 23 minutes. Cleveland has
the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier
attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers. "I
thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the
game. In every way they beat us tonight. They outcoached us, they
played harder, they got the loose balls. We were not comfortable.
We didn't make plays. Instead of being the solid defensive team
that we've been, I thought we got down because our offense wasn't
going."
</P>
<P>
This makes the Green 6-0 at home and 0-4 on the road in this
postseason. Though it is technically possible for the Celtics to
win the championship if this continues, the hot-cold, home-away
dynamic does little to inspire confidence. This caliber of play
is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or
Hornets.
</P>
<P>
So the same questions will be asked before the Celtics play Game
4 here tomorrow night. The questions will be asked again and
again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Strange. These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road
this season. They swept through Texas, which is virtually
impossible in today's NBA. And now they are neutralized and
intimidated by the likes of Philips Arena and Quicken Loans
Arena. What gives?
</P>
<P>
"This is the NBA," said Rivers. "Nothing surprises me in this
league. Did I think this would happen? No. But it did happen. So
now we just have to get ready for Monday night."
</P>
<P>
Asked to account for the home-road disparity, Rivers said, "I
can't. But we have to find out why."
</P>
<P>
"We definitely took our lumps tonight," admitted Pierce. "We're
going to come out better in Game 4. We've got to come out to a
better start."
</P>
<P>
When Pierce was asked if he was worried, he said, "A little bit.
I'm disappointed. We've got to be a lot more aggressive. We've
got to be aggressive on the road."
</P>
<P>
This was never a game. Cleveland's Ben Wallace recovered from his
Game 2 vapors and made his first three shots as the Cavaliers
bolted to a 22-8 lead. That's a 14-point lead. I know this only
because the overhead scoreboard at The Q offers a moronic feature
entitled "The Diff." When it was 22-8, The Diff was 14. Thanks.
(Wonder if there are any hockey or soccer scoreboards that offer
The Diff?)
</P>
<P>
It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics
were hoping to avoid.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to come out in the first quarter and put up a better
fight," said Celtics guard Sam Cassell.
</P>
<P>
"We refused to play together offensively," said Rivers. "And
that's the thing that alarms me from Atlanta. They got a lot of
the offensive rebounds. But that's hustle. We have to do better."
</P>
<P>
There is cause for concern. This is a little more than a home-
road thing. It feels like the Celtics are being exposed. Pierce
and Allen have not been the same players they were during the
regular season. Rondo looks lost. The team that won 66 games
hasn't demonstrated the fortitude of a champion. They lost only
16 games during the regular season, never by as many as 20. Now
they are 0-4 on the road in the playoffs and smarting from a
24-point beating.
</P>
<P>
Time for somebody to step forward. Time for the Celtics to show
up in a game played outside the Garden.
