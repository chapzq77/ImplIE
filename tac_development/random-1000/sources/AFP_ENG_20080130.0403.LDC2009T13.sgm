<P>
US aerospace giant Boeing said Wednesday full-year net profit
soared 84 percent to a record 4.07 billion dollars, beating
market expectations, despite flat sales in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the company warned that delays in its new 787 Dreamliner
program would weigh on its earnings in 2008.
</P>
<P>
For the full year 2007, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were
5.28 dollars on higher commercial aircraft deliveries, strong
growth in defense earnings, productivity gains and other factors,
Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
That compared with 2006 net profit of 2.2 billion dollars and
2.85 dollars earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said that fourth-quarter net profit rose four percent to
1.03 billion dollars from the same period in 2006, with earnings
per share at 1.36 dollars. In 2006, profit was 989 million
dollars, or 1.29 dollars a share.
</P>
<P>
The results exceeded analysts' consensus forecast for earnings
per share of 5.22 dollars for 2007 and 1.32 dollars in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Revenue was virtually flat in the three months ended December 31,
rising to 17.48 billion dollars from 17.54 billion in the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Dow component, citing earlier than expected productivity
gains, lifted its outlook for fiscal 2008 to earnings of between
5.70 dollars and 5.85 dollars a share.
</P>
<P>
However, the company lowered its revenue outlook for 2008, to a
range of 67 billion dollars to 68 billion, reflecting a
previously disclosed delay in its new 787 Dreamliner program. The
prior forecast was for revenue of 67.5 billion dollars to 68.5
billion for the year.
</P>
<P>
It sees operating cash flow of greater than 2.5 billion dollars
for 2008, a reduction from a previous outlook of greater than
three billion dollars, again because of the 787 delay.
</P>
<P>
The company said the outlook for its defense business and in-
production commercial airplane programs remains "very strong" for
2009 and it continues to expect strong earnings per share growth
for the year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said its total company backlog as of December 31 stood at
327 billion dollars, up 31 percent year-over-year, because of
commercial airplane orders and defense program wins.
