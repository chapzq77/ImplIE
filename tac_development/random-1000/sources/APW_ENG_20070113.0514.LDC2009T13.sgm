Japanese agricultural officials on Saturday identified the strain
of the bird flu virus that caused the deaths of thousands of
chickens at a poultry farm in southern Japan as belonging to the
broad H5 family.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet clear, however, whether the virus was the H5N1
strain, according to Miyazaki prefectural (state) agricultural
official Masao Tanaka. H5N1 has killed 157 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
At least 2,400 chickens have died since Wednesday at a farm in
the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki prefecture (state), and
prefectural officials were conducting bird flu tests. By
Saturday, the death toll has risen to 3,800, public broadcaster
NHK said.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Animal Health near Tokyo has identified
the virus as the type-A influenza of the H5 family and is running
DNA tests to determine further details, Tanaka said.
</P>
<P>
Further epidemic prevention procedures, including sterilization
of the farm, are also under way, he added.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of the virulent H5 virus means all remaining
10,000 breeding and egg-laying chickens raised at the farm must
be culled, beginning as early as Sunday, Tanaka said.
</P>
<P>
Since 2003, the virulent H5N1 of bird flu has claimed at least
157 lives worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
There has been one confirmed human case involving the H5N1 virus
in Japan, but no reported human deaths. Japan's most recent H5N1
outbreak occurred in Kyoto in 2004. Japan has had several other
outbreaks of less virulent bird flu viruses not harmful to humans
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up a taskforce and ordered nearly 20
poultry farms within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius of the
affected operator to halt shipments of eggs and chickens for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry also ordered a nationwide inspection of
poultry farms to detect any signs of sick birds, and environment
officials began a national survey to look into the possibility
that a bird flu virus might have been brought by migratory birds
from other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Miyazaki, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is
the nation's largest poultry producing region.
