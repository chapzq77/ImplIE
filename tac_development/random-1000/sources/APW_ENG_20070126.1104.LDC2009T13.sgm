KABUL, Afghanistan 2007-01-26 15:24:04 UTC

Afghan President Hamid Karzai's wife gave birth to their first
child -- a son they named Mirwais, Karzai's spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mirwais was born Thursday evening in the capital, Kabul, and
mother Zeenat Quraishi, and son were doing fine, spokesman Karim
Rahimi said.
</P>
<P>
"God gave him a son," Rahimi said. "Karzai prayed for his son to
serve the Afghan people."
</P>
<P>
Mirwais is 49-year-old Karzai's first child, Rahimi said.
</P>
<P>
News of the birth topped the news bulletin on Afghan state TV
Friday. The newscaster congratulated the couple on their newborn
son, and thanked the doctors who delivered the baby.
</P>
<P>
Karzai and Quraishi, a medical doctor by profession, have rarely
been seen together in public in this deeply traditional and male-
dominated society, where women's and men's public domains are
kept largely separate.
</P>
<P>
The couple got engaged in late 1998 and were married in 1999,
according to Karzai's family.
</P>
<P>
Quraishi used to work as a doctor in hospitals treating Afghans
and also in Afghan refugee camps in the southwestern Pakistani
city of Quetta, where she first met Karzai.
</P>
<P>
The son's name echoes that of Mirwais Khan, an 18th century
Pashtun ruler of Kandahar, from where Karzai also hails. Pashtuns
are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mirwais was at the forefront of an 18th century Sunni Pashtun
revolt against the Shiite Safavid court, which appointed rulers
of Kandahar until then. He died peacefully in 1715 and lies in
mausoleum outside the city of Kandahar.
