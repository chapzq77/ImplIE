Two Palestinians wounded by Israeli fire in Gaza
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two Palestinian civilians were wounded by Israeli fire on Tuesday
in the northern Gaza Strip, near the border with Israel, medics
and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The army fired a rocket from just inside Israel and a drone fired
a second one into the Jabaliya area, from where Palestinian
militants had launched a home- made projectile at the Jewish
state, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army, which was not immediately available to comment
on the incident, said two rockets were fired into Israel by
militants in Gaza early Tuesday, landing without causing injuries
or damage.
</P>
<P>
The incidents were the latest violations of a November 26
ceasefire, under which the Israeli army withdrew its troops from
Gaza while Palestinian militants were to stop firing rockets into
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since then militants have fired more than 90 rockets at Israel,
with 76 of them falling inside the Jewish state. At least three
Palestinians have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire
in the coastal strip.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the latest attack on Israel, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erakat insisted on the need to respect the
ceasefire so as to avoid Israeli reprisals.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire with Israel is very important because, if Israel
resumes assassinations and arrests it will destroy any chance of
relaunching the peace process. Consequently, the ceasefire should
be preserved, because that serves Palestinian interests."
