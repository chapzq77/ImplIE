UN envoy seeks independence for Kosovo: report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari proposes independence
for the Albanian- populated Serbian province in his confidential
report, excerpts of which were quoted by the French newspaper Le
Monde on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Independence under international supervision is the only viable
option" for Kosovo, Ahtisaari said in the report that was sent to
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon last week.
</P>
<P>
According to Le Monde, Ahtisaari wrote that "maintaining an
international administration was not tenable" for Kosovo but that
its "reintegration into Serbia was not a viable option."
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to determine the status of Kosovo," said
Ahtisaari, following eight years of UN rule in the province.
</P>
<P>
"Independence offers the only guarantee against the risk" of
instability, he said. "It's also the only chance for a
sustainable partnership with Serbia."
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Kosovo would have its own constitution but would
"for an initial phase" be placed under the international
monitoring of "civilian personnel" named by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces would continue to be present at the outset and the
Serb minority would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, according to
the report quoted by Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since 1999,
when NATO bombing helped to drive out Serb forces carrying out a
brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 ethnic Albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled
Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Serbian and ethnic Albanian officials failed
to agree on future self-rule for Kosovo after more than 13 months
of UN-sponsored talks.
</P>
<P>
Members of the UN Security Council are to receive the full final
report from Ahtisaari on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council will be asked in the coming weeks to
consider the plan put forward by Ahtisaari following the failure
of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians.
