Yen gains in Asian trade on risk aversion
</HEADLINE>

The yen gained on the dollar and euro in Asian trade Thursday as
investors shunned riskier assets amid concerns about slowing US
economic growth and prospects of another US interest rate cut,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped to 114.02 yen in Tokyo morning trade from
114.24 in New York late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to 162.46 yen from 162.97 and to 1.4251 dollars
from 1.4264.
</P>
<P>
Traders' risk appetite declined in the aftermath of negative US
housing data and news of severe losses at Wall Street giant
Merrill Lynch linked to recent problems in credit markets.
</P>
<P>
The yen rose as players scaled down risky carry trades that
involve selling low- return currencies for high yielding ones,
said Yoshifumi Suzuki, forex dealer at Hachijuni Bank.

The National Association of Realtors on Wednesday reported a
steeper-than- expected eight percent slide in existing US home
sales, heightening concerns about the outlook for the world's
largest economy.

<P>
Market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will lower its
benchmark lending rate at its two-day meeting next week were also
making dollar assets less attractive, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Investors are speculating about the size of a potential rate cut
although another half-point reduction like the one seen in
September would be "a little too much since inflation concerns
remain," said Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
"But with with the US economy slowing while growth elsewhere in
the world remains resilient, the dollar will be pressured," he
added.

The Australian dollar continued to rise against the greenback
towards fresh 23-year highs amid growing expectations of further
interest rates rises by Australia's central bank due to stronger-
than-expected inflation, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to "not only hike rates
by 25 basis points in November but also look for a further 25
basis points hike to 7.0 percent in February," NAB Capital
strategist John Kyriakopoulos predicted.
