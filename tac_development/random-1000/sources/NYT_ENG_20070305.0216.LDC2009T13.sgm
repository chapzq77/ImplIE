SOLDIERS TESTIFY OVER POOR CARE AT WALTER REED
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress heard wrenching testimony on Monday from
wounded soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and
contrite promises from top Army officials to correct the
conditions there.
</P>
<P>
Two generals who had commanded Walter Reed, a premier military
hospital in Washington, accepted responsibility for the situation
faced by some wounded troops, including poor housing, neglect and
a hopelessly complicated bureaucratic maze.
</P>
<P>
The Army officials said they were working to address the problems
at Walter Reed and were examining the situation at other medical
centers.
</P>
<P>
"We have let some soldiers down," said Pete Geren, the
undersecretary of the Army, addressing the panel before the
hearing began.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an
auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were
to testify. The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop
for the hearing, the first of several that congressional
committees intend to hold.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee members heard first on Monday from two soldiers
badly hurt in the war in Iraq, and from the spouse of another
soldier injured in Iraq, about their experiences at Walter Reed.
Together, the trio's stories set the emotional tenor for the
testimony from military officials that followed.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon
described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round
from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi,
causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
</P>
<P>
Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient
treatment, he recounted.
</P>
<P>
Despite being extremely disoriented, he said, he was given a map
and told to find his own way to his new residence on the
hospital's sprawling grounds. He wandered into a building and
received directions.
</P>
<P>
He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would
contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people
himself until he reached his caseworker.
</P>
<P>
He told of languishing in the hospital's bureaucratic system that
evaluates soldiers for continuing in active duty or becoming
medically retired, and what benefits they should receive. His
paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start
over several times.
</P>
<P>
Spc. Jeremy Duncan, one ear shredded by a makeshift bomb, told of
the moldy living conditions in Building 18.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't fit for anybody to live in a room like that," Duncan
said.
</P>
<P>
Annette L. McLeod, whose husband, Wendell, returned from Iraq
with a head injury, spoke emotionally of her distress during his
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"My life was ripped apart the day my husband was injured, and
having to live through the mess we've had to live through at
Walter Reed has been worse than anything I've had to sacrifice in
my life," Annette McLeod said through tears.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was
"extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions
at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The
Washington Post. His brother, Maj. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, a senior
medical officer, has now been named to command Walter Reed. The
Army officials said extensive repairs were being made to deal
with the deplorable conditions at one of the facilities on the
hospital campus, Building 18, in which soldiers getting
outpatient treatment at the hospital were found to be living in
crumbling rooms soiled by mice, cockroaches and mold. Most of the
soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.
</P>
<P>
Allegations about shoddy treatment received by wounded soldiers
at the prominent hospital, which is the centerpiece of the
military's medical system, have touched a public nerve and deeply
embarrassed the military in the past few weeks. The Bush
administration has been thrown on the defensive, and members of
Congress have been quick to express outrage.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely the wrong way to treat our troops, and
serious reforms need to happen immediately," said Rep. John F.
Tierney, D-Mass., who is the chairman of the House oversight and
government reform subcommittee on national security and foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of
broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the
country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence
of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq." He
warned of a coming crunch with President Bush's new plan to send
21,500 more troops to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
"As we send more and more troops into Iraq and Afghanistan, these
problems are only going to get worse, not better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey was ousted over his
handling of the revelations at Walter Reed, and officials changed
the hospital's commanding officer twice in as many days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday,
Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated the White House's pledge to
fix the problems at Walter Reed.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
"As we work to improve conditions at Walter Reed, we want to find
out whether similar problems have occurred at other military" and
Veterans Administration hospitals, he said. "These brave men and
women deserve the heartfelt thanks of our country, and they
deserve the very best medical care that our government can
possibly provide."
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical
during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news
articles have hinted at similar problems for years. Rep. Thomas
M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee,
said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans
is in need of a "top down overhaul."
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to be able to Scotch tape over it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who
also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers
and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent
simplification."
</P>
<P>
"We really need to reinvent this process," Kiley said.
</P>
<P>
Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W.
Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the
appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to
downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
</P>
<P>
He was pressed on Monday to explain how he had not known about
the conditions at Building 18, even though he lived across the
street from it. He explained that inspections of barracks were
not part of his normal job duties. But the subcommittee members
continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action
earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and
wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to
civilians had left the hospital depleted.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of
competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes,
D-N.H.
</P>
<P>
Beyond specific steps to streamline the bureaucratic process that
is faced by wounded troops and to improve living conditions,
military officials said it may be time to re-evaluate whether
Walter Reed should be closed in several years, as had been
previously planned as part of a national base reorganization
process.
</P>
<P>
Several patients at Walter Reed attended the hearing Monday and
echoed some of the problems described. But Staff Sgt. Brian Beem,
who lost his right leg to a makeshift bomb in Baghdad in October,
said he had no idea conditions were so bad for some of his
counterparts, even though he had heard grumbling.
</P>
<P>
"At my level," Beem said, "I'm ignorant of it."
