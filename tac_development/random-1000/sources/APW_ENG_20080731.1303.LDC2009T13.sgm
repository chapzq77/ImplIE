Country music star John Rich wants like-minded voters to join him
in "Raising McCain."
</P>
<P>
The other half of the Nashville duo Big and Rich, the singer-
songwriter has penned lyrics for a rock-infused anthem focused on
the 5 1/2 years Republican presidential candidate John McCain
spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his refusal of an early
release.
</P>
<P>
"He stayed strong, stayed extra long til they let all the other
boys out. Now we've got a real man with an American plan, we're
going to put him in the big White House," the song says. Its
refrain: "We're all just raising McCain" -- a play on the phrase
"raising Cain" that refers to causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
Rich, 34, planned to debut "Raising McCain" on Friday at the
Country First concert in Panama City, Florida, with McCain on
hand.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Rich said he hadn't been involved in politics
before but got excited about the Arizona senator's campaign. He
finished the song about a month ago and sent it to McCain's
daughter Meghan, who sent it onto campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to offer him something that he didn't have, a rally
song, one that really captures that maverick spirit," Rich said.
</P>
<P>
Rich said McCain's Vietnam experience motivated him to compose
the song, which he planned to offer on his Web site without
charge.
</P>
<P>
"This guy is a hero," Rich said. "He was physically tortured for
years, and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our
country for decades."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas composed a
song for Obama, "Yes We Can," and enlisted celebrities like
actress Scarlett Johansson and singer John Legend to perform and
sing. The song became an online sensation, drawing more than 8
million hits on YouTube alone.
</P>
<P>
Rich said that while he admired Obama and was "proud as an
American" that a black candidate was on the verge of winning the
Democratic nomination, he disagreed with the Illinois senator on
most major issues and felt he didn't have enough experience to be
president.
</P>
<P>
"The entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us," Rich
said. "National security is absolutely at the top of the list of
issues. That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us
safe."
