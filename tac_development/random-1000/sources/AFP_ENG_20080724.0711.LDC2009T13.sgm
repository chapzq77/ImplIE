Ball in North Korean court on nuclear progress: Rice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday the ball is
now in North Korea's court after six-party talks here with her
North Korean counterpart on verifying Pyongyang's nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the North Koreans left with any illusions about
the fact that the ball is in their court, and that everybody
believes that they have got to respond and respond positively on
verification," Rice told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rice held an informal meeting in Singapore on Wednesday with the
foreign ministers of North Korea, China, Russia, Japan and South
Korea on establishing arrangments for verification under a US
draft protocol.
</P>
<P>
Rice, who met North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui-Chun for the
first time, said the talks had focused "overwhelmingly" on a
protocol that Washington hopes will be agreed by early August.
</P>
<P>
Begun in 2003 before lapsing for three years, the six-country
disarmament negotiations resumed after North Korea staged its
first nuclear test in 2006, finally producing a landmark
denuclearisation agreement in February 2007.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations then hit a deadlock at the end of last year when
North Korea failed to meet a deadline to fully disable its
weapons-grade plutonium plants and deliver a full accounting of
its nuclear activities, including a suspected uranium enrichment
program.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock was broken last month when North Korea handed over a
partial accounting or "declaration" of its plutonium-related
programmes that must now be completely dismantled and the whole
process verified.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush has begun the procedure to remove
North Korea from a blacklist of countries that allegedly sponsor
terrorism as well as ease economic sanctions on North Korea,
though most remain in place.
</P>
<P>
Rice said that required a minimum of 45 days notification, the
same period Washington has given North Korea to agree on the
verification protocol.
</P>
<P>
"I think it should be very well understood that unless we're
satisfied that we can verify the declaration, we have been very
clear that we're taking that into our assessment of when to go
forward," Rice said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to trust the North Korean number on how much
plutonium they made," Rice said.
</P>
<P>
But she said there are "internationally recognised methods to
verify the number of kilograms of plutonium made."
</P>
<P>
The protocol will "have to have specific measures, it will have
to have means for access, and it will also have to have means to
continue this process as new information becomes available," Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a strong protocol. All the parties yesterday talked
about a rigorous protocol, talked about one that is to
international standards."
</P>
<P>
"Given the proliferation risk of plutonium in the hands of an
opaque non- transparent regime, particularly in ever larger
quantities, it is very important to shut down that capability,"
the top US diplomat added.
