The militant al-Qaida group announced Thursday the imminent
arrival of a new video message from American-born Islamist Adam
Gadahn, making it the first message from the organization in
2008.

"Coming soon by the will of God, an invitation to reflection and
repentance," read the banner produced by al-Sahab, al-Qaida's
media wing, and displayed on a militant Web site.

An image of the bearded Gadahn wearing a red and white checkered
Arab scarf appears on the banner.

The California-born Gadahn, also known as Azzam al-Amriki, was
charged with treason in the U.S. in fall 2006 and has been wanted
since 2004 by the FBI, which is offering a US$1 million (euro0.73
million) reward for information leading to his arrest or
conviction.

He last appeared on a video in August threatening new attacks on
foreign embassies.
