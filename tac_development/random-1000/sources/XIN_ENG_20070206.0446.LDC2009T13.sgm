China's top legislator Wu Bangguo met here Wednesday with
Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, calling for further
cooperation between the two countries.

China's National People's Congress (NPC) will enhance exchanges
with the Slovakian parliament to facilitate mutual understanding
between the two peoples and consolidate social basis for
bilateral friendship, said Wu.

Wu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, hailed smooth China-
Slovakia ties, saying there are no such problems affecting
bilateral cooperation.

"China and Slovakia have become friends and partners as the two
countries trust each other politically, carry out mutually
beneficial cooperation and support each other in international
affairs," said Wu.

Fico, who is on his first China visit since he assumed the office
of prime minister last July, said Slovakia will continue its one
China policy and further trade cooperation with China.

Fico held talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Monday, and the
two signed documents on cooperation in areas such as agriculture
and education.

In a separate business forum in Beijing, Fico invited more
Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Slovakia, promising to provide
favorable tax policies and a sound investment environment.
