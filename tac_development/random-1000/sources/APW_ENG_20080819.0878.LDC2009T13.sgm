Russia's Foreign Minister has criticized NATO after the alliance
warned that its cooperation with Moscow will depend on the
pullout of troops from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov says NATO is pursuing anti-Russian policies and
supporting an aggressive Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He insists Moscow is not occupying Georgia and has no plans to
annex the separatist Georgian regions of South Ossetia and
Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov spoke to journalists in Moscow Tuesday shortly after top
officials from NATO nations met in Brussels. They urged Russia to
withdraw its forces after a brief war in Georgia and promised to
bolster support for NATO hopeful Georgia.

Lavrov suggested the alliance was treating Russia like a child
that needed discipline.
