</HEADLINE>

DAKAR, May 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The time is not ripe for France to disengage itself from the
African continent, said Alain Joyandet, France's secretary of
state for Cooperation and French- Speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
Joyandet stressed that the moment is right for the country "to
consolidate its waning presence" in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time to leave Africa" because "the time when
France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa is now,"
Joyandet was quoted as telling reporters shortly after arriving
in Dakar on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Competition from Asian countries and the oil-rich emirates is a
new element that must be taken into account. There are a number
of countries that were not interested in Africa, but who are now
beginning to show keen interest," said Joyandet, who is in the
Senegalese capital for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
"In the decades ahead, the major changes that will take place in
economic terms will probably be here in Africa," said the French
official.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a time when France needs to consolidate its presence
in Africa, it is now. For it is now that we should be laying the
foundation for what will happen within the next 20 years," said
Joyandet.
</P>
<P>
"Not only is this not the time to leave... but the president (
Nicolas Sarkozy) has asked me to spend most of my time looking
into African issues. This goes to underscore the determination of
France," said he, adding that "there was no question of going
back. "
</P>
<P>
The remarks by the senior French official are coming at a time
when analysts both inside and outside Africa are wondering
whether France will pursue a policy of continuity with Africa or
"a new break" as promised by President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of
his electoral triumph.
</P>
<P>
Asked for comments, Joyandet, who replaced the outspoken Jean-
Marie Bockel who openly criticized old-style ties with Africa,
replied laconically that his aim is to lead to "the modernization
of the existing relations between France and Africa."
</P>
<P>
Addressing French nationals residing in Senegal in the presence
of the ambassadorr Jean-Christophe Rufin, Joyandet took time to
stress the benefits of the existing ties, including economic
ones, between France and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
"Over 25,000 French citizens live and work in Senegal, where one
of the largest French communities in sub-Saharan Africa is
founded," said the French diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of French subsidiaries and companies accounted for
25 percent of Senegal's gross domestic product (GDP), said he,
adding that the companies contributed nearly 28 percent of tax
revenues, besides employing 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In terms of Official Development Assistance, "Senegal is the
country that receives the largest share of France's aid in sub-
Saharan Africa," said the French official ahead of a meeting with
Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade.
