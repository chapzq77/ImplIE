Switzerland returns plundered Constable painting to Jewish family
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Swiss museum will return a 19th century painting by British
landscape artist John Constable to relatives of French Jews 65
years after it was stolen and auctioned in wartime occupied
France, a local official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Musee des Beaux-Arts in Chaux-de-Fonds in the west of
Switzerland was "reasonably convinced that this painting was
looted," town councillor Jean- Pierre Veya said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor had decided to return the painting on "moral" grounds,
even if there are no Swiss laws requiring such a restitution,
Veya told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The 1820 oil-on-canvas view of "Dedham from Langham" was
confiscated from a Jewish family in the French town of Nice on
the Mediterranean and sold at auction there in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Veya said the Chaux-de-Fonds city hall had decided to return the
work to the family of southern French art collectors John and
Anna Jaffe after a request by Anna Jaffe's great nephew, a Paris-
based teacher.
</P>
<P>
But the city authorities were seeking an agreement whereby the
new owner would be prepared to let the painting remain in the art
gallery on loan in view of the work of restoration the gallery
had done on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The museum had been exhibiting the painting for some 20 years.
</P>
<P>
A private collector donated it to the museum in the late 1980s
after buying it from a Geneva art gallery in 1946.
