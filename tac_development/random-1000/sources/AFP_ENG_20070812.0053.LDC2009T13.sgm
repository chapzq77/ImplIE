A 13-year-old Egyptian boy who had lost consciousness while in
police detention died in the Nile Delta town of Mansura on
Sunday, four days after his release, a legal source said.

<P>
The family of Mohamed Mamduh Abdel Aziz, who had been arrested
for theft, have filed a complaint against the police, claiming
they tortured their son to death, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The boy died at Mansura hospital, where he was brought four days
earlier after police released him.
</P>
<P>
The source said the boy had lost consciousness during his six
days in police detention, apparently after being violently
beaten.

On Wednesday, the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said it
has documented 567 cases of torture in police custody of which
167 resulted in death since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report was based on individual testimonies, legal cases and
medical and autopsy reports and included 26 cases of police
torture recorded this year alone, which resulted in three deaths.
</P>
<P>
According to London-based Amnesty International, torture in
detention is systematic in Egypt and, in the majority of cases,
the perpetrators are not brought to justice.
