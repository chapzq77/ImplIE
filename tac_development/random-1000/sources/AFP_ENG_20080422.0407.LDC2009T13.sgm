China reacted angrily Tuesday to a meeting between a senior US
official and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama,
urging Washington to "stop indulging" the Nobel Peace Prize
winner.The Dalai Lama on Monday met US special envoy on Tibet
Paula Dobriansky in the US state of Michigan, where he told her
his homeland needed the help of the United States.

<P>
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China had complained
directly to the United States about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This official ... deliberately ignored China's resolute
opposition and persisted in meeting with the Dalai (Lama)," Jiang
told reporters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the US side to respect facts and stop indulging the
Dalai clique in its separatist activities so as not to harm our
bilateral relations and the image of the US itself," she added.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday talks, the Dalai Lama asked Washington for help
in improving the situation in Tibet, in the highest-level meeting
with the US administration since Beijing began a crackdown on
unrest in the Himalayan region.

<P>
Protests against Chinese rule rocked Tibet last month. Exiled
Tibetan leaders saying more than 150 people died in a subsequent
government crackdown, though Beijing says Tibetan "rioters"
killed 18 civilians and two policemen.

<P>
China's clampdown has triggered international outrage, with major
protests disrupting the Beijing Olympic torch relay in London and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
It was Dobriansky's 12th meeting with the Dalai Lama aimed at
finding a way to resolve the Tibet issue amicably, the US State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment we need your help," the Dalai Lama told
Dobriansky, adding that the Tibet issue was "very significant."
</P>
<P>
Dobriansky, undersecretary of state for democracy and global
affairs, reiterated a US appeal for dialogue between Beijing and
the Dalai Lama, saying the Bush administration "has expressed
concern and has urged restraint" in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
China has insisted the unrest in Tibet is an attempt by the Dalai
Lama to sabotage the August Beijing Olympics, and Jiang
criticised the United States for failing to condemn him for his
alleged role in the troubles.
</P>
<P>
She said the meeting was "a serious violation of the basic norms
of international relations and interference in our internal
affairs."
