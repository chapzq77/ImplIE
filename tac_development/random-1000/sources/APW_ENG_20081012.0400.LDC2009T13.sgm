After three years in the test wilderness, cricket allrounder
Shane Watson was having the time of his life Sunday on his return
to the Australia side for the first of four tests against India.
</P>
<P>
Watson's most important contribution in the match so far came
when he and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (28 not out) helped lift
Australia from a perilous 128 for 5 in the second innings with a
65-run unbeaten partnership.
</P>
<P>
At stumps Australia was 193-5 wickets and had a lead of 263.
</P>
<P>
Watson compiled a nerveless 32 not out from 67 balls and was
ecstatic with his input over the first four days.
</P>
<P>
"This test has been the most fun I've ever had playing cricket,"
he said. "It's been an amazing learning experience. Just batting
out there is the most I've ever learnt in an innings."
</P>
<P>
Watson overcame the duel dangers of offspinner Harbhajan Singh,
who was responsible for the early damage with 2-76, and the
searing reverse swing of Zaheer Khan.
</P>
<P>
"It's been an amazing three or four days so far," he said. "I'm
having more fun than I ever thought I'd have playing cricket. I'm
just making the most of it and enjoying every second."
</P>
<P>
Watson, 27, was called into the touring squad last month after
Andrew Symonds was stood down for disciplinary reasons. It was
the end of a long road back from a run of injuries that started
when he dislocated a shoulder while fielding in a test against
the West Indies in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has had regular problems with a troublesome
hamstring but fought his way into the test team through
consistent performances in the Indian Premier League and the one-
day international side.
</P>
<P>
Watson also chipped in with three wickets as Australia dismissed
India for 360 and gained a 70-run first innings lead.
</P>
<P>
He removed Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Saturday before trapping
Anil Kumble lbw in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
"Wickets to me don't matter," he said. "My role is to bowl as
tightly as I can and build pressure, to make it extremely hard. I
enjoy every wicket I get -- but they're a massive bonus."
</P>
<P>
Watson will get more bowling on the final day once Australia
decide when to declare its innings and push for victory. Paceman
Stuart Clark has a sore elbow that is preventing him from
throwing overarm but he is expected to bowl on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Watson said he had not talked to Ricky Ponting about his plans
for the final day, but had faith in Australia's bowlers to seal a
1-0 advantage in the first of four tests.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is going to reverse swing fairly quickly, which is very
handy for our quicks," Watson said. "The wicket is deteriorating
a little, but definitely not as much as I thought it would. We
are going to have to bowl extremely well to bowl the Indians
out."
