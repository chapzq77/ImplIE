Australia and Russia sign uranium trade deal

<P>
The leaders of Russia and Australia signed a deal Friday to
export Australian uranium to fuel Russian nuclear power plants,
and promised the atomic material would not be sold on to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian Prime Minister
John Howard signed the deal during bilateral talks on the
sidelines of a summit of Pacific Rim leaders in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
While the agreement forbids Russia from selling Australian
uranium to any other nation or using it for military purposes,
critics of the deal worry that it could make it easier for rogue
states to obtain the raw material.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Russia could be trusted not to sell Australian
uranium to Tehran, Putin said his mineral-rich country already
had an "excessive" supply of military-grade uranium that it was
reprocessing and selling to U.S. power plants.
</P>
<P>
"If we have a need to sell uranium to other countries, our
resources, our own resources, are sufficient," Putin told
reporters through a translator.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia planned to build an extra 30 nuclear power plants
over the next two decades and needed Australian uranium to
complete the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Australia has the world's largest reserves of the atomic
resource, but has no nuclear power program of its own. Exporting
uranium for nuclear power remains a touchy issue among many
Australians, who are uneasy about its environmental impact and
potential for weapons use.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the inflow of Australian uranium would allow Russia
to divert its own supply of the atomic resource to military or
export purposes.
</P>
<P>
"It may very well be the case that what Russia will do will be to
use Australian uranium for domestic purposes," Graeme Gill, a
Russia expert at the Sydney University told the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio. But "what that does is free up Russian
sources of uranium, which they can then ship abroad."
</P>
<P>
Howard has rejected criticism of the Russian uranium deal, saying
it is a logical progression from Australia's recent agreement to
export atomic fuel to China to feed that country's growing energy
needs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also dismissed concerns about Australian
atomic fuel falling into Iran's hands, saying that any uranium
sold under the deal would be "subject to very strict safeguards."
</P>
<P>
Russia has built Iran's first nuclear power plant and has a
significant financial stake in Iran's nuclear power program.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, Moscow has played a complicated role
in attempts to pressure Tehran to comply with global demands that
it suspend its budding nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China have blocked attempts by the U.S., Britain and
France -- the three other permanent Security Council members --
to impose harsh U.N. sanctions and have hobbled efforts to move
forward on new penalties this summer in the face of continued
Iranian refusal to freeze its enrichment activities.
