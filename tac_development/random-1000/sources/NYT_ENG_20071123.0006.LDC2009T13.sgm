CHINA RAISES TOLL TO 31 IN LANDSLIDE IN THREE GORGES DAM AREA

Chinese authorities on Friday confirmed the deaths of about 30
more people from a landslide that struck this week in the Three
Gorges Dam region. The news comes as Chinese officials are facing
growing questions about environmental and geological problems
related to the dam project.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from state news media on Wednesday stated that
one construction worker died, another was injured and two more
were trapped in a landslide on Tuesday at a railroad construction
site in Badong County, upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
But on Friday morning, Xinhua, the official news agency, released
a short report saying that rescuers had discovered a passenger
bus crushed beneath the rubble. It said "about 30 more people"
were believed dead.
</P>
<P>
"Rescuers said there were no signs of life on the bus," Xinhua
reported. The bus apparently left Shanghai on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no news about the two trapped workers.
</P>
<P>
As yet, it is not certain what caused this particular landslide,
but scientists and critics have been warning for years that the
reservoir created by the Three Gorges Dam might further
destabilize hillsides, causing landslides and possibly even
earthquakes. Officials countered that the design of the project
accounted for such concerns.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Chinese officials have been trying to tamp down
growing controversy about the impact that the dam is having on
the environment and fragile geology in the surrounding region.
</P>
<P>
At a September forum about the dam, Chinese officials and experts
discussed issues like water pollution, sedimentation and
landslides and warned of a future environmental "catastrophe" if
measures were not taken. At the meeting, a vice mayor from the
city of Chongqing said the shoreline of the reservoir had
collapsed in 91 places as water levels continued to slowly rise.
</P>
<P>
A day after the forum, Xinhua released a short article disclosing
the official concerns. The article caused an immediate sensation,
given that officials had rarely expressed misgivings about the
signature project. This week, Chinese officials have been making
a major public relations push to play down problems at the dam.
China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, ran a
banner article across the front page beneath the headline: "Dam
Impact 'Less Than Predicted.' "
</P>
<P>
Landslides had been a problem in the Three Gorges area before
construction of the dam. Dam officials say they have made
improvements in stabilizing the region's geology in recent years
and that landslides are not a major problem. But peasants in many
villages say the number of landslides have increased since the
reservoir began filling up. Several local officials have said
that pressure from the rising water is a factor in many, if not
all, the recent landslides. Currently, water levels are at about
500 feet. Planners intend to raise water levels to 575 feet by
2009.
