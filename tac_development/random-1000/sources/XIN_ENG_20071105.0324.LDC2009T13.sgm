Convention

THE HAGUE, Nov. 5 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Developed and developing countries on Monday voiced different
opinions over the way forward for the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) after 10 years of its entry into force.
</P>
<P>
At an annual conference of the CWC member states, developed
countries called for rapid national implementation of the
convention, while developing countries asked for access to
technology and international cooperation in chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamental to ensure the removal of and to prevent the
imposition of any discriminatory restriction on access to
materials, equipment and technology required by developing states
parties for their continued and peaceful development," said a
joint statement of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and China.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the NAM CWC states parties and China reiterate
their call to developed countries to promote international
cooperation through the transfer of technology, material and
equipment for peaceful purposes in the chemical field and to
remove all and any discriminatory restrictions," said the
statement read by Oscar De Los Reyes Ramos, Cuba's permanent
representative to the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
</P>
<P>
A European Union statement complained, however, about the slow
pace of the implementation of Article VII of the CWC, which
covers national implementation, including legislative and
administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
"Full compliance with Article VII is a vital factor for the
present and future efficiency of the CWC regime," said the
statement read by Portuguese representative to the OPCW, Julio
Mascarenhas.
</P>
<P>
Washington also expressed concern over the fact that a small
number of countries have not taken "meaningful steps" to meet
their obligations under Article VII.
</P>
<P>
"Article VII requires all states to implement the convention
fully, which typically requires an array of laws, regulations and
procedures," said U.S. permanent representative to the OPCW, Eric
Javits, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are under way for decisions on Article VII and
Article XI at this year's conference, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Developed and developing countries agreed on universality of the
CWC membership. They all urged those countries that have not
joined the convention to do so without delay.
</P>
<P>
So far 182 countries have become member states of the CWC,
leaving only 13 outside.
</P>
<P>
The CWC is an international disarmament treaty which bans the
development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The OPCW, with its headquarters in The Hague, is mandated to
oversee the implementation of the chemical weapons treaty.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, a third of the world's declared stockpile
of approximately 71,000 metric tons of chemical agent has been
verifiably destroyed. Albania became the first country in the
world which has completed destruction of chemical weapons
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
The annual conference is the decision-making body of the OPCW.
Last year's conference decided to postpone the deadline for the
destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles until April 2012.
