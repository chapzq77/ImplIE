CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still
three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were
here to promote "The Counterfeiters." Ruzowitzky wrote and
directed and Markovics stars in the based-on-fact drama about a
massive Nazi-run counterfeiting operation during World War II
that used concentration camp prisoners..
</P>
<P>
But their excitement was already evident about the possibility of
winning this year's best foreign language picture Oscar - which,
in fact, "The Counterfeiters" did. Markovics and Ruzowitzky spoke
of the award with mounting animation - though not enough to mar
their fluent, moderately accented, English.
</P>
<P>
"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when
asked if the award had much meaning a continent away. "Growing up
in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an
event."
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are
back home," Ruzowitzky said. "For the Austrian public, a film
festival doesn't mean anything - whereas 'Academy Award' is just
immense. So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
</P>
<P>
Heroism, or its absence, is a central concern in "The
Counterfeiters." Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's
best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him. He's a crook, a
survivor - but also a master of his trade and a man who does his
best to protect his fellow workers. But by doing so, he's helping
the Nazi war effort. (The idea behind the counterfeiting scheme
was to destroy the British and US economies with a flood of phony
pounds and dollars.) Is Sally a hero? A villain? Neither?
</P>
<P>
"No, he's not a hero," Markovics said. "I don't believe in heroes
- and he doesn't either. There are no heroes under these
conditions. There's only surviving to the next day and being able
to face yourself in the mirror."
</P>
<P>
Heroism isn't the point, Ruzowitzky said of Sally. "He himself
believes he has no ideals or principles. Then we find out he does
have ideals. They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good
citizen. But he definitely has them."
</P>
<P>
Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as
heroism. The printers take pride in their work because they are,
in their way, artists, too. A counterfeiter is not unlike an
actor or filmmaker. Each earns his income creating a version of
reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a
character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
</P>
<P>
That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the
reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of
Sally. "When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
</P>
<P>
In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he
appears in "The Counterfeiters." Bearded and amiable, he could be
a professor playing hooky from MIT, a few blocks away from the
Hotel Marlowe, where the interview took place. "Of course I look
different," he said with a smile. "I was supposed to be in a
concentration camp." The difference is more than just a matter of
having put on a few pounds. Markovics brings a sense of brooding
inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded
eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
</P>
<P>
"I always have fun playing characters not really hiding but
giving the impression there's much more under the surface,"
Markovics said. "This always attracts me more than showing
everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing. This
character especially gave me a chance to do this."
</P>
<P>
The source of the movie is a memoir by Adolf Burger. Burger,
who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his
radical political views. He tried to sabotage the forgeries,
risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
Burger is played in the movie by August Diehl.
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to
show that everybody's right, in a way. In a camp, you can't do
the right thing or the wrong thing. All these different
perspectives are understandable.
</P>
<P>
"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would
love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and
is the one who stands up against the Nazis. So actually we shot
some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I
found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow. Why? Because in
real life we can identify with his approach, which is, yeah, I'm
just trying to get along, not change the world, be a human."
</P>
<P>
World War II seems very much a thing of the past to his
generation, said Ruzowitzky, who's 46. "It's the Holocaust,
rather than the war, that I think about. That's a real
difference. For Americans the war is Omaha Beach, Iwo Jima,
battles, soldiers. For us, I don't know any battles. Talking
about the Second World War is talking about the Nazis, talking
about the Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His
grandparents were Nazis. The one hard and fast rule he had while
filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's
point of view.
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story
though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained. "So our master
shot, which is usually in old-school filmmaking a wide shot from
an objective point of view, was always following Sally - over his
shoulder. We never, ever did a shot over-shoulder of one of the
Nazis. Burger says in the movie, 'I'd never be in the place of an
SS criminal.' My ((director of photography)) and I felt this
should be true for us as well."
</P>
<P>
"The Counterfeiters" makes clear the Nazis' evil, but that
doesn't mean it fails to acknowledge the various moral
complexities arising from the title characters' situation. There
are ways in which the World War II film it most resembles isn't
one about the Holocaust but "The Bridge on the River Kwai." In
that picture, British POWs working on a railroad bridge for the
Japanese become emotionally attached to the project - as the
counterfeiters do to theirs.
</P>
<P>
"That aspect is there," Ruzowitzky agreed. "If you meet Mr.
Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone:
whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
But as soon as he starts discussing these works of art they were
producing there, and how well they worked, and even the Bank of
England thought they were right, his eyes light up! He's so
proud, because he's a printer, and this was quite an achievement
for them."
</P>
<P>
The response to "The Counterfeiters" (it's been sold to more than
60 countries) speaks to a greater interest in German-language
films generally, Ruzowitzky said. "The success of movies like
'Lives of Others' and 'Downfall' ((the 2004 release in which
Bruno Ganz played Hitler)) has helped us a lot. People are aware
that there are new German movies which succeed in combining
difficult issues and present them in an accessible way.
Entertaining may be the wrong word for a concentration camp
movie, but it is accessible. You're not tortured if you go watch
this movie. I think German-language movies are quite successful
these days."
</P>
<P>
The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign-
language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for
"The Counterfeiters." It's not just the films themselves that
have won, though. "The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics
recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?' It's her
Oscar as well."
