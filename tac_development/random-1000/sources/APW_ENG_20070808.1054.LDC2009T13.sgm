Police boosted security on trains in northeast France on
Wednesday after receiving a tip about a suspected terrorist
threat to the rail line between Basel, Switzerland and
Luxembourg, police and prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
The DST counterintelligence service opened an investigation into
the suspected threat after Luxembourg tipped off France's
Interior Ministry overnight, the Paris prosecutor's office said.

A member of France's Synergie Officier police union said police
and train agents had been handed a flyer with information on the
physical characteristics of five Iranians suspected in connection
with the threat.
</P>
<P>
The press office at Swiss Railways, as well as cantonal police in
Basel, said they knew nothing about a suspected plot. Police
officials in Luxembourg did not immediately answer phone calls
late Wednesday.

<P>
The Paris prosecutor's office said investigators "were in an
initial phase of verifying the information that was passed
along." Police have made no arrests, the prosecutor's office
said.
