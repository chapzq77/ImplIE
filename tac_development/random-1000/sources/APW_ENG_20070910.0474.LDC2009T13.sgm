Royal Philips Electronics NV, one of Europe's largest electronics
makers, said Monday it expects to more than double profitability
by 2010 as it reorganizes the company into three main divisions.

The maker of medical and lighting equipment said in a statement
it expects to raise profitability by 7.5 percent and rearrange
its units.

"Philips plans to simplify its business structure by creating
three core sectors with strong single-headed management: Philips
Healthcare, Philips Lighting, and Philips Consumer Lifestyle,"
the company said.

Philips, which makes consumer electronics, high-end medical
equipment, energy-saving light bulbs and household appliances
like shavers, sold its semiconductor division last year. The
company has been steadily departing markets where it doesn't hold
a first or second-place position, notably divesting its mobile
phones operations after being eclipsed by Nokia Corp.

The company also said it aims to deliver a minimum of 6 percent
comparable annual average sales growth for the two-year period
through 2010.

Philips shares gained 2.7 percent to euro29.13 (US$40.12) in
Amsterdam.
