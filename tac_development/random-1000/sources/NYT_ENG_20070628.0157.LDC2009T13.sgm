FED, STILL WARY ON INFLATION, LEAVES A KEY RATE UNCHANGED
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its
"predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would
keep it at that level for some time.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets
had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's
"pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of
sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation
had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its
previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."
</P>
<P>
But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory. "A
sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be
convincingly demonstrated," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest question was how policymakers would change the
nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how
they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, Fed governors including Ben S.
Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the "core" rate
of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to
2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the
Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer
expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with
one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few
months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster
than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with
one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Fed policymakers are in no rush to reduce interest rates.
Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the
first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to
an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past
several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected
and is at levels that many economists equate with full
employment.
</P>
<P>
"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation
readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the
same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with
raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman
Brothers.
