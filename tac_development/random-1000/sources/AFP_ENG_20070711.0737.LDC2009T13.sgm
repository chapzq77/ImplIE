SKorea raises key interest rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea on Thursday raised its key interest rate for the
first time in almost a year in an apparent attempt to curb high
liquidity growth.
</P>
<P>
At its monthly rate-setting session, the Bank of Korea increased
the July target for the call rate by 0.25 percentage point to a
six-year high of 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The call rate, the interest on overnight interbank loans, had
been left at 4.5 percent since September 2006 in an attempt to
spur economic growth amid subdued inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had increasingly expected an increase amid repeated
official warnings of rapidly growing liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Money supply growth rebounded in May. The outstanding liquidity
aggregate expanded 1.3 percent month-on-month to 1,913.5 trillion
won (2.08 trillion dollars) as of the end of May after rising 0.7
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Lenders continued extending loans to smaller companies to offset
decreasing mortgage business. In the first half of this year, new
loans to smaller companies rose 1.7 times from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Apparently confident that a rate rise will not curb the economic
recovery, the central bank this week raised its 2007 growth
estimate by 0.1 percentage point to 4.5 percent. It said economic
expansion would speed up next year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government similarly increased its growth
forecast to 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output grew a higher-than-expected 6.6 percent in May
while exports in June grew 15.9 percent year-on-year to a record
32.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was 2.5 percent in June due to global oil price rises,
accelerating from 2.3 percent in May. The June figure, however,
stayed within the central bank's target band of 2.5 percent to
3.5 percent for 2007-09.
