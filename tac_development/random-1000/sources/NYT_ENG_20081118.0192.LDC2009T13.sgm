WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, convicted last month on federal
ethics charges, on Tuesday appeared to have lost his bid for a
seventh term as final ballots were counted, giving Democrats at
least 58 seats in the Senate for the first years of the Obama
administration.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 2,500 votes still outstanding and other
election certification steps still to take place, Mark Begich,
the Democratic mayor of Anchorage, had taken a lead by 3,724
votes out of more than 315,000 cast, and he declared victory.
</P>
<P>
"I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States
Senate," Begich said. "It's been an incredible journey getting to
this point, and I appreciate the support and commitment of the
thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day. I can't
wait to get to work fighting for Alaskan families."
</P>
<P>
Stevens did not immediately concede the race. He could request a
recount, but he would have to pay for it if the current vote
margins hold.
</P>
<P>
Begich's victory will end the career of the longest-serving
Republican senator ever and a pivotal figure in the history of
his state after it initially appeared he would triumph despite
his criminal conviction just days before the election.
</P>
<P>
The defeat came on Stevens' 85th birthday at the end of a day
that saw him avoid expulsion from the Senate Republican Caucus as
his colleagues said they would await the final results.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't wish what I going through on anyone, my worst enemy,"
Stevens said Tuesday morning in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Stevens' defeat will strengthen a majority that Democrats sought
to keep as large as possible by allowing Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, I-Conn., to retain his high-profile committee
chairmanship Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Democrats dropped Lieberman from another panel,
delivering a mild rebuke for his strong support of Sen. John
McCain and other Republicans in this month's elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision was part of the post-election congressional tableaux
as Senate Democrats and Republicans re-elected their current
leadership teams for the first two years of the Obama
administration. House Democrats met to make Rep. Nancy Pelsoi of
California their candidate for speaker and essentially kept their
leadership intact as well, with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland
remaining majority leader.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the legislative battles ahead, Senate Democrats said
they wanted to adhere to President-elect Barack Obama's call for
reconciliation and leniency for Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
But a pragmatic dynamic was at work as well. Having added seven
new senators to their side, Democrats want to avoid driving
Lieberman to the Republican fold. Even though they fell short of
the 60 needed to cut off filibusters, the Democrats are aiming to
keep their majority as large as possible next year when, for the
first time since 1994, they have control of Congress and the
White House. Two other Senate seats, in Minnesota and Georgia,
have yet to be decided as well.
</P>
<P>
"We have got some big issues here, and we need all hands on
deck," said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who had pushed to
keep the retribution against his home-state colleague to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Democrats voted 42-13 to let Lieberman stay at the helm of the
Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs while
removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee,
where he led a subcommittee. The formal resolution before the
Democrats, considered in what was described as an emotional
meeting in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol, also declared
that the Democratic caucus "rejects and disapproves of Senator
Lieberman's statements against Senator Obama in the 2008
presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who attended the session said that Lieberman openly
discussed the political and personal hurt he experienced when
many of his colleagues campaigned against him after he lost a
Democratic Senate primary in 2006 before winning re-election as
an independent. After the vote, he expressed some remorse for his
campaign comments but noted the resolution did not chastise him
directly for backing McCain, who returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday
to resume life as a senator.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, who only eight years ago was the party's nominee for
vice president, said there were statements he could have made
"more clearly. And there are some that I made that I wish I had
not made at all. And obviously in the heat of campaigns, that
happens to all of us. But I regret that. And now it's time to
move on."
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats remained angry that Lieberman had been so
outspoken not only in his backing for McCain, but also for his
campaigning for Republicans such as Sen. Norm Coleman, who
continued to hold a narrow lead in his re-election bid in
Minnesota. They said that stripping the chairmanship was only
fitting.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Ver., who aligns with Democrats, said
allowing Lieberman to run the committee was a "slap in the face"
to Americans who "worked day and night to get Barack Obama
elected and to move our country in a very new direction."
</P>
<P>
"Having said that, there is an enormous amount of work that is
facing the Senate, and we all have to move on and work together
to address these issues," Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of the senators to move forcefully against their
colleagues illustrates again how cautious senators are when it
comes to punishing their own. After being thwarted repeatedly by
Republican resistance in the past two years, Senate Democrats
were unwilling to lose the support of Lieberman on most domestic
policy issues, particularly after Obama had urged that Lieberman
be allowed to remain in the Democratic fold.
</P>
<P>
The resolution noted that Lieberman's vote gave Democrats the
majority in 2007 and that he voted almost 100 percent of the time
with the party on key procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
"I would defy anyone to be more angry than I was," said Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, who will remain majority leader, about
Lieberman's criticism of Obama. "But I also believe that if you
look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk
about of here saying, 'Boy, did we get even'? I am very satisfied
with what we did today."
</P>
<P>
The decision touched off attacks on the Democrats by liberal and
progressive groups and on the Internet, where critics accused
Democrats of weakness in their posture against Lieberman, who
they have branded a traitor to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
But senators pointed to statements by the Obama campaign in
support of Lieberman as justification for their decision. "The
Senate Democratic Caucus has decided that if President-elect
Barack Obama can forgive, so can we," said Sen. Tom Carper,
D-Del.
</P>
<P>
Despite a second round of Republican losses, Sen. Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky was returned as Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans also easily disposed of a call by Sen. Jim
DeMint of South Carolina to impose term limits on the Republican
leader and members of the Appropriations Committee,
overwhelmingly rejecting the proposals.
</P>
<P>
In the House, Democrats gathered for the leadership elections and
bid farewell to Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., who is relinquishing
his No. 4 post in the party hierarchy to become chief of staff to
Obama.
</P>
<P>
Those in the closed meeting said Emanuel became emotional and
told his colleagues it was "not an easy decision for me" to give
up his House seat.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know, I've got your back," Emanuel said, according
to one account. "I'll feel better knowing that you've got my
back."
