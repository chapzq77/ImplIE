Children's Cold Remedies Raised Questions for Years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a
drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a
pediatrician and father of two young boys. "Kids with colds were
getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either
effective or safe."
</P>
<P>
So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he
launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug
Administration to conclude last week that the products should not
be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and
setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the
pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the
products.
</P>
<P>
The case has also raised many questions: How could the products
remain on the market for so long without proof they work? Why
didn't the FDA act sooner? Why didn't the medical establishment
warn parents? Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
</P>
<P>
Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of
questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific
product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold
medication that were a cause for obvious concern. But several
experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had
never been studied in children.
</P>
<P>
"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to
children that have never been tested in children," Michael
Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be
inappropriate for children."
</P>
<P>
"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, a consumer group. "You're just left
scratching your head about how this could go on for so long."
</P>
<P>
The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the
evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults
and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the
market before government requirements for stringent testing, and
it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in
children.
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many
products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had
authority to regulate them closely. Once the FDA got that power
in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes
of products.
</P>
<P>
"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and
hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA
deputy commissioner. "They gave priority to prescription drugs,
for understandable reasons. The over-the-counter drug review was
never made a priority in the agency, and so it dragged on for
years and years."
</P>
<P>
The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to
review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded
there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in
products. But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that
doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, it was felt that was the best level of
evidence we could have," said Marsha Rappley, a professor of
pediatrics at Michigan State University who co-chaired last
week's panel. "We now understand that we can organize studies in
children and don't have to extrapolate from adults. But that
wasn't the case back then."
</P>
<P>
Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines
periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of
monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were
made for children and the products never again received any kind
of detailed scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in
children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions. The
Journal of the American Medical Association published an analysis
in 1993 that concluded there was no good evidence the medications
worked. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international
project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a
similar conclusion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and
began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors
continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products
remained a mainstay.
</P>
<P>
"Where do parents get a lot of their information? If you are a
desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and
your kid has a cold what do you do? You go to the drugstore and
see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and
assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of
pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co-
signed Sharfstein's petition.
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Pediatrics adopted a policy in 1997
stating cough products were ineffective, and the American College
of Chest Physicians produced a similar statement in 2006. But
other groups, such as the American College of Family Physicians,
never issued any formal guidance to doctors, and no major medical
groups ever officially questioned the class of products or
campaigned against their use.
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a vacuum in leadership on this issue by the
professional societies," Lurie said. "You can justify the
argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a
much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any
of these studies."
</P>
<P>
Some experts defend the medical groups, saying policy statements
from doctor groups can only do so much, especially against the
aggressive marketing by large pharmaceutical companies, which
spend more than $50 million a year to sell the products.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 25 or 30 years we've been warning about violence on
TV," said Snodgrass, who also chairs the American Academy of
Pediatrics committee on drugs. "What has that done? In this case
we're up against multibillion-dollar industry. The American
Academy of Pediatrics is not a multibillion-dollar industry. We
try to do what we can, but there's only so much we can do. Where
are the companies in this? Where was the FDA in this?"
</P>
<P>
But Sharfstein and others wonder whether the medical profession
could have been more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
"When I was trained as a pediatrician it was just accepted that
these products had no role. This was known in the profession,"
Sharfstein said. "It's a fair question why there wasn't a strong
regulatory challenge by the profession. They could have justified
one. But what really stunned us was that this was never really
looked at from the legal-regulatory side."
</P>
<P>
Using powers it received from two new laws, the FDA has begun
demanding some prescription drugs be tested in children before
being approved, and it has enticed drug companies to conduct
pediatric studies of those already on the market.
</P>
<P>
Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's
petition because they had become alarmed by the studies
questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports
of possible dangers. The federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than
1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse
reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
</P>
<P>
The FDA is now reviewing last week's recommendations, but because
of the history of the products it says any formal action could
take years. In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any
adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to
parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers
to organize studies of the products. The industry has voluntarily
withdrawn products designed for children younger than 2, but it
maintains that the remedies are both safe and effective for older
children when used properly, blaming the problems primarily on
overdoses.
</P>
<P>
"If the industry decides to dig in its heels against the clear
guidance of the advisory committee I hope the FDA has the ability
to stop them," Sharfstein said. "It's a very small risk,
unquestionably. But if you don't have evidence that the products
work and you have kids who have died from taking them, I don't
think there's a role for them."
