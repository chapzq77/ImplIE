Tsunami alerts quickly followed Indonesian quake; panic prevailed
elsewhere

BANGKOK, Thailand 2007-09-14 04:00:19 UTC

<P>
By most accounts, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation
System passed its first big test, with the massive earthquakes in
Indonesia providing the perfect opportunity for drills from Asia
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the temblors off Indonesia's western coast on
Wednesday -- and yet another on Thursday -- officials sent out
warnings by mobile phone SMS, e-mail and fax to coastal
communities in the path of potential monster waves.
</P>
<P>
Similar warnings reached governments as far away as Bangladesh
and Kenya, where coastal residents and tourists were ushered off
beaches with megaphones and onto higher ground.
</P>
<P>
"They were quite fast in delivering the warning. The first
warning went out in five or six minutes," said Michael Rottmann,
the U.N. special coordinator for the early warning system in
Indonesia. "The president announced the system will be ready in
2008, but this earthquake showed it's working already."
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged there were glitches, with evacuations in
Indonesia marked by fear and panic in some hard-hit
neighborhoods. Residents on Thailand's six southern provinces
rushed to the hills and remained there for two hours -- even
though a tsunami alert had yet to be issued.
</P>
<P>
The 2004 tsunami hit southern Thailand, including the tourist
resort of Phuket, and killed more than 8,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"People in the southern provinces heard warnings from other
centers abroad and were panicking," Smith Dharmasaroja, director
of the National Disaster Warning Center, told Thai TV viewers
when he broke into regular programming to make an emergency
address.
</P>
<P>
For some experts, however, the performance highlighted progress
many governments in the region have made since the 2004 Indian
Ocean disaster which left 230,000 dead. That disaster was marked
by failure to warn many communities about the impending waves,
mostly due to faulty equipment, poor communications and
cumbersome bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
It prompted the United Nations and six government donors,
including the United States, to create a US$130 million (euro97
million) tsunami warning system, which is expected to be fully
operational at the end next year.
</P>
<P>
Progress was initially slowed by bickering over technical
problems with deep-sea monitoring buoys. Governments also came
under fire for failing to educate citizens about the threat of
tsunamis, bolster coastal infrastructure, and establishing ways
to pass along warnings to remote villages.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, Indonesia, which was hit hardest by the 2004
disaster, has installed dozens of tidal gauges and deep-ocean
tsunami monitoring buoys to detect waves as well as more than 150
seismometers to detect earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
It has vastly improved its communication network, resulting in a
quake alert going out within minutes of the actual temblor. The
quake was detected on a seismograph which relays a message to the
country's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency. It then sent a
warning to hundreds of emergency management personnel in the
disaster-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
Tsunami alerts managed to reach remote areas including coastal
communities in Australia's northwestern territories of Christmas
and Cocos Islands, India's Andaman Islands, as well as beachfront
communities in Sri Lanka severely damaged by the 2004 tsunami.
</P>
<P>
G.G. Somaratne from Payagala, a southern coastal town in Sri
Lanka, said that all his neighbors were panic-stricken when the
tsunami warning came.
</P>
<P>
"We took all our valuable goods to the second floor of a
neighbor, carried whatever we could take and went to a relative's
home some seven miles away," said Somaratne, who is still
rebuilding his beachside home destroyed in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"People were in temples and churches, relatives and friends, and
returned after the warning was lifted, but some are still scared
to come back," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, volunteers with bullhorns warned villagers to
evacuate to higher or inland areas, while local television and
radio stations issued warnings as town halls opened control rooms
to monitor the situation. In the southern sea resort town of
Cox's Bazar, tourists were evacuated to inland hotels while the
country's national soccer team -- holding a training camp -- was
rushed off to a hilltop guest house.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian communities were praised for responding to alerts by
rushing to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that there has been a lot of public awareness in
Padang and Bengkulu," said Richard Whelden, deputy mission
director for the U.S. Agency for International Development in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
"People didn't run to the water," after the quakes, he said.
"They got out of their houses and moved away from the water. The
point is that people responded, which is something that wouldn't
have happened two years ago."
