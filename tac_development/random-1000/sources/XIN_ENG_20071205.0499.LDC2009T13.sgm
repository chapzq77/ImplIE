Former Northeast Expressway chief gets death sentence in
corruption case
</HEADLINE>

BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The former board chairman of the Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.
was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being
convicted on five counts of corruption, including bribery.
</P>
<P>
Under a final ruling handed down on Tuesday by the Intermediate
People's Court of Baicheng City, Jilin Province, Zhang Xiaoguang
was found guilty of taking bribes, corruption, embezzlement of
public funds, illegally seeking private interest on behalf of
relatives, and possessing major assets for which he could not
account, the Beijing News reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his convictions, Zhang was also stripped of
political rights for life and all his personal property was
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The five counts involved 50 million yuan, but there was no
breakdown for each count.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Zhang's case is believed to be
connected with another incident in which Gao Shan, former head of
a branch of the Bank of China (BOC) on Hesong Street in Harbin,
the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, allegedly
siphoned 1 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars) from
customers' accounts to Canada.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite
Gao, who fled after sending the funds to Canada in 2005, and
another suspect, Li Dongzhe. They are currently under the
surveillance of Canadian police.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's case was a complex one, the newspaper reported, as shown
by the 36-page court verdict that ran to nearly 30,000 Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of
misappropriating public funds.
</P>
<P>
Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd, a publicly listed company, said two
days later in a public announcement that 293 million yuan of its
funds were missing from the BOC's Hesong Street Branch. Shortly
afterwards, Gao, chief of the branch, was discovered to have fled
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's first trial commenced at the Intermediate People's Court
of Baicheng City in September 2006. However, it was soon called
off at the request of public prosecutors for further
investigation, following the detention of Dong Fang, former
general manager of Donggao Science and Technologies Oils Co. Ltd,
a subsidiary of Northeast Expressway, who reportedly gave Zhang
10 million yuan in bribes.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang
deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch
after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind
behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of
Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pleaded innocent in the BOC case in a second trial held in
January this year.
