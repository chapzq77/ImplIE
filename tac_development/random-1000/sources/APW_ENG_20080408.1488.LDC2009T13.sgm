WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal audit of 18 beef slaughterhouses
following the U.S.'s largest beef recall found humane handling
violations in four of them, including one serious enough for the
plant to be temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently
stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the
first attempt. That plant has taken corrective actions and its
suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward
Schafer. None of the plants was identified.
</P>
<P>
The audit, which covered slaughterhouses that supply beef to the
National School Lunch Program and other federal food assistance
programs, was requested by Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat
who chairs the Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee.
Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on
the beef recall Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the department recalled 143 million pounds of
meat from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. in Chino, California,
following an undercover video by the Humane Society of the United
States that showed slaughterhouse workers abusing "downer" cattle
-- those too sick or injured to stand.
</P>
<P>
The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but
it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use
of electronic stunning prods; overcrowding of animals in the
pens; and bunching up of cattle going into the stunning area.
Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for
insufficient stunning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a
high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter. While not a
violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to
avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
</P>
<P>
The problems uncovered by the audit have been corrected, Schafer
told Kohl at Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added. "We
have helped train our inspectors to observe while being
unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
</P>
<P>
Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic
humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant
other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to
warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not
in compliance with humane handling practices. I am working with
USDA to gather more information about these audits and to find
ways to ensure that the problems being discovered do not
continue."
</P>
<P>
Schafer told reporters after the hearing that based on the
audit's findings, he does not believe the problems at
Westland/Hallmark were systemic.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be confined, on a downer cow issue, to the Chino
facility," he said. "But our continuing investigation will give
us the full answer to that."
</P>
<P>
Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the
United States, argued that the findings show there is a systemic
problem. He said that following his group's investigation,
slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially
these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would
be audited.
</P>
<P>
"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact
that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this
occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said. "This letter
is not reassuring. This confirms there are major problems with
the inspection program and inadequacies with the law."
</P>
<P>
Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, which
represents packers and processors, said that with the exception
of the suspended plant, the findings "suggest a high degree of
compliance and now an even higher degree of federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants
experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be
reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California
video released in January truly was an anomaly."
