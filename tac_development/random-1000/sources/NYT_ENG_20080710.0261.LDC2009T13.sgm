HEARING NEW IPHONE ' S CALL

HOUSTON
</P>
<P>
Apple's iPhone 3G, the successor to its groundbreaking
smartphone, goes on sale today. But if you've got an older model,
you'll get a new phone of sorts just by plugging it into your
computer running iTunes software.
</P>
<P>
While some folks may be standing in line awaiting the newer
model, owners of the iPhone released just over a year ago will be
receiving iPhone 2.0 software via download. It brings many of the
features found in the newer model to the original -- for free.
</P>
<P>
The new phone will be available at the six Apple and more than 50
AT&amp;amp;T stores in the Houston area starting at 8 a.m. today.
Apple and AT&amp;amp;T representatives were unsure whether the
same kind of lines that formed last year for the iPhone would
reappear this time around.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, there were scattered reports of some people
starting to gather at AT&amp;amp;T stores.
</P>
<P>
The iPhone 3G gets its name from the network to which it connects
for data. AT&amp;amp;T's 3G network is markedly faster than the
older EDGE network, which is what the original iPhone uses.
</P>
<P>
The new phone also can determine its position on the ground using
the Gobal Positioning Satellite system, or GPS.
</P>
<P>
The hardware itself is also cheaper -- at least if you're a new
AT&amp;amp;T customer, an owner of the original iPhone, or an
existing AT&amp;amp;T subscriber who is eligible for a phone
upgrade. For folks in those categories, it will cost just $199
for a model with 8 gigabytes of memory and $299 for the 16-GB
model.
</P>
<P>
If you're not in those groups, you'll pay $399 for the 8-GB and
$499 for the 16-GB models. In all instances, you'll need to sign
a two-year contract. The iPhone 3G will be available without a
contract for $599 and $699, but neither Apple nor AT&amp;amp;T
are selling it that way yet.
</P>
<P>
The original iPhone sold for $399 and $499. When it was first
launched a year ago, the 8-GB model was priced at $599. Two
months later, the price was cut by $200.
</P>
<P>
Though the hardware costs less, the new phone's data plan costs
more. AT&amp;amp;T requires iPhone 3G users to pay $30 for
unlimited data, and that doesn't include text messaging. The
least expensive voice plan for the iPhone 3G is $39. The original
iPhone was sold with a one-price plan for voice and data, the
cheapest of which was under $60.
</P>
<P>
More information about data plans and a checklist you can bring
to either AT&amp;amp;T or Apple stores to speed the process can
be found at www.att.com/iphone.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the first iPhone, which was activated by owners connecting
them to computers running Apple's iTunes software, the newer
version must be activated in stores. Apple and AT&amp;amp;T hope
that transaction will take between 10 to 15 minutes, but you
won't be able to leave the store with an unactivated phone, and
you can't buy one online.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for today's launch, Apple on Thursday released a
new version of iTunes for both Windows and Macintosh. The
software, available either through Apple's Software Update
feature or at www.apple.com/itunes/download, updates the original
iPhone's software for free. Owners of the iPod Touch -- which is
like an iPhone, only without the phone -- must pay $10 for the
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
The new software enables some new features, including the ability
to get e-mail, contacts and calendar information from the
Microsoft Exchange servers used by many businesses; better
support for e-mail attachments; and support for MobileMe, a new
Apple service that lets you sync computers and iPhones over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The new software also lets the iPhone and iPod Touch run third-
party programs. The Apple App store was visible Thursday in
iTunes, but until the iPhone 2.0 software is installed on an
iPhone or iPod Touch, the applications can't be installed.
</P>
<P>
The programs run the gamut from games to remote controls to
social networking clients to news and e-book readers. There were
more than 550 programs available in the App Store on Thursday,
and about one-fourth of them were free.
