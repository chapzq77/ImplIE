American football: Goodell says NFL doping programme doing the
job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New England safety Rodney Harrison will suit up for the Super
Bowl less than a season after serving a drugs ban, but the
National Football League says its anti-doping programme is on
track.
</P>
<P>
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that the league's drug
programme was the "gold standard" in sports and pointed to a NFL
partnership with the US Olympic Committee and baseball to develop
a reliable, economical test for human growth hormone (HGH).
</P>
<P>
Harrison, the only player in NFL history to have at least 30
sacks and 30 interceptions, was suspended for the first four
games of the 2007 season for violating the NFL's policy on banned
substances.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Harrison used HGH, which is on the NFL
banned list, but he has not confirmed what substance it was.
Harrinson has said that it wasn't steroids and that he took it to
help him overcome injuries.
</P>
<P>
The player himself says he has learned from his mistake.
</P>
<P>
"My message to young kids was, 'You make a mistake. Own up to
it,'" he said. "The only way to make amends is to get better as a
person.
</P>
<P>
"When I came back (from the suspension), I had a fire."
</P>
<P>
Goodell said that he did not believe HGH use was rife in the
league.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a significant amount of HGH use, but I
have no factual basis for saying that," he said. "I think our
athletes are extremely well trained. I don't think they want HGH
or performance-enhancing drugs in the game. I think that is why
our drug programme has been so effective, and the gold standard
in sports, because our union supports it."
</P>
<P>
However, players' association chief Gene Upshaw warned Thursday
that the union would not support regular testing for HGH via
blood test.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our players, as big and tough as they are, don't want to
be stuck like a pin cushion," Upshaw said.
