RICHARDSON COVETS ROLE OF CLOSER ON BIG DEALS MICHAEL HAEDERLE
CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM ALBUQUERQUE.

SANTA FE, N.M.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has a reputation for doing
whatever it takes to cajole companies to invest here in his home
state, from giving movie producers his private phone number to
building a special water-treatment plant for a cheese company.
</P>
<P>
A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved
in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable
powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a
handshake.
</P>
<P>
"He's the ideal closer," said Rick Homans, a longtime aide. "We
would set it up and he would close it."
</P>
<P>
In his six years as governor, Richardson, whom President-elect
Barack Obama has chosen to be commerce secretary, has created
80,000 jobs while revamping this impoverished state's economy.
</P>
<P>
The governor has created a thriving film industry here from
scratch and has nurtured a fledgling solar-energy sector, mostly
through tax breaks for investors.
</P>
<P>
He has also persuaded several light manufacturers to set up shop,
attracted investments from high-tech companies, built a commuter
railroad and transformed a sleepy border crossing into a
transportation hub to increase trade with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In perhaps his biggest gamble, Richardson has procured financing
for a spaceport in southern New Mexico, called Spaceport America,
from which he envisions tourists departing on cruises beyond the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"Just about every project he put on the table was big and
visionary and cost a lot of money," said Teri Cole, the president
of the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce. "He's not one to
spend a lot of time on small projects."
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether Richardson can do something similar
on the national level. Obama has said he wants his commerce
secretary to play a pivotal role in salvaging the economy, and
aides to Richardson say they expect that he will try to expand
the traditional role of the office.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to elevate this office to a level of importance that
it genuinely deserves during this economic crisis," said Homans,
who is the state tax commissioner. "He's going to be, in some
respects, reinventing the Department of Commerce."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said at a news conference here on Thursday that he
would apply to the national economy some of the same principles
he used to create jobs in New Mexico. "Obviously," he said, "we
need to rebuild America's economy, domestically and
internationally, create jobs and get ourselves out of this
stagnant situation."
</P>
<P>
But economists and political opponents point out that Richardson
has benefited from record-high oil and natural gas prices during
his tenure as governor. As a result, state coffers were
overflowing with revenue from taxes on oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax
nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks
to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for
every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas revenue also made it easier to finance big
projects, like the $230 million spaceport and a $400 million
commuter railroad from south of Albuquerque to Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that job growth, too, owed a lot to the boom in
the oil and natural gas fields. With the price of oil plummeting,
the growth in jobs has leveled off here and a projected $500
million shortfall has opened up in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Still, no one doubts the state would be worse off in the current
recession had it not been for Richardson's success in attracting
investment and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders whom Richardson has wooed say he is a tough
negotiator, hard to resist one on one.
</P>
<P>
Gerald J. Fine, the president of Schott North America, recalled
how in January Richardson, who was then running for president,
took the time to personally negotiate a deal under which Schott
would build a $100 million plant in Albuquerque to make solar
energy panels.
</P>
<P>
"It was the only time I've ever been given a presidential
candidate's cell phone number by a presidential candidate," Fine
said.
</P>
<P>
Just before the New Hampshire primary, Richardson met with the
company's board chairman, Udo Ungeheuer, at a hotel in Concord.
</P>
<P>
After they went over the fine points of the agreement,
Richardson, a physically imposing man, suddenly stood and reached
a big hand over the table and asked, "Do we have a deal?"
Ungeheuer was taken aback, but a few seconds later shook on it,
according to people who were present.
</P>
<P>
"The way the deal was sealed was with a handshake, and he made
sure he got that handshake before he left the room," said Fine,
still sounding somewhat incredulous. "We built a plant in New
Mexico on the basis of a handshake."
</P>
<P>
Some of Richardson's detractors, however, say he can be
overbearing and vicious when he does not get his way. He enjoys
the limelight that comes from his visionary pronouncements, they
say, and he is impatient with opponents.
</P>
<P>
"It's his way or the highway," said the state Senate president
pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat who has clashed with
the governor over spending. "Anyone who dares to differ with him,
he doesn't take very well."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the growth of the film industry in New Mexico
attests to Richardson's skills as a salesman and deal-closer.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking office in 2003, the governor went to
Hollywood to meet with the heads of major studios. "To a person,
their mouths were agape, as if to say, 'Is this guy really
here?"' recalled Eric Witt, a deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
But Richardson has lured producers, one by one, from large
Hollywood studios to New Mexico with tax abatements and personal
pressure.
</P>
<P>
He urges producers to call him directly in case they run into
hurdles in procuring permits, visits the sets and regularly holds
dinners for actors and producers at the governor's mansion. Since
2003, more than 115 feature films and television series have been
made here, among them the Oscar-winning "No Country for Old Men."
</P>
<P>
"Richardson was smart enough to see this would work," said Nick
Smerigan, who heads the newly built Albuquerque Studios, several
large soundstages on the desert flatlands. "He did it
methodically, slowly, understanding the beast."
