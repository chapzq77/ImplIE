NY prosecutor: Jealous boyfriend brutalized cat

NEW YORK 2008-09-18 11:13:23 UTC

<P>
A trial has begun in the case of a baseball player-turned-actor
accused of brutally killing a cat in a jealous rage after
complaining that his ex-girlfriend cared more for the feline than
she did for him.
</P>
<P>
Assistant District Attorney Leila Kermani said the cat named
Norman died with broken teeth, broken ribs, a broken leg, a torn
tongue, massive internal injuries including bruised lungs and a
bruised liver and a chest cavity filled with blood.
</P>
<P>
"The defendant, in a fit of anger and rage, beat a defenseless
animal to death," Kermani told the jury in her opening remarks
Wednesday. "The defendant killed Norman simply because he was an
angry, jealous and drunken bully."
</P>
<P>
Former New York Mets baseball minor leaguer Joseph Petcka, 37, is
on trial on charges of aggravated cruelty to animals for killing
Norman on March 27, 2007, after a night of heavy drinking. He
faces up to two years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Petcka's lawyer, Charles Hochbaum, admitted his client kicked the
8-year-old tabby and "swatted him really hard" after the cat bit
him, but he said his client did not mean to kill him.
</P>
<P>
"This was a tragic accident," Hochbaum said. "It was not
intentional."
</P>
<P>
Hochbaum complained the district attorney's office never offered
his client a plea deal. He said outside court he believes that
was because of the publicity the case attracted and the urgings
of cat fanciers.
</P>
<P>
Norman's owner, Lisa Altobelli, testified she had dated Petcka
about six weeks before he killed her cat. She said one night they
quarreled and he began drinking heavily. She said she went to bed
to avoid him but he woke her around 3 a.m. by putting his knee in
her ribs and complaining that Norman had attacked him.
</P>
<P>
Altobelli, a Sports Illustrated reporter, said she left the
apartment after Petcka refused to calm down.
</P>
<P>
She said Petcka had complained, "You love that cat more than you
love me," but she had no idea Norman would be in danger. When she
returned home Norman did not meet her at the door as usual. She
found his body under her bedside table.
</P>
<P>
Petcka, a pitcher briefly in the Mets' minor league system in
1992, later appeared in a paper towel commercial and had small
roles in "Sex and the City" and other television shows. Hochbaum
said his client had more recently worked as a bartender and
waiter.
