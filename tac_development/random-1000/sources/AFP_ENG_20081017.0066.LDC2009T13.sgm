Ice hockey: NHL bans Peca five games for grabbing referee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbus Blue Jackets center Michael Peca was handed a five-game
suspension by National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman on
Friday for grabbing a referee by the arm during an October 10
game.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Canadian pleaded his case to Bettman on Thursday
in an appeal over the incident, which came in a 5-4 over-time
triumph at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Peca has already served two games of what had been an indefinite
suspension but will be unable to return to the Columbus lineup
until next Friday's game against the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year veteran will also forfeit 35,349 dollars in salary
for violating Rule 41 regarding physical abuse of an official at
5:21 of the second period following a goal by the Stars.
</P>
<P>
Peca grabbed the arm of referee Greg Kimmerly, solely to obtain
the official's attention according to Peca, while complaining
about the play.
</P>
<P>
Peca received a 10-minute misconduct for verbal abuse of Kimmerly
and a game misconduct for the arm grab under physical abuse rules
that mandate automatic bans of three, 10 or 20 games.
</P>
<P>
The violation was first regarded as a 10-game ban but Bettman
reviewed Peca's testimony and a video replay of the incident with
the four officials who worked the game, who agreed a three-game
ban was more fitting.
</P>
<P>
Bettman used his power to add two games to the ban for what was
called "physically demeaning" conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Michael Peca crossed the line by making physical contact with
referee Kimmerly," Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
"His conduct, regardless of the type or nature of precipitating
events, was inexcusable and showed a lack of respect for our
officials and for the game itself."
