Tennis: Gonzalez saves five match points to beat Gulbis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Gonzalez fought off five match points before defeating
Latvia's Ernests Gulbis 4-6, 7-6 (13/11), 6-1 to reach the
quarter-finals of the Austrian Open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number two seed from Chile, who the day before had needed 138
minutes to dispose of Simone Bolelli, was on court for a further
130 minutes before securing his victory.
</P>
<P>
Gulbis, a French Open quarter-finalist, stretched the more
experienced Gonzalez all the way in the opening two sets with his
more varied game keeping his opponent guessing.
</P>
<P>
Mixing penetrating groundstrokes, frequent use of the dropshot
and often playing serve and volley, he immediately recovered a
break to level the first set at 3-3 and then broke against for
the set with a perfectly executed drop volley.
</P>
<P>
Both players had break point opportunities in the second set,
before Gulbis netted a weak backhand to give Gonzalez a break for
5-4. But the Chilean failed to serve out the set, and then was
also unable to convert any of three break points at 5-5 as the
set moved to a dramatic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Gulbis held five match points in the 24-point tiebreak, before a
double-fault allowed Gonzalez to level the match on his third set
point.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez quickly established a lead in the deciding set, giving
up just four points in the first three games before a final
break, to love, left him serving for victory.
</P>
<P>
"There were many match points and he was in control of the
match," said Gonzalez. "Most of the time I was the guy who was
running and trying to reach some balls, and he was the one who
was going for it every time.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm happy the way that I turned back the match and in the
end I won 6-1 and that's really good for my confidence. Maybe I'm
not playing my best tennis and not feeling my forehand like I
used to, but anyway I'm fighting and I'm still winning."
</P>
<P>
Third seed Juan Martin Del Potro from Argentina, playing his
first match as a member of the world's top 10, withstood a
spirited challenge from 219th-ranked wild card Martin Fischer,
beating the Austrian 7-6 (9/7), 7-6 (7/5) to reach the second
round.
</P>
<P>
Del Potro saved a set point in the first set tiebreak before
claiming it on his own third set point. Fischer also had an
opportunity to claim the second set, breaking to lead 5-4 but
then dropping his serve to love.
</P>
<P>
Fischer continued to challenge and served at 5-4 in tiebreak
before Del Potro sealed victory on his third match point.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Philipp Petzschner followed up his victory over top
seed Stanislas Wawrinka by beating Czech qualifier Jan Hernych
6-3, 6-4, and fifth seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco overwhelmed
Argentina's Guillermo Canas 6-1, 6-2.
