Top US generals in Iraq defend pause in troop reductions, say
security gains could be lost

WASHINGTON 2008-05-22 04:04:26 UTC
</P>
<P>
The U.S. must be careful not to withdraw forces from Iraq too
quickly because security gains could be lost, the country's top
two war generals warn.
</P>
<P>
The position of Gen. David Petraeus, nominated to assume control
of U.S. forces in the Middle East, and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno,
picked to replace Petraeus as the top commander in Iraq, all but
guarantees that some 140,000 troops will be committed in Iraq for
the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
The nominations, if approved by the Senate as expected, would
keep the administration on its present course in Iraq and hand
the next administration a pair of combat-tested commanders who
have relentlessly defended President George W. Bush's decision
last year to build up troop levels rather than wind down the war.
</P>
<P>
"There is no simple metric or calculation that can give us a
green or red light on further reductions," wrote Odierno in a
lengthy question-and-answer document submitted to the panel in
advance of a hearing scheduled Thursday before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Various factors will be considered, but "I will rely most heavily
on my subordinate commanders' recommendations and my own
independent judgment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two Army generals were set to testify before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, giving Democrats a chance to question them on
when more troops might come home and whether the U.S. war effort
in Iraq has aggravated the violence there.
</P>
<P>
Last year, both generals were integral to crafting and
implementing Bush's new military strategy in Iraq, which included
the deployment of 30,000 additional troops.
</P>
<P>
Petraeus has recommended, and Bush has agreed, to withdraw the
extra troops by July but to halt further reductions after that.
Petraeus has said he needs a 45-day period of evaluation and then
an indefinite period of assessment before he could recommend
further pullouts.
</P>
<P>
In his response to the committee, Petraeus reports that violence
in Iraq last week was at its lowest levels in a month with trend
lines indicating that security has improved.
</P>
<P>
"Having noted that, progress is uneven and difficult challenges
remain" including meddling by Iran and continued attacks by al-
Qaida and sectarian militants, Petraeus wrote.
</P>
<P>
But, he later added, "we have seen more unity across sectarian
lines at the national level, and this presents opportunities for
further progress."
</P>
<P>
Petraeus was picked to replace Navy Adm. William J. Fallon as
chief of U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida. The command's
area of responsibility includes some of the most troubling hot
spots: Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon, parts of Africa and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Fallon resigned last month, saying news reports that he was at
odds with the White House over Iran policy had become a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
Odierno spent 15 months as Petraeus' top deputy before being
nominated as the top commander in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Presidential campaign politics will likely be on display Thursday
with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as a panel member. Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the committee, is
expected to miss the hearing because he is in California.
