LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Des Browne has banned the military
personnel from selling their stories to the media on Monday until
a review of the rules is completed.
</P>
<P>
The ban follows the backlash to the British naval crew selling
their stories about their ordeal in Iran to newspapers and
televisions.
</P>
<P>
Browne said he recognized the dilemma faced by the Royal Navy
over its decision to allow the sailors among the 15 hostages to
take payment in return for their accounts.
</P>
<P>
Everyone recognized it had "not reached a satisfactory outcome"
and ordered the ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be sure those charged with these difficult decisions
have clear guidance for the future," he said. "Until that time,
no further service personnel will be allowed to talk to the media
about their experiences in return for payment."
</P>
<P>
A review of procedures has been ordered by the Ministry of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
Leading Seaman Faye Turney and some of her colleagues have been
selling their stories to newspapers and televisions.
</P>
<P>
British politicians, former military officers and some relatives
of soldiers killed in Iraq over the weekend criticized the
decision by the Royal Navy to allow the crew to sell their
stories.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, 15 British sailors and marines were seized by
Iranian forces when they were patrolling off the Iraqi borders.
Iran has insisted that the British boats illegally entered its
territorial waters, while Britain said its soldiers were in Iraqi
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the sailors and marines flew back to the UK after
having been detained by Iran for nearly two weeks, and reunited
with their families.
</P>
<P>
The day after returning home, six of the 15 freed military
personnel had a news conference in southwest England, and issued
a joint statement about their capture in the northern Gulf and
subsequent detention.
