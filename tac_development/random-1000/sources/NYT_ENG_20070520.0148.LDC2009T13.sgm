8 KILLED AS ISRAEL HITS A HAMAS POLITICIAN'S GAZA HOME Isabel
Kershner reported from Jerusalem and Taghreed El-Khodary from
Gaza City.      JERUSALEM -- The Israeli air force struck the
home of a Hamas parliament member in Gaza on Sunday night,
killing eight people, Palestinian hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
The member of parliament, Khalil al-Hayya, was not in the house
at the time.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after the Israeli government announced that
it would intensify its military operations in Gaza in an effort
to halt Palestinian rocket fire into Israel. Separately, an
Egyptian-brokered cease-fire reached on Saturday appeared to take
hold in Gaza, after a week of fierce factional fighting between
Fatah and its rival, Hamas.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokeswoman, Capt. Noa Meir, said that according
to the army's initial findings, the army "identified and hit a
five-member terrorist cell based on prior intelligence -- they
were the target of the attack."
</P>
<P>
Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said that the dead
included seven members of Hayya's family, including three of his
brothers, and a neighbor. Hayya, 44, who arrived at the hospital
surrounded by supporters shortly after the attack, said that his
brothers were "part of the Palestinian people" and had nothing to
do with politics. "This will not divert us from the resistance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian medical officials also said Sunday night that six
children were wounded when an Israeli tank shell hit a house in
Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza. "The tank fired at a point from
which at least two rockets had been launched," Meir said. "I want
to emphasize that the rockets were being launched from officers'
buildings in a civilian area."
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday, Miri Eisin, spokeswoman for the Israeli prime
minister, Ehud Olmert, had said that the focus of the Israeli
military operations would be on Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the
factions that have been the main perpetrators of the rocket
attacks. She added that if the intensified operations were not
successful, Israel's security Cabinet would consider "more
drastic steps." She would not specify what the more drastic
measures might include.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military operations in Gaza started after Hamas resumed
rocket fire against Israel on Tuesday, but Israel's targets had
been the cells firing the rockets or Hamas military headquarters.
Overnight, the Israeli air force struck members of a Hamas cell
traveling in a car; a vehicle carrying a large amount of
explosives belonging to Hamas; and three buildings where weapons
were being produced, an army spokesman said. Four Hamas militants
were killed in the car, said medical officials at Shifa Hospital.
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, at least 12 rockets landed in Israel, the army
spokesman said. Several hit the Karni crossing between Gaza and
Israel, three fell in the Israeli border town of Sderot, causing
damage but no casualties, and one set fire to a restaurant in a
nearby kibbutz.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 rockets have been launched at Israel since Tuesday,
according to the army.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government also said it would expedite the building
of protected spaces in private homes for residents of Sderot,
which has been hardest hit by the rocket fire.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement on Sunday angered many Sderot
residents, who said the action did not go far enough, Many were
hoping that Olmert would order a re-invasion of the Gaza Strip,
from which Israel withdrew in 2005, and some took to the streets
in protest.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Eli Moyal has complained that in the six years since the
rockets started falling on the town, the government has only
managed to fortify schools and kindergartens, which have been
closed for the past few days. "The municipal sports center is not
protected, nor is this," Moyal said on Thursday, referring to his
own top-floor office in the modest City Hall.
</P>
<P>
Though the number of Israeli deaths from the crude and inaccurate
rockets from Gaza has been relatively low -- eight civilians
since 2001, according to the police -- Sderot's residents have
been affected physically and psychologically by the continued
threat, say social service professionals in the town.
</P>
<P>
"People are exhausted; they don't sleep at night, and the
tiredness magnifies all their other problems," said Limor Yashar,
a social worker who runs programs for children at risk. "People
are sleeping under stairwells for protection, together with their
children. There is no privacy. Older children are wetting their
beds, or will only sleep with the lights on."
</P>
<P>
The internal cease-fire reached in Gaza was the fifth in a week;
the previous ones have broken down after only minutes or hours.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza City, schools, stores and businesses reopened Sunday and
people resumed their lives after a week of self-imposed curfew
because of the clashes. But the atmosphere remained tense between
Fatah and Hamas, which share power in a unity government that has
come under strain.
</P>
<P>
Some of the heaviest fighting in the past week took place around
the Al Nour building, a residential block of 52 apartments next
to the headquarters of the Hamas police militia known as the
Executive Force.
</P>
<P>
Nahidh Abu Rahma, 46, a lawyer who lives near the Al Nour
building, said Sunday that he was skeptical about the chances for
the latest cease-fire. "Many were killed," he said of the
factional clashes. "You are talking here about revenge and
reactions." He said he had decided to try to go to the United
States to live.
</P>
<P>
Many local residents who witnessed the factional fighting said
that the Islamist forces of Hamas appeared to be the more
dedicated fighters, attributing that to their religious
conviction.
</P>
<P>
Still, the consensus in Gaza was that there was no clear winner,
a view backed by some Israeli security experts. "It was a bit of
a draw," said Jonathan Fighel, a colonel in the reserves who
follows Palestinian movements at the Institute for Counter-
Terrorism in Herzliya.
</P>
<P>
Fighel said that Israel still has not found a good technological
answer to the primitive rockets from Gaza, and that the current
military action, consisting of air strikes and some tank
shelling, had been "more of the same, and ineffective."
</P>
<P>
Hamas is still highly motivated, he added, suggesting that Israel
should "hit the Palestinians in a different dimension, to restore
deterrence." Israel, he said, had other options like cutting off
electricity and water supplies to Gaza and killing high-ranking
Hamas members, "including ministers."
