BOSNIA BIGGER WORRY THAN KOSOVO

2008 will be a pivotal year for both Kosovo and Bosnia. Kosovo
will likely declare independence from Serbia in the next few
months. If it does, the United States and most members of the
European Union will recognize Kosovo, but will insist upon the
establishment of an international mission similar to the United
Nations Office of the High Representative in Bosnia to ensure the
new state's stability.
</P>
<P>
Serbia and its patron Russia will strongly oppose any move
towards independence by Kosovo, but what form that opposition
will take is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some news reports, Serbia will not demand control of
the Serb entity in Bosnia - or Republika Srpksa (RS) - in
exchange for the loss of Kosovo. Doing so would almost certainly
lead to a direct confrontation with the United States and
European Union. Neither Serbia nor Russia wants that.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tensions surrounding Kosovo's independence, a full-
scale conflict is unlikely. And despite the sentiment in some
quarters for Kosovo remaining an autonomous province of Serbia,
the prospects of that occurring are close to zero.
</P>
<P>
An independent Kosovo will be a weak state for many years to
come, but it will not be (or allowed to be) a threat to the
region. Meanwhile, the political future of Bosnia is murky. For
almost two years, Bosnian politicians have quarreled, often quite
bitterly, about the constitutional future of the country. The
Bosnian Serbs and to a lesser degree the Bosnian Croats, both
minorities in relation to the Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks), have
sought to consolidate their political status under Annex 4 (the
constitution) of the Dayton Agreement.
</P>
<P>
For the Serbs, now lead by the powerful RS Prime Minister Milorad
Dodik, the goal is preservation of their entity and a weak
central government. The Bosniaks, on the other hand, under the
leadership of Haris Silajdzic, have pushed for a strong central
government.
</P>
<P>
The international community has tried without much success to
navigate these opposing positions. A set of amendments to the
constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but
preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds
majority in parliament. EU-led efforts at police reform were
likewise rejected in October.
</P>
<P>
In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav
Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced
two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of
national legislation easier. These reforms essentially challenged
the practice of elected representatives and government ministers
of absenting themselves from key votes.
</P>
<P>
RS politicians, who frequently deployed this tactic to avoid
being outvoted, interpreted these reforms as a threat to the
entity and to their ethnic protections at the state level. They
provoked a crisis by demanding that the High Representative
rescind his measures. With support from Serbia and Russia, RS
Prime Minister Dodik threatened the secession of the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
?  In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the
issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The political situation is now fraught with uncertainty for a
number of reasons. First, the international community is anxious
to end the U.N.'s Dayton mission and turn the reform effort over
to the EU.?  However, the events of the past six months have
clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to
go it alone.
</P>
<P>
Second, during the past year the RS economy has grown rapidly
while that of the other entity, the Bosniak-Croat Federation, has
stagnated. The RS may not be hesitant about using its new
economic power to push for more devolution of political power.
Bosnia is at a precipice.
</P>
<P>
If the international community commits itself to finishing the
job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a
constitutional government capable of serving all the people of
Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future
of the country will brighten considerably.
</P>
<P>
If, however, the international community turns its back on
Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political
dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous
than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next
year. In view of the enormous investment that the international
community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the
DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the
heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.
