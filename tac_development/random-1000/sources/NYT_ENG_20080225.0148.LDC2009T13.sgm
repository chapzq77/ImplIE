New York Times from Baghdad, Hilla, Karbala, Samarra and Diyala.
BAGHDAD
</P>
<P>
Another attack on Shiite pilgrims marching to the holy city of
Karbala killed at least four people on Monday, just a day after a
suicide bombing left 52 dead.
</P>
<P>
In the latest attack, two car bombs exploded in the Karada
district of southeast Baghdad, killing four people and wounding
at least nine, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The blasts were the third attack on Shiite pilgrims observing
Arbaeen, which commemorates the end of the 40-day mourning for
the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and
one of Shiite Islam's most revered holy men.
</P>
<P>
At least 57 pilgrims have been killed during two days of attacks
and more than 100 have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn this atrocity against innocent Iraqi citizens who
were exercising their right to participate in a religious
commemoration," said Col. Allen Batschelet, the chief of staff at
Multinational Division Baghdad.
</P>

In the remote mountains of northern Iraq on Monday, Turkey's
military for a fourth day battled fighters from the Kurdistan
Workers' Party, known as the PKK, attacking Kurdish hide-outs
with fighter jets and ground artillery.
</P>
<P>
Monday's fighting brought the death toll to 17 Turkish soldiers
and as many as 153 Kurdish fighters, the Turkish military said,
though the PKK has reported far lower numbers of its own deaths.
</P>
<P>
Farther south, neither the continuing violence nor the rainstorms
that swept over central Iraq on Monday stopped the thousands of
Shiite pilgrims walking along highways, bearing red, green and
black banners to the Shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala for the
Arbaeen observance.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi security officials announced new measures to safeguard the
pilgrims, and the minister of state for national security,
Shirwan al-Waeli, was investigating the circumstances of Sunday's
bombing in Iskandariya, 45 miles south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aqeel al-Khazaaly, the governor of Karbala, estimated that 5
million pilgrims had traveled to the city by Monday and said he
expected more than 9 million by the time the commemoration ends
Thursday. Maj. Gen. Ali Ghedan of the Iraqi army said he had
deployed additional soldiers to reinforce security along roads
leading to Karbala.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Babel provincial police chief reassigned the
Iskandariya police chief and staged joint raids with U.S.
officials in neighborhoods near the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a police station in Samarra, 60 miles north of Baghdad, a
suicide bomber in a wheelchair killed a police general and
wounded two other people, according to Iraqi police officials.
</P>
<P>
Violence also swept through Diyala province, just north of
Baghdad. Gunmen killed an Iraqi man in a garage in Baquba and a
woman in a residential area on the city's southern outskirts. In
Balad Ruz, about 15 miles west of Baquba, an improvised bomb
detonated near an Iraqi security official's house, wounding two
people.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Diyala province, U.S. forces in Khan Bani Sad killed
a suspected insurgent during a raid.
</P>
<P>
In the northern city of Mosul, U.S. military officials announced
Monday that insurgents fired on a military convoy on Sunday,
killing an Iraqi boy who was playing in the street nearby.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, U.S. troops detained Hafidh al-Beshara, the news
editor of a prominent Shiite-run television station, and his son
in a Friday night raid aimed at disrupting Iranian-backed militia
groups, The Associated Press reported Monday. Troops had sought
the son in the raid, but Beshara was detained as well after an
unauthorized machine gun was found on the premises, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have withheld precise figures for the number of
soldiers involved in the Turkish military's ground operation
against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. But Turkey's ambassador
to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said the figure initially
cited by Turkish news media -- 10,000 troops -- had been "very
exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in a telephone interview: "This operation
will be limited in size, scope and duration. It has one target
and one target alone and that is PKK terrorist organization."
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, a ghoulish video showing the executions of 12
Nepalese contract workers surfaced on jihadist Web sites on
Monday. The men had been kidnapped in 2004, and their abduction
highlighted the peril faced by tens of thousands of so-called
"third-country nationals" working in Iraq, many of them from
impoverished nations, working for little pay and few benefits.
</P>
<P>
The video shows insurgents decapitating a man and shooting
others.
