Buyout for medical device maker Biomet rises to 11.4 bln dlrs
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A private equity buyout of US medical device group Biomet Inc.
was boosted to 11.4 billion dollars, the company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Biomet, which makes joint replacement devices and other
orthopedic products, said its board unanimously recommended the
deal to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The private equity funds backing Biomet's buyout -- Blackstone
Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
and Co. and TPG -- had struck a deal last year for a 10.9
billion-dollar acquisition.
</P>
<P>
But last month, Institutional Shareholder Services, a research
firm for shareholders, recommended against the deal, saying it
was low in view of the growing market for prosthetic devices.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the proposed price for the transaction is fair to
Biomet's shareholders," Biomet chairman Niles Noblitt said.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that the investor group's tender offer will
deliver superior value to Biomet's shareholders in a more
efficient and more immediate fashion than the process provided by
the original merger agreement. Moreover, this revised offer
provides greater certainty and visibility to completion of the
transaction."
</P>
<P>
The deal requires 75 percent of shareholders to accept the offer,
which amounts to 46 dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
Biomet, which produces artificial hips and other replacement and
orthopedic devices as well as spinal products, had previously
engaged in preliminary merger talks with British medical
equipment maker Smith and Nephew.
</P>
<P>
It distributes its products in over 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the company retained Morgan Stanley to assist in
exploring strategic alternatives.
