- The word "courage" gets tossed around a lot in sports, often in
reference to a player who makes an important shot or sinks a
winning putt.
</P>
<P>
We gained a new appreciation for the term when we visited the
Sports Museum of America and read about Aja Frary. When she was
15, her stepfather tried to force her to give up sports. Frary
refused and left home, moving in with her grandparents. She went
on to star in three sports at Seattle's Evergreen High and earned
a college scholarship, eventually becoming one of the top track
athletes in the country.
</P>
<P>
We also learned about a dad in California who questioned his
daughter's team being booted off a field so a boys' squad could
practice, and found that local facilities for girls were sorely
lacking. His documenting of the inequity forced the school
district to balance access to playing fields.
</P>
<P>
"You come away from a visit to the museum more impressed with the
people you didn't know about than those you did know," said Jim
Craig of Easton, goaltender for the 1980 US Olympic "Miracle on
Ice" hockey team.
</P>
<P>
Craig, 51, an honorary trustee, helped usher the museum into its
historic space in the Financial District two months ago. He also
loaned the museum the flag that someone draped over him in the
tumult after the US team captured the gold medal against the
Soviets. The resulting photo is one of sports' iconic images.
</P>
<P>
Certainly this museum is more than a repository of artifacts,
although it can claim some dandies: college football's Heisman
Trophy, for which it is the new permanent home; Jesse Owens's
diary from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin; the 6-iron used by
astronaut Alan Shepard to hit a golf ball on the moon; even the
world's most famous sports bra, worn by Brandi Chastain when she
converted the penalty kick that clinched the World Cup for the US
women's soccer team in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Also on display in the lobby is a faux Statue of Liberty, garbed
in Red Sox robes, one of 42 such statues placed throughout the
city to promote Tuesday's All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
But this museum shines most when it backs away from the hoopla,
and shows us our heroes when they were youngsters with dreams;
when it assesses the impact of an immigrant like Boston boxing
champ John L. Sullivan on his community; when it shows how games
helped us heal after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina.
</P>
<P>
"Some people would minimize sports' role in our culture," said
Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder. "But my goal, going back 6?
years now, is to show the power of sports to impact lives."
</P>
<P>
Schwalb's life changed in a matter of 24 hours, when he visited
the Basketball Hall of Fame for the first time on Sept. 10, 2001
(his 39th birthday), and lamented the absence of an all-sports
museum in the United States. The attacks the next day spurred him
to pursue his goal of a museum that would celebrate all sports,
and to build it in Manhattan. Sixteen months later, the
Basketball Hall of Fame became the first partner.
</P>
<P>
Schwalb speaks warmly of the first athlete to join the advisory
board, Celtics legend Bob Cousy. "We call Bob our patron saint,"
said Schwalb.
</P>
<P>
Cousy, a New York native, was also the subject of a rallying cry
when the fledgling museum was trying to gain its footing.
</P>
<P>
"The mayor had given us the use of Gracie Mansion for a meeting
with the deputy mayor for economic development, and we wanted
noteworthy athletes to join us," said Schwalb. "We had four or
five lined up, but as time went on the others kept canceling.
Finally, only Cousy was left, so our slogan was 'Don't lose the
Cooz."'
</P>
<P>
Another Hall of Famer, Bill Bradley, steered the project toward
Lower Manhattan, which resulted in Schwalb's group securing
Liberty bonds, part of a federal initiative to revitalize the
area. Just a dozen or so businesses out of some 300 applicants
won approval, and that landed the museum $60 million of its
required $100 million.
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid in Orlando, playing ball in the driveway, I
would pretend I was Bill Bradley," said Schwalb of the onetime
New York Knick. "Imagine coming home one day to find a voice mail
from him about our project."
</P>
<P>
The 19 galleries brim with the top players in the leading sports.
Schwalb worked to align the museum with every important governing
body and hall of fame, and he landed the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y., just a month before opening.
</P>
<P>
What did those organizations have to gain? As in many sports
stories, the statistics are telling.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the Basketball Hall of Fame, they work hard, they
hold special events, and they get just over 100,000 visitors a
year," says Schwalb. "There must be what, 30 million basketball
fans in this country? And a lot of them don't even know the Hall
of Fame is in Springfield."
</P>
<P>
Schwalb estimates that an annual 7 million visitors make their
way to Battery Park and its ferries to Ellis Island and the
Statue of Liberty. The museum is about 50 yards from the park,
right across the street from the famous "charging bull" statue
symbolic of Wall Street, a couple of blocks from Ground Zero, and
at the starting point for ticker-tape parades down Broadway, the
mile-long "Canyon of Heroes" leading to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of sidewalk medallions commemorate the early parades, such
as the salute to Charles Lindbergh in 1927, and Schwalb considers
it great karma that the lone two markers for sports parades
(golfer Bobby Jones and swimmer Gertrude Ederle) are both in
front of the museum.
</P>
<P>
"We also have a photo of Jesse Owens in a convertible during his
parade in 1936 that was taken directly in front of our building,"
said Schwalb. The museum sits at 26 Broadway and boasts a
commanding presence in the historic former headquarters of John
D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
"The building is unlike any other we could find," said Schwalb.
"Its facade is 450 feet long, and you'd be hard-pressed to find
another building of that length in New York City."
</P>
<P>
The biggest win-win among sports organizations has to be the
partnership with the Women's Sports Foundation, which was without
a permanent home before it christened the Billie Jean King
International Women's Sports Center as part of the museum.
</P>
<P>
"They were determined to have a physical space for their hall of
fame," said Schwalb. "For 20 years they would have an induction
dinner, and they never had a place to honor the inductees."
</P>
<P>
The museum provides several interactive touches: Fans can lend
the announcer's voice to some classic moments, get behind a
hockey goalie's mask and see a forward bearing down on them with
the puck, gauge their cycling ability, even take a shot at
changing the tires like a member of a pit crew. At the final
kiosk, visitors can learn more about how to visit the various
halls of fame and get on their e-mail lists.
</P>
<P>
"It's better than a single hall of fame and more than a museum,"
said Craig. "I call it a destination for dreams."
