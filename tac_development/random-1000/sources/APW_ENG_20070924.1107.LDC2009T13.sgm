Tense Ahmadinejad questions 9/11, Holocaust after blistering US
reception

NEW YORK 2007-09-24 20:38:23 UTC

<P>
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad questioned the official
version of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and defended the right to
cast doubt on the Holocaust in a tense appearance Monday at
Columbia University, whose president accused him of behaving like
"a petty and cruel dictator."
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad smiled at first but appeared increasingly agitated,
decrying the "insults" and "unfriendly treatment." Columbia
President Lee Bollinger and audience members criticized him over
Iran's human-rights record and foreign policy, as well as
Ahmadinejad's statements denying the Holocaust and calling for
the disappearance of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel
dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
</P>
<P>
He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the
illiterate and ignorant.
</P>
<P>
"When you come to a place like this it makes you simply
ridiculous," Bollinger said. "The truth is that the Holocaust is
the most documented event in human history."
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious
invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information
and the knowledge of the audience here."
</P>
<P>
"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully,"
Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the
influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians. "I should
not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session, Ahmadinejad appeared tense
and unsmiling, in contrast to more relaxed interviews and
appearances earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
In response to one audience, Ahmadinejad denied he was
questioning the existence of the Holocaust: "Granted this
happened, what does it have to do with the Palestinian people?"
</P>
<P>
But then he said he was defending the rights of European
scholars, an apparent reference to a small number who have been
prosecuted under national laws for denying or minimizing the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing known as absolute," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his desire to visit ground zero to express sympathy
with the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but then appeared to
question whether al-Qaida was responsible.
</P>
<P>
"Why did this happen? What caused it? What conditions led to it?"
he said. "Who truly was involved? Who was really involved and put
it all together?"
</P>
<P>
Asked about executions of homosexuals in Iran, Ahmadinejad said
the judiciary system executed violent criminals and high-level
drug dealers, comparing them to microbes eliminated through
medical treatment. Pressed specifically about punishment of
homosexuals, he said: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in
your country."
</P>
<P>
With the audience laughing derisively, he continued: "In Iran we
do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who's told you that we
have this."
</P>
<P>
Bollinger was strongly criticized for inviting Ahmadinejad to
Columbia, and had promised tough questions in his introduction to
Ahmadinejad's talk. But the strident and personal nature of his
attack on the president of Iran was startling.
</P>
<P>
"You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly
uneducated," Bollinger told Ahmadinejad about the leader's
Holocaust denial.
</P>
<P>
During his prepared remarks, the Iranian president did not
address Bollinger's accusations directly.
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings
Institution, said Ahmadinejad's softer tone on Israel in this
speech may reflect backlash in his own country.
</P>
<P>
"There's been widespread commentary in Iran, even on the far-
right, that Ahmadinejad's position on Israel has hurt the
country's diplomatic relations," said Maloney. "The fact that he
was frankly unwilling to go as far as he has in the past suggests
there may have been some consequences for him at home."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush said Ahmadinejad's appearance at
Columbia "speaks volumes about really the greatness of America."
</P>
<P>
He told Fox News Channel that if Bollinger considers
Ahmadinejad's visit an educational experience for Columbia
students, "I guess it's OK with me."
</P>
<P>
Other American officials were less sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, conservatives said Columbia should not have
invited Ahmadinejad to speak. Senate Republican Leader Mitch
McConnell said "there is a world of difference between not
preventing Ahmadinejad from speaking and handing a megalomaniac a
megaphone and a stage to use it."
</P>
<P>
Senator Joseph Lieberman said he thought Columbia's invitation to
Ahmadinejad was a mistake "because he comes literally with blood
on his hands."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people jammed two street blocks across from the
United Nations to protest Ahmadinejad's visit to New York.
Organizers claimed a turnout of tens of thousands. Police did not
immediately have a crowd estimate.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, most of them politicians and officials from Jewish
organizations, proclaimed their support for Israel and criticized
the Iranian leader for his remarks questioning the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"We're here today to send a message that there is never a reason
to give a hatemonger an open stage," New York City Council
Speaker Christine Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters also assembled at Columbia. Dozens stood near the
lecture hall where Ahmadinejad was scheduled to speak, linking
arms and singing traditional Jewish folk songs about peace and
brotherhood, while nearby a two-person band played "You Are My
Sunshine."
</P>
<P>
Signs in the crowd displayed a range of messages, including one
that read "We refuse to choose between Islamic fundamentalism and
American imperialism."
