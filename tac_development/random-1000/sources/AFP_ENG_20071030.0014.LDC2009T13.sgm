American football: Bills to start Losman at quarterback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J.P. Losman will start at quarterback for the Buffalo Bills in
Sunday's National Football League game against Cincinnati,
Buffalo coach Dick Jauron said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Losman came on for injured rookie Trent Edwards against the New
York Jets last weekend and piloted the Bills to a 13-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
Jauron, who just one week earlier had tabbed Edwards as his
starter, said a sprained right wrist suffered by his rookie
quarterback prompted the switch.
</P>
<P>
"J.P. Losman will start Sunday's game against the Cincinnati
Bengals," Jauron said in a statement. "Trent Edwards' wrist will
prevent him from participating until late in the week, if at
all."
</P>
<P>
Edwards had been elevated to the starting role when Losman
suffered an ankle injury in the third week of the season.
