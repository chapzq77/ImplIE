foreign players

Adios Torres. Au revoir Saha. Auf Wiedersehen Ballack.

Bobby Charlton has called for a reduction in the number of
foreign players in the Premier League in a bid to improve
England's national team.
</P>
<P>
"We've begun to bring in too many from overseas. It is a big
problem," the former Manchester United and England player said
Thursday. "You can't really expect to be generating good young
players coming into the game if you're actually, at the same
time, bringing in players that will hinder them getting into the
team."
</P>
<P>
England's injury list has caused problems for coach Steve
McClaren ahead of must-win European Championship qualifiers
against Israel on Saturday and Russia next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think England are really struggling at the moment. They've got
injuries and they don't have the luxury of actually going out and
picking, as they used to do, somebody from every club," said
Charlton, a World Cup champion in 1966. "If you look at it,
England probably has two decent strikers and if one of them gets
injured, as Wayne Rooney is at the moment, we have nobody else."
</P>
<P>
The Premier League has become an attractive -- and lucrative --
destination for foreign players, with the result that homegrown
talent has been squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
Englishmen accounted for just 37 percent of players in the
opening weekend of the season last month -- a drop from 76
percent in 1992, the Premier League's inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
Charlton, who scored a record 49 times in 106 appearances for
England, called for politicians to impose restrictions on foreign
players while acknowledging that such measures were harder to do
now.
</P>
<P>
"It needs some commission or committee to be brought to bear to
really have a good look at it because it is a big problem,"
Charlton said. "We're part of the European Union now and you just
can't do things that we could do in the past. You could stop
people from coming in, if that's what you wanted to do."
</P>
<P>
Charlton, who scored a record 198 times for the Red Devils, said
he was pleased fans could watch some English players at Old
Trafford.
</P>
<P>
"I want, when I get to see the program, to think that there's a
little bit of something local," the United director said. "I
don't want to read that they are all foreign players."
</P>
<P>
Charlton launched his autobiography, "My Manchester United
Years," at Old Trafford on Thursday. In the book, the 69-year-old
Charlton describes falling in love with soccer by kicking a ball
against a wall alone until deep into the night.
</P>
<P>
"Young kids who would normally be playing outside on the streets
with each other can't do that (today) because there are cars
everywhere. They're sidetracked into the house to watch
television and to play the computer games," Charlton said.
"There's no great influx of kids coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
"If it's easier to get players from overseas that's what we might
have to do and sometimes we've had to do that, but it's not what
we want."
