New intelligence report: Al-Qaida may use Iraqi network to attack
U.S.

WASHINGTON 2007-07-17 13:40:23 UTC
</P>
<P>
The terrorist network Al-Qaida will likely leverage its contacts
and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S. soil,
according to a new National Intelligence Estimate on threats to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The declassified key findings, to be released publicly on
Tuesday, were obtained in advance by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The report lays out a range of dangers -- from al-Qaida to
Lebanese Hezbollah to non-Muslim radical groups -- that pose a
"persistent and evolving threat" to the country over the next
three years. As expected, however, the findings focus most of
their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's
al-Qaida network.
</P>
<P>
The report makes clear that al-Qaida in Iraq, which has not yet
posed a direct threat to U.S. soil, could become a problem here.
</P>
<P>
"Of note," the analysts said, "we assess that al-Qaida will
probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of al-
Qaida in Iraq (AQI), its most visible and capable affiliate and
the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the
homeland."
</P>
<P>
The analysts also found that al-Qaida's association with its
Iraqi affiliate helps the group to energize the broader Sunni
Muslim extremist community, raise resources and recruit and
indoctrinate operatives -- "including for homeland attacks."
</P>
<P>
National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative
written judgments of the 16 spy agencies across the breadth of
the U.S. government. These agencies reflect the consensus long-
term thinking of top intelligence analysts. Portions of the
documents are occasionally declassified for public release.
</P>
<P>
The new report echoed statements made by senior intelligence
officials over the last year, including the assessment of spy
agencies that the country is in a "heightened threat
environment." It also provided new details on their thinking and
concerns.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the report says that worldwide counterterrorism
efforts since 2001 have constrained al-Qaida's ability to attack
the U.S. again and convinced terror groups that U.S. soil is a
tougher target.
</P>
<P>
But, the report quickly adds, analysts are concerned "that this
level of international cooperation may wane as 9/11 becomes a
more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge."
</P>
<P>
Among the report's other findings:
</P>
<P>
--Al-Qaida is likely to continue to focus on high-profile
political, economic and infrastructure targets to cause mass
casualties, visually dramatic destruction, economic aftershocks
and fear. "The group is proficient with conventional small arms
and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating
new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
</P>
<P>
--The group has been able to restore key capabilities it would
need to launch an attack on U.S. soil: a safe haven in Pakistan's
tribal areas, operational lieutenants and senior leaders. U.S.
officials have warned publicly that a deal between the Pakistani
government and tribal leaders allowed al-Qaida to plot and train
more freely in parts of western Pakistan for the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
--The group will continue to seek weapons of mass destruction --
chemical, biological or nuclear material -- and "would not
hesitate to use them."
</P>
<P>
--Lebanese Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim extremist group that has
conducted anti-American attacks overseas, may be more likely to
consider attacking here, especially if it believes the United
States is directly threatening the group or its main sponsor,
Iran.
</P>
<P>
--Non-Muslim terrorist groups probably will attack here in the
next several years, although on a smaller scale. The judgments do
not name any specific groups, but the FBI often warns of violent
environmental groups, such as Earth Liberation Front, and others.
</P>
<P>
The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are
part of a longer document, which remains classified. It was
approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
</P>
<P>
In the last week, reports on this document and another threat
assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in
Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right
course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The White House has used the reports as evidence that the country
must continue to go after al-Qaida in Iraq, Afghanistan and
elsewhere. But critics say the evolving threat is evidence of a
policy gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
The debate -- and the underlying global problem -- will not go
away soon.
</P>
<P>
The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas,
especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and
increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries
indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is
expanding.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small
number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ...
points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently
radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as
legitimate," the estimate said. "We assess that this internal
Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in
Europe, however."
