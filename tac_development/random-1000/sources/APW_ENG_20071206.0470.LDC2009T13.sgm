JAKARTA, Indonesia 2007-12-06 09:30:08 UTC

<P>
Authorities have traced a piece of an airplane wing found on a
runway at Indonesia's largest airport to a passenger jet operated
by budget carrier Lion Air, the transport ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said the Boeing MD-90 had been
grounded and authorities were investigating how and when the
piece fell off.
</P>
<P>
Workers found the engine casing, which Ervan said was "several
feet" in length, at Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta airport on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lion Air representatives were not immediately available for
comment.

<P>
Last month, a similar-sized piece of wing fell from a jetliner
minutes after it took off from the same airport. The Boeing 737,
which was operated by a local airline, landed safely but the
incident added to safety concerns about commercial aviation in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The country suffered a series of accidents earlier this year that
killed more than 120 people, leading the European Union to ban
all the country's airlines from landing there.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the industry is plagued by poor maintenance, rule-
bending and a shortage of trained professionals.
