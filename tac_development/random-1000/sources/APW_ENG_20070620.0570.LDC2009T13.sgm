Antigua demands US$3.4 billion trade sanctions against US in
Internet gambling dispute

The United States should face commercial sanctions worth more
than US$3.4 billion (euro2.5 billion) each year for its failure
to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that its
Internet gambling restrictions are illegal, the Caribbean nation
of Antigua and Barbuda said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Antigua, which won a WTO ruling last year against the U.S.
restrictions, is asking the trade body for authorization to
target American trademarks and copyrights if the U.S. refuses to
change its legislation.
</P>
<P>
It said the sanctions would come into effect "shortly," unless
the United States requests a WTO arbitration panel on the level
and scope of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"While we realize this is a significant step for Antigua and
Barbuda to take, we feel we have no other choice in the matter,"
Antigua's Finance Minister L. Errol Cort said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Until such time as the United States is willing to work with us
on achieving a reasonable solution to this trade dispute, we will
continue to use every legitimate remedy available to protect the
interests of our citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
The move by Antigua comes a day after the European Union told the
United States it too wanted compensation for the U.S. ban on
foreign online gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
Antigua argues that before the ban was introduced, online
gambling provided income for hundreds of its citizens and helped
end its reliance on tourism, which was hurt by a series of
hurricanes in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Last year Washington stopped U.S. banks and credit card companies
from processing payments to online gambling businesses outside
the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision closed off the most lucrative region in a market
worth US$15.5 billion (euro11.6 billion) last year. About half of
the world's online gamblers are based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization ruled in December that the law
unfairly targeted offshore casinos, telling the U.S. it could
keep restrictions against sport betting in place if they were
also applied to American businesses.
