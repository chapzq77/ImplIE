Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the
International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his
warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
</P>
<P>
FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which
announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive
test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use
exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.
</P>
<P>
USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee already had said
the warning did not affect Hamm's spot on the team for the
Beijing Games.
</P>
<P>
FIG's announcement came a day after Hamm's twin brother, Paul,
withdrew from the Olympics, saying he won't be healthy enough to
defend his all-around title. Paul Hamm had a broken right hand
and strained left rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from
his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to
reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle. After being
notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of
the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and
letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
</P>
<P>
USADA said it had "absolutely no concern" the shot was for
anything but medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
As part of his punishment, Hamm's results from the second day of
nationals were wiped out. But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the
results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm
would still have made the team.
