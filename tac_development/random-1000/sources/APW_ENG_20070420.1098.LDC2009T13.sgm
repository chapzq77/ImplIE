A Missouri college fired a geography instructor and filed a
report with police after students complained the man had joked
about being a suicide bomber.
</P>
<P>
Ozarks Technical Community College spokesman Joel Doepker said
several students had complained that the teacher walked into
class Wednesday, set his briefcase on a table and said, "I'm a
suicide bomber," the Springfield News-Leader reported in its
Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
"As to the why, I really don't know. But after the class, several
students complained to campus administrators about the comment,"
Doepker said. The part-time instructor was fired Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The students said the comment was inappropriate after the
Virginia Tech massacre this week.
</P>
<P>
Ozark police and the college did not release the teacher's name
pending an investigation.

<P>
The instructor told an investigator "that he did make a comment
that he was a suicide bomber to his classroom as a joke, to
lighten up the mood as the classroom was preparing for a test," a
police statement said.
</P>
<P>
The instructor reportedly felt bad about making the comment after
he was informed by at least one student that the comment was
inappropriate, according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
"Even without the Virginia Tech situation, (the instructor's
comments) still would have been cause for termination," Doepker
said.
