Venezuelans struggle to find milk, chicken, sugar in spite of oil
wealth

CARACAS, Venezuela 2007-11-20 18:41:19 UTC
</P>
<P>
The lines formed at dawn and remained long throughout the day --
hundreds upon hundreds of Venezuelans queuing up to buy scarce
milk, chicken and sugar at state-run outdoor markets staffed by
soldiers in fatigues.
</P>
<P>
President Hugo Chavez's government is trying to cope with
scattered shortages of some foods, and long lines at state-run
"Megamercal" street markets over the weekend show many
Venezuelans are willing to wait for hours to snap up a handful of
products they seldom find in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
"You have to get in line and you have to be lucky," said Maria
Fernandez, a 64-year-old housewife who was buying milk and
chicken on Sunday. She said trying to find milk is a constant
frustration. She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a
private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with
the last can.
</P>
<P>
The long lines for basic foods at subsidized prices are
paradoxical for an oil-rich nation that in many ways is a land of
plenty. Shopping malls are bustling, new car sales are booming
and privately owned supermarkets are stocked with American potato
chips, French wines and Swiss Gruyere cheese.
</P>
<P>
Yet other foods covered by price controls -- eggs, fresh chicken
-- periodically are hard to find in supermarkets. Fresh milk has
become a luxury, and even baby formula is scarcer nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's
economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes
that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for
re-election indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials accuse producers of holding basic goods
off the market to profiteer or to sow discontent among
Venezuela's poor, Chavez's core supporters.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous,
including surging demand due to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government's price controls are also "totally divorced" from
reality -- in some cases below production costs -- making it
unprofitable for suppliers to sell their products at official
prices, said economist Pedro Palma of the Caracas consulting firm
MetroEconomica.
</P>
<P>
More investment is needed in agriculture but the government's
agrarian reform effort -- assuming control of vast farmlands and
offering them to poor farmers -- has made traditional producers
reluctant to invest, he said.
</P>
<P>
And importers also face hurdles. Currency exchange controls
imposed in 2003 by the government require state approval to
obtain dollars at the official rate. Those without approval
regularly turn to the black market, buying dollars for about
three times the fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
To compound the problems, Palma said, some of the products
Venezuela looks to import, such as milk and sugar, are scarce
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Many of those in line at the Megamercal said they are grateful to
Chavez for subsidized markets offering prices far cheaper than
commercial supermarkets. But they also complained of struggling
to find milk, chicken, sugar and cooking oil elsewhere at prices
set by the government.
</P>
<P>
"I arrived at 6 in the morning to get in line," said Doris
Bastida, 32, a mother of four who wheeled an infant son in a
stroller. She had been waiting for about four hours by the time
she reached the entrance.
</P>
<P>
"What am I going to do? I don't have anywhere else to go," she
said. Powdered milk is sold by black-market street vendors at
US$10 (euro6.80) or more per kilogram (US$4.50/euro3 or more per
pound) -- about twice the regulated price and four times the
price offered by the state markets.
</P>
<P>
Bastida said she still believes in Chavez and plans to vote in
favor of his reforms "so that things will get better." Plus, she
said, if "everyone votes 'no,' they're going to take the
Megamercal away from us."
</P>
<P>
Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's
government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run
again in 2012.
</P>
<P>
"We have to vote 'no,'" said 50-year-old Fatima Rodriguez. "Do
you think it's good to be here waiting in line?"
</P>
<P>
Chavez says he is aiming to boost agriculture with projects
including state-supported sugar harvesting and a milk processing
plant started with help from Iran. For now, Venezuela still
imports most of its food, and imports overall have more than
doubled in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's food minister, Gen. Rafael Oropeza, said the open-air
markets were fully stocked across the country over the weekend.
He said leg of pork -- a popular holiday dish -- was imported
because local suppliers declined to participate.
</P>
<P>
"I'm putting out a call to businesses for them to raise
production and respond to the demand," Oropeza said, according to
the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional. He suggested there were
political motives behind the shortages.
</P>
<P>
"That's the objective, that the people reach the point of
desperation," Oropeza said.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Food Industry Chamber denied its members are to
blame, saying they are working to satisfy rapidly growing
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Oropeza said the government sold a record 5,948 metric tons
(6,557 tons) at its weekend markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
At one state market in Caracas, the line snaked around a block,
while soldiers manned barricades at the entrance. A banner hung
above read "Continue on with Chavez." Red campaign signs
plastered on walls urged: "Yes, with Chavez."
</P>
<P>
Factory worker Eugenio Ruiz praised Chavez for the subsidized
food and said he plans to vote "yes" so that Chavez can run
again.
</P>
<P>
"Look at all he's done for us," Ruiz said, explaining he thinks
the situation would be worse without Chavez. "We have to stay
with him, not abandon him."
