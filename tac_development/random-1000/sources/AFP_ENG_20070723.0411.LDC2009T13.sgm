Indonesian prosecutors seek death for Palu bomber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesian prosecutors on Monday recommended the death sentence
for a Muslim militant accused of terrorism, including a market
bomb attack that killed eight people on Sulawesi island.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Rudy Tailang told the South Jakarta district court
that defendant Abdul Muis, alias Muin, 24, was involved in the
December 2005 bombing of a meat market in the restive town of
Palu.
</P>
<P>
Muis "held the remote control that detonated the bomb," Tailang
said, adding that his act killed eight people and injured another
47.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged the bomb attack was carried out together with three
other militants identified as Icang, Dedi Parsan and Ryan. Ryan
was killed during a January police raid in the Central Sulawesi
town of Poso.
</P>
<P>
Muis is also accused of taking part in the assassination of a
Christian minister in Palu in October 2006.
</P>
<P>
Central Sulawesi, especially Palu, and Poso and its surrounding
district, has been the scene of sporadic unrest since violence
between Muslims and Christians claimed around 1,000 lives in 2000
and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The trial resumes next Monday, when the defence case will be
heard.
