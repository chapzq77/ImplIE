' UNCHECKED AND UNBALANCED ' : THE CASE AGAINST THOSE EXPANDING
WHITE HOUSE POWERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Days after 9/11, Bush administration lawyers began laying out a
vision of sweeping executive power, designed to give the
president authority, in the words of John C. Yoo, then deputy
assistant attorney general, "to take whatever actions he deems
appropriate to pre-empt or respond to terrorist threats from new
quarters," whether or not they can be linked to the specific
terrorist incidents of Sept. 11. A Sept. 25, 2001, Justice
Department memo declared that under the Constitution decisions
regarding the "amount of military force to be used" in response
to the terrorist threat, as well as "the method, timing and
nature of the response," are "for the president alone to make."
And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary
international law has no binding legal effect on either the
president or the military."
</P>
<P>
In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced,"
points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand
its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both
Congress and the judiciary. President Bush secretly authorized
the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without obtaining a
court order on calls and e-mail messages sent from the United
States to other countries. He has issued a steady stream of
signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more
than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and
disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority
to limit coercive interrogation tactics. And the administration
has claimed that the president's war powers give him the
authority to detain people indefinitely and deny them access to
lawyers and the courts, policy that it would later be forced to
modify in response to legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
In their chilling and timely book Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr.,
senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law, and Aziz Z. Huq, who directs the
Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center,
argue that the Bush administration's "monarchist claims of
executive power" are "unprecedented on this side of the North
Atlantic," and that its "executive unilateralism not only
undermines the delicate balance of our Constitution, but also
lessens our human liberties and hurts vital counterterrorism
campaigns" by undermining America's moral authority and standing
in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is
heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like
Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of
The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and
Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe. But the book serves as a
valuable compendium and chronicle of the Bush administration's
aggressive efforts to expand the power of the executive branch,
providing a detailed account of the unilateral actions it has
taken on matters ranging from torture policy to domestic
surveillance, and it is necessary reading for anyone interested
in how those efforts by the Bush White House have tipped the
constitutional system of checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz was chief counsel for the Church committee, which
investigated executive branch overreaching in the mid 1970s, and
he and Huq have done a powerful job of situating the actions of
the current White House in perspective with the imperial
presidency of Richard M. Nixon (who once declared that "when the
president does it, that means that it is not illegal"). Equally
devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration
lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential
prerogative. They remind the reader that the founding fathers had
"scant affection for strong executives" like England's king, and
they argue that many of the Bush White House's claims are rooted
in ideas "about the 'divine' right of kings" that "did not
survive the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution of
1688" and that certainly did not find their "way into our
founding documents, the 1776 Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of 1787."
</P>
<P>
Like many reporters Huq and Schwarz point out that expanded
executive power was not a response to the terrorist attacks of
9/11 but the realization of a vision that conservatives like Dick
Cheney had harbored since the 1970s, when they grew aggrieved
over post-Watergate reforms that put the brakes on presidential
power. That conservative backlash gained ground during the
presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in
the minority report of the Iran-contra committee. (The committee
included Cheney and counted among its staff a young lawyer named
David S. Addington, who years later in his role as the vice
president's legal counsel and chief of staff would play a major
role in formulating the administration's post-9/11 legal
strategy.)
</P>
<P>
According to Huq and Schwarz the Iran-contra committee's minority
report asserted that "the Chief Executive will on occasion feel
duty bound to assert monarchical notions of prerogative that will
permit him to exceed the laws," and it also argued that "the
President's inherent powers" had historically allowed the
executive to act "when Congress was silent, and even, in some
cases, where Congress had prohibited an action."
</P>
<P>
As Schwarz and Huq see it, the Bush White House's "broader
efforts to seize unfettered control of national security policy
and to eliminate the checks and balances imposed by Congress and
the courts" is exemplified by its post 9/11 decision "to ignore
legal constraints on torture." In February of 2002 President Bush
signed an order declaring that "none of the provisions of Geneva
apply to our conflict with al Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere
throughout the world," a decision that would set the nation on a
slippery slope toward torture, leading to the abuses at Abu
Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons.
</P>
<P>
In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and
purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately
narrow definition of torture. One 2002 memo defined it as causing
the sort of "intense pain or suffering" ordinarily associated
"with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ
failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant
body function will likely result."
</P>
<P>
Although significant public and congressional attention was
focused on the Patriot Act (which itself created an uproar over
the threat it posed to Americans' civil liberties), Huq and
Schwarz write, "the official responses to the September 11, 2001,
attacks largely took shape through under-the-radar executive
orders" that not only excluded Congress from the debate but in
many cases also circumvented the interagency policy-making
process, cutting out experts from the State Department and
members of the uniformed military.
</P>
<P>
For instance the authors observe that a presidential finding
signed days after 9/11 gave the CIA sweeping new powers to
disrupt terrorist activity and permission to kill, capture and
detain members of Al Qaida anywhere in the world: powers, in the
view of some intelligence officers, that included the implicit
authority to create black sites (secret detention facilities
outside the United States, where terrorism suspects could be held
beyond the Bush's signing of a 2002 presidential order
authorizing NSA surveillance in the homeland without a court-
approved warrant, an order that effectively circumvented the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed by Congress in
1978. Although briefings were provided to a handful of
congressional leaders, Schwarz and Huq report, those leaders were
prohibited from saying anything about them to anyone, including
other intelligence committee members, a stipulation that "gutted
the possibility of effective oversight."
</P>
<P>
"Making the executive supreme makes the nation no safer -- either
from its enemies or its own worse impulses," the authors
conclude. "Indeed, the abiding genius of the Founding Generation
was its rejection of the idea that unchecked unilateral power is
ever properly vested in any one branch of government. Our
government was framed 'to control itself,' as James Madison wrote
in the Federalist Papers. 'Ambition must be made to counteract
ambition.' Dividing powers between three branches, the Founders
harnessed human passions in the cause of limited government.
Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the
enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The
accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary,
in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether
hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced
the very definition of tyranny."'
