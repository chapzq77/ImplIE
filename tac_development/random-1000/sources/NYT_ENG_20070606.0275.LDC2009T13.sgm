BRAZILIAN NUMBERS GAME TIES OFFICIALS TO MOBSTERS

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil
</P>
<P>
The illegal lottery known as "the animal game" is as visible a
part of the urban landscape here as Ipanema beach or Sugarloaf
Mountain. On thousands of street corners, vendors sit all day at
little wooden booths, pads of paper in hand, taking money from
bettors, who return later to check results posted on lampposts or
walls.
</P>
<P>
The bosses of the billion-dollar industry known in Portuguese as
the "jogo do bicho," on the other hand, have long preferred to
operate in the shadows. That was, at least, until a burgeoning
corruption scandal suddenly thrust them into an uncomfortable
national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges,
police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run
the game. More than 40 people face criminal charges, mounds of
documents have been seized and $6 million in cash has been
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Among those jailed are some of the wealthiest and most powerful
of the game's kingpins, as well as judges accused of issuing
favorable rulings to keep the game running in return for payoffs,
sometime as much as $15,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
Yet for all the talk of a crackdown, the game goes on. And to
Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship
between those who control the game and those who make and enforce
the laws.
</P>
<P>
"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a
certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise
Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the
1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
</P>
<P>
"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering
money," she added, "and contributes greatly to the problem of
impunity in this country."
</P>
<P>
Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.
Players can bet on any combination of two-, three- or four-digit
numbers, the last two digits of which are associated with any one
of 25 animals, ranging from the alligator to the turkey. The
biggest payoff, $4,000 for a one-dollar bet, is awarded to those
who "hit the thousand," or correctly pick a winning four-digit
number.
</P>
<P>
"If I dream of a rooster, well then of course I'll bet on a
rooster," said Silvio Cunha, who works as a doorman at an
apartment building here. "When my mother comes to visit, I bet on
her flight number, and when I get my telephone bill I bet on that
number too. You need always to be alert to numbers that can bring
you luck."
</P>
<P>
The animal game was created in the 1890s by the owner of a zoo
here as a way to promote his venture. It became almost instantly
popular, which soon led the government, fearing that money would
be drained away from official lotteries, to ban it.
</P>
<P>
For decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the
game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent
campaigns to snuff it out. Finally, in 1946, the government
outlawed casinos and games of chance, the animal game among them.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless it survives. Today it is played everywhere in
Brazil, including remote corners of the Amazon, but continues to
be controlled from Rio by about a dozen bosses, called bicheiros.
</P>
<P>
Winning numbers are picked twice daily at a downtown building
that serves as the syndicate headquarters. The results are
immediately sent to the thousands of betting points across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian slang is peppered with references to the animal game.
Bicheiros recur as characters in Brazilian films, novels and
television programs, most recently on an HBO miniseries similar
to "The Sopranos."
</P>
<P>
Numerous sambas have been written about the game. In one of the
most famous, "I Hit the Thousand," a lucky bettor exults at
fulfilling the poor man's dream: "I won 500 smackers, and now I'm
not going to work anymore."
</P>
<P>
Though many Brazilians are reluctant to acknowledge it, bicheiros
also play a central, even essential, role in Carnival here. Not
only do they contribute the money that allows the samba "schools"
to parade with elaborate floats and costumes, but they sometimes
act as their "honorary presidents."
</P>
<P>
This year and last, directors of samba schools were killed
shortly before Carnival in what the authorities described as
murders related to disputes about control of the animal game.
</P>
<P>
Among those jailed in this most recent scandal was Ailton
Guimaraes, president of the league of samba schools, who is said
by authorities to be the animal game's boss of bosses.
</P>
<P>
Guimaraes, whose nickname is Captain -- his rank when he took
part in military operations against left-wing guerrilla groups in
the 1970s -- has declined several requests by The New York Times
for interviews in recent years.
</P>
<P>
But at a court hearing in April he said that he was active in the
animal game only between 1982 and 1993 and that he made his
living now as a "financial consultant," earning commissions of as
much as $200,000 a month from clients investing in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who brought an organizational sense and structure
to the game," said Frossard, the former judge, who has been the
target of assassination attempts that she attributes to hired
guns in the pay of game kingpins. "He also encouraged the group
to try to capture the state, at all three levels of government
and all three branches, instead of just paying off the police."
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand
their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines,
known here as "nickel hunters."
</P>
<P>
That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is
the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the
leftist Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
When the party governed Rio Grande do Sul, the home state of
Brazil's justice minister, animal game kingpins donated $500,000
for the purchase of the party headquarters there, a former party
official said at a parliamentary inquiry. At one point a tape was
played in which a party fundraiser could be heard urging the
chief of police to go easy on numbers runners.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, a videotape surfaced in which one of President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva's top political operatives was seen offering
to rewrite an online lottery contract to favor an animal game
boss nicknamed Charlie Waterfall. In return, the bicheiro
promised to contribute more than $100,000 to the Workers' Party
campaign and to pay a 1 percent commission to the official, who
had to resign as a result.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, da Silva, who had originally favored
legalizing the animal game, issued a temporary decree outlawing
bingo parlors. But the Senate refused to make the measure
permanent. Bicheiros and their associates have obtained judicial
rulings, many of them issued by judges later arrested, that have
blunted the effect of the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
Da Silva's chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, has now indicated that
the government is considering an about-face and is at least
willing to study the possibility of legalizing the animal game.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a simple question," she said recently, but "it's
obvious that as the investigations deepen, an institutional model
for the question of games of chance is going to be delineated in
Brazil."
</P>
<P>
Some Brazilians oppose legalization on moral grounds or because
they fear that it would attract foreign crime organizations.
Others are simply skeptical.
</P>
<P>
"I'd wager that legalization is never going to happen," Luiz
Carlos Menezes de Sa, a waiter, predicted after placing a 50-cent
bet on 3568, a number associated with the monkey.
</P>
<P>
"Without their bribes from the bicheiros, the politicians, cops
and judges wouldn't be able to live high on the hog the way they
do," he said. "Why would they want to do away with something that
makes so much money for them?"
