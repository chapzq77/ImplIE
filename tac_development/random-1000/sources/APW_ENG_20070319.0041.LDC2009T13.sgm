EU representatives to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Rice to
prepare for April summit

WASHINGTON 2007-03-19 00:16:04 UTC
</P>
<P>
Senior European Union representatives were to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday to prepare the ground
for an EU-U.S. summit on April 30 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country
holds the rotating presidency of the EU, along with EU foreign
policy chief Javier Solana and External Relations Commissioner
Benita Ferrero-Waldner were also expected to discuss issues
including the Middle East, Iran's nuclear program and the future
status of Kosovo with Rice.
</P>
<P>
The April summit is expected to consider a proposal by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel for a trade deal that would help
eliminate some regulatory barriers hindering companies in the
U.S. and EU from doing business with each other.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with Rice, the three European
representatives were to participate in a corporate forum on
energy technology research to be chaired by Rice and Steinmeier.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Steinmeier's departure from Germany on Sunday, the
German foreign minister suggested that the U.S. plan to build a
missile defense system in Europe-- an issue that has been a point
of contention -- has merits.
</P>
<P>
But in an opinion piece for the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung printed Sunday, Steinmeier said an open dialogue
was needed to address concerns from all sides.
</P>
<P>
"Given the strategic nature of such a project, I would advocate
proceeding carefully with intensive dialogue with all partners
involved, whether directly or indirectly," Steinmeier said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has vigorously opposed the idea for the missile program,
saying that placing systems in Poland and the Czech Republic
which are close to its border could diminish its nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. has tried to allay those concerns with assurances
that the deterrent was intended to counteract Iran's developing
missile program and the small number of installations would have
little effect on Russia's thousands of missiles, Moscow has
remained unconvinced and has suggested the deployment could lead
to a new arms race or rekindling of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Steinmeier had previously roiled U.S. officials by suggesting
that the United States should have included Russia in discussions
on the program. U.S. officials have responded that Russia had
been consulted repeatedly about the program.
