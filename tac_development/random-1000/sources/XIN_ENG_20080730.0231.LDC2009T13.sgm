NANJING, July 30 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Chinese star Yao Ming will not be the concern for the Australian
men's basketball team in Nanjing on Wednesday, the second day of
the FIBA Diamond Ball Tournament when it meets host China.
</P>
<P>
Brian Goorjian, the Austalian head coach, is putting the focus on
his own team rather than 2.26m NBA All-Star Yao and the Chinese
team. "We're focusing totally on us," Goorjian said before the
Boomers' first game at the tournament that serves as a warm-up
for the upcoming Beijing Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Yao poured in 21 points to lead his teammates in an 83-74 victory
over Angola on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're working on our sets and we're trying to get Andrew Bogut
and David Andersen comfortable in them and we'll make adjustments
on the game against China.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we'll try to double and rotate on Yao but, again, it
isn't a focus point for us.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get good at what we do - we want to press them,
we want to run and we want to look at our interior offense in the
half court that we've worked on for eight days."

</P>
<P>

81-71 in the opening game Tuesday with Houston Rockets forward
