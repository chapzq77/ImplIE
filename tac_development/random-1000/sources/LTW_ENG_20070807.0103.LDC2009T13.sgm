Question: Once in 2002, and again in 2006, I have had the wall-
to-wall carpeting in my co-op professionally cleaned. Now the
management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet
replaced because of a terrible odor. (By the way, I don't smell
anything.) The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid
over a concrete slab and that's the problem. He says the carpet
has retained moisture and is moldy. So I am wondering, if they
put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being
retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years? What
else can be done?
</P>

Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture
content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your
concrete floor is emitting moisture. There are two popular tests
to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet
to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space
after 24 hours. The other involves using calcium chloride, and
the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72
hours.
</P>
<P>
Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of
water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet
of floor in a 24-hour period. Generally, the acceptable level is
4.5 pounds or less.
</P>
<P>
Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these
devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in
concrete. They are not considered totally accurate because they
measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give
readings only at the surface.
</P>
<P>
I think you have a legitimate concern, and I would advise against
installing new carpeting in your co-op. You are right, in my
opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty
smelling again.
</P>
<P>
Now, what are your options? Well, let's assume your building is
older and that the concrete has been in place for some time. If
that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because
the concrete is curing. I would suggest installing a tile floor,
which will allow some moisture from the slab to rise through into
the living space. To deal with the moisture from the slab, use
one or two dehumidifiers.
</P>
<P>
To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs,
which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.

If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed
a second time.

Q.: I've lived in my home for 48 years. Seven years ago, I had a
blacktop driveway installed. Since then, I've had several people
tell me I need to have the driveway sealed. Some people tell me
it needs to be done annually. What's the truth?
</P>
<P>
A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings
Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make
is sealing asphalt driveways every year. ``That's too much,'' he
said. ``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is
to look for the white stones in the asphalt. When you can see the
white stones, then it's time.'' Generally, Kellerman said, it's
about every four or five years, not every year or two. Hope that
helps.

Q. I have a problem with clover. How can I get rid of it? Also
what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
</P>
<P>
A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has
a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists
think it makes lawns more attractive. I tend to have a lot of
clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet
and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
</P>
<P>
That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming
back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the
spring. This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover
naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its
dormancy before the clover. I'm told by organic experts that,
depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant
after a season or two.
</P>

As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum
flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic
alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin. Ants don't
like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the
dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks
of concrete and asphalt. You'll likely have to repeat the
procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks,
silverfish, flies and spiders. I'm told it can be dusted on
animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check
with your vet before applying to any household pets.
