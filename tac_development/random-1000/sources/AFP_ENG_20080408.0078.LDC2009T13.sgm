The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 35.99 points (0.29

</P>
<P>
Such a downturn would be defined as a recession by most
economists.
</P>
<P>
The minutes from a March 18 policy meeting, at which Fed
policymakers slashed US short-term interest rates by three
quarters of a percentage point to 2.25 percent, paint a bleaker
picture of the US economy.

The economy is being buffeted by a persistent housing slump,
credit woes, rocketing oil prices and rising job losses.

to the prime residential and commercial real estate markets,
consumer credit, and the low- to high grade corporate credit
markets," the IMF said in releasing its Global Financial

Subprime home loans, or mortgages given to people with scant
