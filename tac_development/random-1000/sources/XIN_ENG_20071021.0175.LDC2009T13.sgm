BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Major global news media have continued to give prominence to the
17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
which closed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Jiji News Agency and Kyodo News Service said China has
shown its concerns about peoples lives by incorporating the
"scientific outlook on development" into the party's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Jiji said the amendment of the party's constitution showed China
is going to adjust its economic-growth-orientated policy, focus
on building a harmonious society, pursue a sustainable and stable
economic growth, narrow the gap between the rich and poor, better
protect the environment and make its people more affluent.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said raising the ratio in competitive elections to over
eight percent in the preliminary election of the Central
Committee has shown democracy within the party.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said in a report that the
resolution adopted by the congress on the amendment to the CPC
constitution to enshrine the "scientific outlook on development"
was a milestone in the party's history and meant the focus of
China's economic growth would shift from being growth- oriented
to the realization of stability and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The "scientific outlook on development" values rational thinking.
At it's core is putting people first and a basic requirement is
balanced and sustainable development, the Yonhap report said.
</P>
<P>
This outlook aims to serve the people, to work for their well-
being, and calls for development that benefits the people and is
based on the notion that the fruits of growth should be shared by
all, Yonhap said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook would be combined with the theory of building a
harmonious society, which strives to solve problems such as the
urban-rural gap, the rich-poor gap and unbalanced development and
gives priority to environmental protection, Yonhap said.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP)
ran updated stories on the election of the new Central Committee
and the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the
CPC, as well as the conclusion of the congress.
</P>
<P>
The AP said the result will determine how strong the leadership
is "as it tries to ease tensions over a wide rich-poor gap at
home and manage China's rising clout abroad."
</P>
<P>
The AP also reported that a revision to the party's constitution
endorses "the scientific outlook on development," calling for
increased social spending to help farmers and urban workers whose
living standards have not risen as fast as many other Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Reuters said that the "scientific outlook of development" aims to
"divert more prosperity to backward villages and poor workers"
and to clean up fouled skies and waterways.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) also reported on the conclusion
of the Congress and the insertion of the Scientific Outlook on
Development into the party constitution.
</P>
<P>
The report cited General Secretary Hu Jintao as saying: "The
scientific outlook on development takes development as its
essence, putting people first as its core, and comprehensive,
balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement."
</P>
<P>
The scientific outlook on development requires China to move
towards more sustainable growth and create a "harmonious society"
by reducing the economic inequalities that have resulted from the
economic developments, the DPA report said.
</P>
<P>
The China Press newspaper, published in the United States,
covered at length the closing of the 17th CPC National Congress.
An editorial of the paper said people's livelihood has become
"the core of China's future development."
</P>
<P>
In Hu's report, China's economic growth was for the first time
expressed in per capita terms rather than overall economic
growth. This was a sign that the focus of economic growth is not
only on strengthening the economy, but more importantly on
enriching the whole population and that any development must
benefit the general public.
</P>
<P>
"This is a strategic shift in China's outlook on development,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Other international media such as the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), the Australian Associated Press and electronic
and web news media of Singapore also issued reports on the
closing of the CPC National Congress.
