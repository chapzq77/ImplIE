Al-Sadr Re-Emerges, Stakes Leadership Claim
</HEADLINE>

<P>
KUFA, Iraq
</P>
<P>
The dramatic resurfacing Friday of powerful cleric Muqtada al-
Sadr appeared carefully staged to counter claims that his hold
over Shiite Muslims is weakening and to reassert his position as
political kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this
Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the
champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed. He also
instructed his militia to refrain from confrontations with Iraqi
security forces, saying they should ``resort to civilian means
when they are attacked.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Baghdad seemed surprised by al-Sadr's return,
which comes at a key juncture in Iraq. Officials in Iraq and
Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
</P>
<P>
``We hope that he would take the opportunity to play a productive
role,'' said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Members of al-Sadr's al-Mahdi militia staged two major uprisings
against U.S. forces in 2004. But this year, the 33-year-old
cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in
Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull
back.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is
mounting with the fractured government; a 3-month-old security
plan has made few inroads against withering violence; and
speculation is rife about how much longer U.S.-led forces will
remain actively engaged. Talks scheduled for next week between
U.S. and Iranian representatives add another element of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Sensing the weakness of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Iraqi
leaders have been positioning themselves for his possible fall.
Al-Sadr's return could signal a ``gathering of forces'' in
anticipation of major changes in the Iraqi government, said Vali
Nasr, an expert on Shiite politics at the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for
what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said. ``And Sadr is probably the
biggest player in that because he has a large chunk of the vote,
and he controls the street.''
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power
last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a
key point. Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from
the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head
of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that
dominates parliament.
</P>
<P>
Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet
in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a
U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the
governing Shiite bloc.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his
national image. Last year, his followers were widely blamed for
driving the sectarian killing that drove up the toll of Iraq's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of
his followers who refused to rein in their activities. Earlier
this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed
Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who
have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence,
might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus
could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians
such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense
Department official and military expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a
better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salah Ubaisi, one of al-Sadr's close aides, said the
cleric was trying to find a way to move the country forward.
``Iraq is now facing a severe crisis in all aspects, politically,
economically and security wise,'' he said. ``We as a political
movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that al-Sadr fled to Iran ahead of the
U.S. troop buildup that began Feb. 13. Most of the cleric's
followers insist he never left Iraq, though one official in his
movement said Friday that the cleric had used the time out of the
public eye to conduct a ``regional tour,'' which included a stop
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the
western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for
the first time in more than four months. An emotional crowd
surged forward and showered him with candies.
</P>
<P>
He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on
which he has built his nationalist credentials. He asked his
followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice. No to Israel.
No to America. No to the devils.''
</P>
<P>
``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or
schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his
traditional black robes and turban. ``The government should not
allow the occupiers to extend their stay in Iraq, not even for
one more day.''
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadr said he stood ready to defend Sunnis and Christians who
have been targeted by extremists, even as he underlined his
displeasure with proposals to re-integrate members of Saddam
Hussein's Sunni Arab regime into the government and civil service
-- one of the benchmarks for continued U.S. support.
