Congestion Pricing: Transportation Department's Plan to Cut
Flight Delays Is a Short-Term Fix
</HEADLINE>

The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:

The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing
at the nation's busiest airports. After a year of horrible travel
delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to
bring order to crowded airports. The plan would allow congested
airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak
travel times. But this short-term fix is not enough. Upgrading
the air traffic control system is the real solution to America's
air-travel woes.
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York. In announcing the policy, the
Transportation Department noted that the number of arrival delays
exceeding one hour there increased by 114 percent in the first 10
months of fiscal 2007. It also pointed out something that air
travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at
New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the
air-travel delays throughout the nation.

The department's objectives are twofold. The new pricing scheme
would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with
flights in certain parts of the day. The result could be a more
even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day,
and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized
airports. The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use
planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of
smaller, regional jets.

The incentive for airport operators is that they can factor into
their fees the reasonable costs associated with runway and other
facility improvements that would ultimately aid in reducing
delays. Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules,
which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no
significant changes are required.
</P>
<P>
In slamming the department's proposal, Air Transport Association
President James C. May made the good point that the plan "does
nothing to fix the primary cause of delays: our nation's
increasingly antiquated air traffic control system." The Federal
Aviation Administration has been waiting for nearly a year for
Congress to fund a state-of-the-art satellite navigation system
that would allow pilots and controllers to use air space more
efficiently. A dogfight among the various interests over how to
pay for it is bogging things down. It's time Congress resolved
it.
