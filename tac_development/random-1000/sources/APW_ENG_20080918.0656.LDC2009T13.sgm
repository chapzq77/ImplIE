Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has lashed out again at
Israel, saying that the Jewish state won't survive in any form.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the hard-line leader smirked
at a former mantra of the Israeli right of a "Greater" Israel
that would include occupied Palestinian territories. The idea has
since been abandoned, with Israeli consensus now that there will
be a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad said that while "some say the idea of Greater Israel
has expired, I say the idea of a Lesser Israel has expired, too."
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad also repeated previous anti-Israel comments, calling
the Holocaust by Nazi Germany a "fake" and saying Israel is
perpetrating a holocaust on the Palestinian people.
