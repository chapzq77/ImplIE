KURDS ASSERT CONTROL OVER KIRKUK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIRKUK, Iraq
</P>
<P>
The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security
commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply
divided city.
</P>
<P>
On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether
it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left
its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
No, Najat told the caller. But after hanging up, he wryly
revealed the deeper truth about Kirkuk, combustible for its mix
of ethnicities floating together on a sea of oil: The Kurds
already control it.
</P>
<P>
"It's true," Najat said. "What is the need for the troops?"
</P>
<P>
Of all the political problems facing Iraq today, perhaps none is
so intractable as the fate of Kirkuk, a city of 900,000 that
Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens all claim as their own. The explosive
quarrel over the city is one major barrier to creating stable
political structures in the rest of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, it demonstrates that despite a recent decline in
violence, Iraq's unsettled ethnic and regional discord could
still upend directives emanating from Baghdad and destabilize
large regions of the country -- or even set off a civil war.
</P>
<P>
This month, legislation in the national parliament to set the
groundwork for crucial provincial elections collapsed in a bitter
dispute over Kirkuk, as Arabs and Turkmens demanded that the
Kurds be forced to cede some of their power here. But with the
Kurds having already consolidated their authority in Kirkuk,
there seemed little chance -- short of a military intervention --
of that happening.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city. In addition
to the provincial government and command of the police, the Kurds
control the Asaish, the feared undercover security service that
works with the U.S. military and, according to Asaish commanders,
U.S. intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack
and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the
best intelligence. The leaders of the Asaish report only to the
dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
"He's my boss," said Najat, the commander of the KDP Asaish force
in Kirkuk, glancing at a picture of Masrur Barzani, the head of
intelligence for the KDP and the son of the party's leader,
Massoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability
to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago,
rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish
demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds
wounded.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, a mob of Kurds set upon a Turkmen political
headquarters, eventually firebombing the building. At some point,
the Turkmen guards inside fired at the crowd. All in all, U.S.
officials say they believe, far more people were killed and
wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
</P>
<P>
Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the
headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did
not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building. One of
the Turkmen guards wounded in the fighting was quickly
interrogated at the hospital by the Asaish and the police. A
video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the
crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish police commanders promise an impartial investigation of
the bombing and its aftermath, overseen by officers from all of
the city's ethnic groups. But the senior Turkmen on the force,
Maj. Gen. Turhan Abdul-Rahman Youssef, fears a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will have a result," he said, describing the
broadcast showing the wounded Turkmen guard as "illegal."
</P>
<P>
The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs
and Turkmens. "There is much fear," said Mohammed Khalil, the
leader of the Arab bloc on the provincial council. "The Asaish
are saying they will annex Kirkuk by force, and that is
terrifying people." Arabs also say the Asaish carry out
kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
</P>
<P>
But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the
security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an
outbreak of ethnic fighting. The city's Arabs, said Khalil, "will
not stay handcuffed by Kurdish actions."
</P>
<P>
Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Kurdish families were
driven out of Kirkuk, replaced by Arabs as part of his drive to
obtain a firmer political grip on the enormous oil reserves here.
But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish
militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing
in Kurds. Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of
Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan
region. They also warn that any plan involuntarily stripping them
of power will be harshly contested.
</P>
<P>
"Its fate will be failure," said Nejad Hassan, the senior KDP
official in Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
After the suicide bombing, that conflict was evident in a dispute
about whether to bring a substantial number of Iraqi troops into
the city, in a direct challenge to Kurdish supremacy.
</P>
<P>
In a series of sweeps conducted with the Americans, the Iraqi
army has helped establish stability this year in other volatile
parts of Iraq. But Iraqi troops have largely stayed out of
Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
After the July 28 attacks, however, Prime Minister Nouri Kamal
al-Maliki ordered in a battalion from a nearby base. The troops
took up positions in the city.
</P>
<P>
Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to
send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to
administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force,
loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled
forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
</P>
<P>
Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major
Arab security force after the July 28 violence. The U.S. military
commander here, Col. David Paschal, said he feared that if
Baghdad sent in additional troops, Kurdish leaders would
retaliate by sending in their own militia from northern Iraq,
creating a potentially disastrous confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"I just saw this continued escalation of force happening," he
said. Baghdad is expected to withdraw the troops, according to
U.S. commanders.
</P>
<P>
Paschal said he blames all the political parties for inflaming
tensions to serve their interests. But he said it was difficult
to comprehend the level of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations here are, 'You give me everything I want, and I
will walk away happy,"' he said. "It is hard for us to appreciate
the level of ethnic hatred."
</P>
<P>
The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three
weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to
protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic,
a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be
seen standing in a sea of demonstrators. He ritualistically
raises his hands, palms up, toward his face, then lowers them to
his side. An instant later the explosion engulfs him and everyone
around him.
</P>
<P>
It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their
fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed. One mistook a
well-known Kurdish journalist, Yahya Barzanji, for a Turkmen
correspondent, shouting, "He's working for the Turkmens,"
Barzanji recalled. A video captured the crowd furiously beating
Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him! Kill him!"
</P>
<P>
Within minutes the mob was in front of the Turkmen party
headquarters. While U.S. and Kurdish officials agree that the
Turkmen guards fired into the crowd, Paschal -- who watched the
skirmish unfold in a video feed from a remotely piloted aerial
drone -- said that the Turkmens did not appear to fire wantonly,
and that they instead gradually escalated until they were firing
directly into a large and growing mob that posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the
suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish
commander at the main hospital. Kurdish authorities have sought
to play down the intensity of the fight between the Kurds and the
Turkmens, but Paschal said most of the casualties were sustained
during the riot.
</P>
<P>
Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since
last summer. Kurds attribute some of that improvement to the
Asaish.
</P>
<P>
"They are in direct contact with the people," said Hemin Shafiq,
a 24-year-old policeman. "They are more rapid. That is why they
are much more active than the police."
</P>
<P>
Rifat Abdullah, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
here, said: "The Asaish have lots of sources, and that's why the
Americans depend on them and the police depend on them. That
might explain why they have more power."
</P>
<P>
Turhan admitted that the Asaish officers were, at times, more
powerful than the police, and he said there were thousands of
Asaish in the city, though Kurdish officials say there are no
more than 1,000. "They have a major role combating terrorism, but
the problem is they are loyal to the political parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the provincial police chief, Maj. Gen. Jamal
Taher, a Kurd, did not answer a question about whether he had the
power to control the activities of the Asaish. But he praised
their ability to ferret out information.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they have better sources than me," he said.
