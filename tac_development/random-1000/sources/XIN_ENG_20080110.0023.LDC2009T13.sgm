SHENZHEN, Jan. 10 (Xinhua)

<P>
Three people remained hospitalized on Thursday in Shenzhen
following a mass food poisoning that befell more than 300 factory
workers on Wednesday in the southern Chinese boom city.

A manager of the Hong Kong-invested company that produced
hardware and plastic in the outer Longgang District in the
Guangdong Province city, said the workers suffered headaches,
nausea and vomiting after eating Chinese cabbage and kidney beans
for lunch in the staff canteen. They were sent to five local
hospitals for treatment.

<P>
A health department spokesman said most of the patients were
allowed to go home after treatment, but 36 of the cases were
serious. Five people had to spend the night in hospital.
</P>
<P>
He said three patients were still under treatment and observation
on Thursday.

<P>
Investigators suspected undercooked kidney beans as the cause of
the illness.

Experts said kidney beans contained lectin, a toxic agent that
could cause diarrhea if the beans weren't heated thoroughly.

Undercooked kidney beans had hospitalized 248 teenage students in
the southwest Yunnan Province last month.
