Iran's Ahmadinejad defiant... over his culinary skills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Better known for his defiance on Iran's nuclear programme,
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Tuesday revealed he was a handy
cook who prepares "delicious" food and regrets not spending more
time at home.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview aimed at showing his personal side,
Ahmadinejad made no mention of Iran's disputes with the West and
instead portrayed himself as a hardworking husband who only
leaves his job in the small hours.
</P>
<P>
"Before (I became president) I used to do the grocery shopping.
Now sometimes I help in the kitchen and I know how to make all
the Iranian food," Ahmadinejad said.
</P>
<P>
Pressed by the interviewer for more details, Ahmadinejad
continued in typically defiant fashion.
</P>
<P>
"Of course what I make is delicious -- ask everyone who has eaten
it! I can make all the different kinds of soups and Iranian
stews," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad, who has long boasted of his ability to work hard,
said he is often at his desk by 5:30 am and sometimes does not
leave until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
"I used to visit my relatives more but now I do so less. I see
them when they are all in one place, but I regularly visit my
mother and when I visit her the rest come to see me."
</P>
<P>
While sparking international controversy for comments predicting
that Israel is doomed to disappear, Ahmadinejad has also sought
to cultivate an image as a simple peace-loving man who offers
friendship to everyone.
</P>
<P>
But like almost all Iranian politicians, Ahmadinejad's private
life remains a closely guarded secret, and his wife, two sons and
daughter are rarely seen in public.
