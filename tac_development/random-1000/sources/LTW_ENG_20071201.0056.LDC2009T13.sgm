A leader for Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

The bewildering crisis in Lebanon has taken another perplexing
twist with reports that the gridlocked parliament has agreed to
choose the country's top general, Michel Suleiman, as its next
president. The question is whether Suleiman represents a genuine
compromise among Lebanon's intractable factions or whether his
ascension would signal a  betrayal of the 2005 "Cedar
Revolution," which ended in the promise to kick Syria out of
Lebanese politics and give real democracy a chance.

The presidential selection process has been anything but free or
fair. Under Lebanon's tortured constitution, parliament chooses
the president. But the power balance in parliament isn't based on
election results; rather, it tracks the tally of assassinations.
After four anti-Syrian lawmakers were murdered, their colleagues
have been holed up since  September in the Phoenicia Hotel   in
Beirut, trying to hang on to their slim parliamentary majority by
the simple expedient of staying alive. President Emile Lahoud's
term expired last week, and Lahoud left office with no successor
in sight. The vote to replace him has been delayed six times and
is now scheduled for Dec. 6.

The United States and France have supported the pro-democracy
movement that drew more than a million people into the streets in
the  Cedar Revolution  that succeeded in driving Syria   from
Lebanon in 2005. But the West has not done enough since then to
keep Syria or Hezbollah from paralyzing political progress.
Hezbollah's punishing war with Israel, its rapid rearmament and
its successful intimidation of  parliament have proceeded apace,
while the United Nations tribunal charged with investigating the
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has
dragged. Now Beirut's beleaguered moderates fear that the West is
once again willing to turn a blind eye to Syrian meddling in
Lebanon if Damascus will participate in  Israeli-Palestinian
peace negotiations. Peace in the Golan Heights would be a prize,
but giving radical Islamists veto power over the Lebanese
government would be a tragic price to pay in return.

Enter Suleiman, who is no white knight  but who might be able to
keep Lebanon from a new civil war. Originally handpicked by the
Syrians, Suleiman refused to use the army to crush pro-democracy
demonstrators. He became a national hero for routing a radical
faction that had seized control of a Palestinian refugee camp.
Yet he enjoys close ties to Hezbollah and, as army chief, has
allowed the smuggling of weapons from Syria to the Islamist
fighters. In truth, a leader opposed by Hezbollah cannot control
Lebanon today or prevent renewed civil strife, and the West will
probably recognize Suleiman. But it should not allow Lebanon to
again become ground zero in a proxy war sponsored by Syria and
Iran.
