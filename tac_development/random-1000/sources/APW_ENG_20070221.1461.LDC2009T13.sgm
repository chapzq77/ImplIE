Africa tops Mideast as U.S. crude source, helped by market
changes

<P>
When it comes to supplying the United States with oil, Africa is
quietly trumping the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude oil imports from Africa topped supplies from the
Middle East in 2006 for the first time in 21 years, recent
government data show. As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the
Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent,
or 1.3 million barrels a day. Now, the fractional edge given to
African crude oil suppliers underscores a number of market
changes and may grow wider in coming years.
</P>
<P>
Surging growth from Asia -- led by China, where oil demand is
expected to grow 6.2 percent this year -- is drawing huge volumes
of Middle East crude. In the U.S. market, output constraints from
aging oil fields in Mexico and Venezuela are weighing on imports
from those countries.
</P>
<P>
Crude supplies from Africa and the Middle East each accounted for
a 22 percent share of U.S. crude imports, but in actual physical
supplies, Africa's flow topped the Middle East by 8,000 barrels a
day.
</P>
<P>
Crude from Africa, at 2.23 million barrels a day, was the highest
since 1979 and a 4.8 percent jump from 2005. The 22 percent share
-- the biggest in 25 years -- compares with 21 percent last year
and a share of less than 13 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The volume of U.S. crude imports from the Middle East, at 2.22
million barrels a day, dipped just 20,000 barrels a day on the
year, but marks the third straight annual decline. The flow of
Middle East crude into the United States was at the lowest level
since 1998 and the 22 percent share is the slimmest since 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Strong demand growth in Asia is pulling Persian Gulf crude
eastward and the new supply from Africa is staying in the
Atlantic Basin," said Greg Priddy, global energy analyst at the
Eurasia Group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Major producers such as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil
exporter -- and other Middle East producers have targeted more
volumes to China and India, where they've also built joint
ventures to sell petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia saw its third straight decline in crude supply to
the U.S. market, with a 1.7 percent dip to 1.42 million barrels a
day, the lowest volume since 1999.
</P>
<P>
Supplies from other traditional top suppliers Mexico and
Venezuela are raising concern, due to declines in output. U.S.
crude imports from output-constrained Caracas slumped 8.2
percent. While Venezuela held its fourth-place ranking among U.S.
crude suppliers, the volume of 1.139 million barrels a day was
the lowest in any year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Oil producers in Africa have picked up the slack. U.S. crude
imports from Angola surged 41 percent in December from a year
earlier, capping a 12.5 percent full-year gain to a record
average of 513,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude imports from Algeria jumped 57 percent to 357,000
barrels a day in 2006, the highest volume since 1980.
</P>
<P>
For the second straight year, crude imports from Chad rose by
nearly 30 percent, reaching a high of 95,000 barrels a day in
2006.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. imports from Nigeria -- Africa's biggest oil
producer -- dropped 3.2 percent on the year to 1.043 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since 2003 as civil unrest in the
oil-producing Delta region disrupted supplies throughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
Canada remains the top U.S. crude supplier, a title it has held
each year since 2004, when it eclipsed Saudi Arabia. In 2006,
Canada supplied 1.782 million barrels a day to the United States,
the most ever from a single source and a 9.1 percent jump from a
year ago.
