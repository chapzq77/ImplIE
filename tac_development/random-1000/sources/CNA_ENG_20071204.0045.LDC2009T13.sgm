Two German academics have won the 2007 Tsungming Tu Award
instituted by the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) to
honor outstanding foreign scientists, an NSC official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NSC Chairman Chen Chien-jen presented the awards to the two
Germans  --  Peter Jonas,  a  physiology  professor  at  the
Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg and Klaus H. Ploog, a
former director of the Graduate Institute of Solid State
Electronics of the Max Planck Society -- in a ceremony held in
Taipei earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Each recipient was awarded US$75,000 in cash plus a trophy and a
citation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Chen said the award is the highest
academic  honor bestowed upon foreign scholars  by the Taiwan
government.
</P>
<P>
The Tsungming Tu Award was set up last year by the NSC, which
then signed the "Tsungming Tu -- Humboldt Research Award
Agreement" with Germany's Alexander von Humboldt (AvH) Foundation
to commend outstanding academics and experts from both countries.
</P>
<P>
After the two winners of the first Tsungming Tu Award were
commended, Lee Der- tsai, director of the Institute of
Information Science of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious
academic institution, was selected as the winner of the Humboldt
Research Award and will go to the German city of Bonn next April
for the presentation.
</P>
<P>
Besides working with the AvH, the NSC is also planning to
approach academic institutes in Canada, the U.K. and Japan for
possible future cooperation in a similar vein.
