Emre Belezoglu scored on a second-half penalty Wednesday to help
Turkey earn a 1-1 draw against Belgium in a World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
FC Brugge's Wesley Sonck had given the visitors the lead in the
31st minute, heading a free kick past Turkey goalkeeper Volkan
Demirel into the top right corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
That goal was a wake-up call for Turkey, and the European
Championship semifinalists went on the attack for the rest of the
first half, forcing several good saves from Belgium goalkeeper
Stijn Stijnen.
</P>
<P>
Turkey kept pressing relentlessly in the second half and the
equalizer finally came in the 73rd minute, when Emre easily
converted a penalty into the bottom right corner after a
handball.
</P>
<P>
Both teams have four points after two games. Armenia, Estonia,
Spain and Bosnia-Herzegovina are also in group 5.
