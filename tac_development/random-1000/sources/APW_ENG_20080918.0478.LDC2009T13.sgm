Sri Lanka orders Tamils in Colombo to register

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 2008-09-18 10:29:21 UTC

<P>
Sri Lankan authorities on Thursday ordered tens of thousands of
ethnic Tamils living in Colombo to register with police a day
after fierce fighting in the country's civil war killed 71
fighters, the military said.
</P>
<P>
The military also announced that naval forces destroyed a rebel
boat off the coast during a sea battle Thursday, while
downplaying reports that the rebels had attacked advancing troops
with a chemical weapon.
</P>
<P>
As the fighting intensified in recent months, the rebels have
been blamed for a series of deadly attacks on buses, trains and
other targets in the capital of Colombo and other towns that have
killed scores of civilians far from the war zone.
</P>
<P>
Authorities established a maze of roadblocks and checkpoints and
continuously changed traffic patterns in Colombo in an effort to
prevent new attacks. They have also required all residents of the
north to register with the police upon their arrival in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera announced Thursday that every
Sri Lankan who came to Colombo from the north in the past five
years would have to reregister with police en masse Sunday at
police stations and other designated centers across the city.
</P>
<P>
The order will affect more than 100,000 people who came from the
districts of Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar and
Mullaittivu, he said. The overwhelming majority of those people
are ethnic Tamils.
</P>
<P>
"We will not harass people, but we will request, 'Please come,'"
Gunasekera said, adding that the exercise was simply an effort by
authorities to update their records. He did not say what would
happen to those who fail to register.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Tamils living in the capital have complained of frequent
police raids, harassment and arbitrary detentions as the fighting
between government forces, dominated by the Sinhalese majority,
and the Tamil Tigers escalated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Authorities, who hold wide-ranging security powers under
emergency regulations renewed by Parliament each month, have long
accused rebel sleeper agents of hiding amid Colombo's Tamil
community.
</P>
<P>
Mano Ganesan, a Tamil lawmaker from Colombo, said there would not
be enough time to register everyone in one day and few will be
able to produce the required documents from government agents in
their faraway home districts.
</P>
<P>
Those unable to register will likely be expelled from the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow it. We will fight against it, but that is
their plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In new fighting Wednesday, soldiers killed 15 guerrillas in
scattered battles in the Vavuniya district bordering the rebels'
de facto state, the military said Thursday. Other battles along
the front lines killed five rebels and seven soldiers, the
military said. The government previously reported 40 rebels and
four soldiers killed in other fighting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Much of the communication to northern Sri Lanka has been cut, and
it was not possible to contact rebel officials for comment. The
military's figures could not be independently confirmed. Each
side commonly exaggerates its enemy's casualties and plays down
its own.
</P>
<P>
With the Tamil Tigers growing increasingly desperate in the face
of a new government offensive, military officials said Thursday
that some rebel fighters had attacked troops with CS gas, a form
of tear gas. Military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said six
troops were hit and hospitalized with minor breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
However, a Special Forces soldier in the northern war zone told
The Associated Press on Wednesday that a group of soldiers was
killed by what appeared to be a burn agent loaded into a
shoulder-fired rocket during a battle in the Kilinochchi district
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, who refused to be identified because he was not
authorized to speak to the media, said he had seen the bodies,
and many were so badly disfigured they had to be buried in
closed-caskets funerals.
</P>
<P>
Nanayakkara denied the account, saying that rebels had
experimented with using chemical weapons, but had never employed
them in battle.
</P>
<P>
"There was no burn agent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for
Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese
majority. The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people.
