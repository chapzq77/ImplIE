McCain Moves to Soften the Tone at Rallies, if Not in Ads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of perhaps the most charged and negative week of the
presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain sought to tone down his
rhetoric toward Sen. Barack Obama even as his running mate,
allies and his own advertising continued to attack the character
of the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town
hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his
rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences
with Obama.
</P>
<P>
The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when
he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father
that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We want to fight and I want to fight, but we will be
respectful," McCain said, again prompting loud boos when he
declared that he admires Obama's accomplishments. "I want
everyone to be respectful, and let's be sure we are. ... That
doesn't mean you have to reduce your ferocity. It's just got to
be respectful."
</P>
<P>
At one point in the event, McCain grabbed back the microphone
from an elderly woman who had begun to say that she didn't like
Obama because he is an Arab. "No, ma'am. No, ma'am," McCain said.
"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have
serious differences with on fundamental questions."
</P>
<P>
His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally
shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists
angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was
mentioned. Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped
their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
</P>
<P>
McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he
respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I
didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I
wouldn't be running."
</P>
<P>
But throughout the day, McCain's allies and advertising unleashed
a flurry of attacks on his rival's ethics, touting Obama's ties
to a Vietnam War-era radical and accusing him of being connected
to a group accused of engaging in voter fraud.
</P>
<P>
He launched a tough new television ad linking Obama to William
Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which bombed U.S.
facilities in protest of the Vietnam War. The narrator in the ad
says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses
the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
</P>
<P>
Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John
Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which
Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of
that relationship."
</P>
<P>
At the town hall, McCain promised not to relent on tying Obama to
Ayers, telling the crowd, "We'll be talking about that more."
</P>
<P>
Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd
by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning
will backfire. "They can run misleading ads. They can pursue the
politics of anything goes. It will not work. Not this time,"
Obama said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates
offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock
market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses,
a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and
complement what has already been done for major financial
institutions. McCain said the federal government should suspend
rules that require seniors to begin withdrawing from their
retirement accounts when they reach age 70 1/2 to allow them more
times to try and recoup recent losses.
</P>
<P>
But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on
Obama's character.
</P>
<P>
The accusation about voter fraud came in a conference call with
his campaign manager, Rick Davis, who said he is worried the
election is being "stolen" in several battleground states where
irregularities have been alleged in voter registrations collected
by ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform
Now.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the election is something that should be stolen
from the American electorate," Davis said, urging Obama to join
him in calling for federal investigations and media inquiries
into ACORN and its ties to Obama.
</P>
<P>
"ACORN is an organization that has violated the law on a repeated
basis," Davis said. "Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the
last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
</P>
<P>
The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad,
in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks,
intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business." It says ACORN
stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to
ACORN run long and deep. ... They even endorsed him for
president."
</P>
<P>
Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an
ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a
lawyer. They said his work as an organizer in 1992 was not
connected to the group.
</P>
<P>
"The McCain campaign's allegations about Senator Obama are
completely transparent and false," spokesman Tommy Vietor said.
Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels
is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false
claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful
attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented
challenges facing their families and our nation."
</P>
<P>
The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny
since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Agents with the Nevada secretary of state and attorney general's
office raided the group's Clark County headquarters, alleging
that ACORN had hired felons to collect signatures and had
submitted about 300 apparently fraudulent registration cards.
</P>
<P>
Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying
they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter
registration forms that they collect. But, in many states the law
requires them to submit forms to election officials even if they
contain suspect information.
</P>
<P>
"We feel the current strategy from the right is to create and
manufacture a so-called crisis of voter fraud," said Brian
Kettenring, chief organizer for ACORN in Florida.
