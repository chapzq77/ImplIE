Giant sinkhole in Guatemala swallows several homes, at least 2
dead

GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala 2007-02-24 01:02:38 UTC
</P>
<P>
A 100-meter-deep (330-foot-deep) sinkhole killed two teenage
siblings and swallowed about a dozen homes, forcing the
evacuation of nearly 1,000 people in a crowded Guatemala City
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed recent rains and an underground sewage flow from
a ruptured main for opening up the sinkhole on Friday, and warned
that it could widen. The two bodies were found near the enormous
fissure, floating in a river of sewage.
</P>
<P>
The pit emitted foul odors, loud noises and tremors, shaking the
surrounding ground. A rush of water could be heard from its
depths, and authorities feared it could widen or others could
open up.
</P>
<P>
"We have closed the valves on the storm and sewer drains and we
are going to wait until the area stabilizes before going down
there to evaluate, but in the meantime the mouth of the hole will
certainly become larger," said Alvaro Rodas, the director of
social development for Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Edward Ramirez, 26, said he and other residents had been hearing
noises and feeling tremors for about a month before the sinkhole
appeared before dawn, waking many in the poor neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"People were shouting 'The electric posts are falling down!'"
said Ramirez, who lives 50 meters (50 yards) from the hole. "We
are going to a friend's house now. There's no way we'll stay
here."
</P>
<P>
Emergency spokesman Juan Carlos Bolanos identified the dead teens
as Irma and David Soyos. Their father, Domingo, was still
missing, according to national disaster coordinator Hugo
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Residents said others were unaccounted for, but Hernandez could
not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
Authorities evacuated nearby homes and cordoned off a 500-meter
(500-yard) perimeter around the crater.
</P>
<P>
Police helped residents move out, with some officers carrying
refrigerators and televisions on their shoulders while other
pushed sofas on makeshift carts.
</P>
<P>
Security officials were on guard for possible looters and to
clear the area of onlookers.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had apparently suspected something was wrong with the
site before the sinkhole appeared. "We knew, and (the seismology
institute) had placed a seismic meter there," Rodas said. "The
city government had contracted a robotic camera system to go down
there, but the disaster occurred first."
</P>
<P>
Cristobal Colon, a spokesman for the municipal water authority,
said the sewage main ruptured after becoming clogged. He said the
army had been considering a controlled explosion to clear the
pipe, which carries both rainwater and sewage for much of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Fuentes, 50, said he plans to abandon the run-down
neighborhood he has called home for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Last night a friend had to take my handicapped wife out on
motorcycle," he said. "Now I'm leaving for good, never to come
back."
