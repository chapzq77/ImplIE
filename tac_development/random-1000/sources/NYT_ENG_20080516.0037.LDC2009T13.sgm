FACED WITH ELIMINATION, FLYERS AND THEIR FANS SHOW SOME LIFE

PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
His white helmet knocked askew, Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney
Crosby slowly skidded on his back toward the Philadelphia Flyers'
goal, picking up snow on the seat of his pants. He, and his team,
did not look so invincible Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Facing elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers
rediscovered the ferocity they had displayed in the first two
rounds, scoring three first-period goals and then holding off
Pittsburgh, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 19,972 at Wachovia
Center.
</P>
<P>
"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the
difference," Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
After scoring one goal on nine power-play chances in the first
three games of the series, all won by the Penguins, Philadelphia
scored two power-play goals and avoided being swept from the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Game 5 is scheduled for Sunday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia goaltender Martin Biron stopped 36 of 38 shots
against the Penguins, who had won 11 of their first 12 playoff
games. Jordan Staal scored Pittsburgh's goals in the third
period, his second score coming with 5 minutes 49 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at
center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to
seal the victory. It was the second goal of the game for Lupul.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way,"
Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval,
the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with
Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
</P>
<P>
Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received
slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting
in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the
Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to
Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the
Penguins' other elite center.
</P>
<P>
But Stevens juggled his line combinations, placing Richards on
his stagnant top line, which includes Danny Briere and Scott
Hartnell. Vinny Prospal centered a line with R.J. Umberger and
Lupul.
</P>
<P>
Briere said he and Richards had chemistry on the power play
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
"I thought, wow, maybe that could work five-on-five," Briere
said. "So I was excited and enthusiastic about the idea."
</P>
<P>
Thirty seconds after a tripping penalty on Briere ended early in
the first period, Lupul stormed into the Penguins' zone and took
a slap shot at goaltender Marc-Andr? Fleury before he reached the
face-off circle. The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh
defenseman Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
Fleury flinched his left shoulder to try to stop the shot, but
the puck went in 8:27 into the first.
</P>
<P>
The crowd howled when Briere, pounded by the Penguins in the
series, was tripped by defenseman Sergei Gonchar, and Gonchar was
called for a penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Flyers scored on the power play, when Briere swept in the
rebound of a slap shot by defenseman Randy Jones at 11:48. Briere
reached the puck before Gill and knocked in his ninth playoff
goal as Gill was knocking him to the ice.
</P>
<P>
"I think we had a tough time containing them in front," Staal
said. "They're strong players."
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh defenseman Brooks Orpik picked up a roughing penalty
late in the first, and Jeff Carter scored a power-play goal with
1:10 left in the period by flicking in the rebound of a hard shot
by Umberger, making the score 3-0.
</P>
<P>
At the midway point of the first period, the Flyers had been
outshot by the Penguins, 11-4. But Philadelphia ended the period
with a 17-13 edge in shots. The Flyers had eight shots through
the first two periods of a 4-1 loss in Game 3 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We know they've got offensive power," Biron said. "We know they
can come up and score any time in the game. To have played the
way we played in the first period really gave us a chance to be
ready for their two goals in the third period. That gave us a
cushion."
