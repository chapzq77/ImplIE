"24" television series star Kiefer Sutherland pleaded guilty to
drunk driving Tuesday in a Los Angeles court where prosecutors
asked that he be jailed for 48 days.
</P>
<P>
Sutherland, 40, was arrested September 25 west of Los Angeles for
driving with an alcohol-level three times above the legal limit,
court documents show.
</P>

The actor was on probation for another drunk driving violation in
2004, for which Los Angeles prosecutor Rocky Delgadillo asked the
court he be sentenced to 18 days in jail, in addition to 30 days
for the current charge.
</P>
<P>
If the judge adheres to Delgadillo's recommendations, Sutherland
would have to serve the first 18-day sentence on December 21, and
the other 30-day sentence on July 1, 2008.
</P>
<P>
Sutherland's presence was not required at Tuesday's hearing. His
lawyer entered the guilty plea.

The son of Fellini's "Casanova" star Donald Sutherland, Kiefer
Sutherland just finished shooting the sixth season of "24," whose
role as US secret agent Jack Bauer earned him a Golden Globe
award in 2002 and an Emmy Award in 2006.
