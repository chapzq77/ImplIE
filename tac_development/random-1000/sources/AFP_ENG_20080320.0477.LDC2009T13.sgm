Swimming: Don't write off Hackett for Beijing gold, says coach
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one should doubt Australian Grant Hackett's ability to claim
his third Olympic gold medal in the 1500-metres freestyle at this
year's Beijing Games, head coach Alan Thompson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Heading into this weekend's Olympic trials here, Thompson said
the world record holder has come a long way since last year's
world championships when he struggled home in seventh place in
the 1500m.
</P>
<P>
Poland's Mateusz Sawrymowicz ended Hackett's four-title world
domination of the 1500m at the worlds and South Korean Park Tae-
Hwan completed Hackett's misery by upsetting the defending
champion in the 400m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in Australia wondered whether Grant would
continue on swimming after the world championships last year, or
whether he could get back to his best," Thompson told a press
conference here ahead of Saturday's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
"I would suggest, though, we'll be waiting for the Olympic Games
to see Grant at his absolute, absolute best, but he may surprise
us all again."
</P>
<P>
Off the back of solid performances in Europe and a win in the
1500m at the Japan Open, Thompson said Hackett looked set to
perform well over the next week at the trials.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should ever doubt a champion like Grant," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"He's certainly of great value to our team.
</P>
<P>
"As the team captain he may only talk to the team once or maybe
twice... but what he does in the pool is something that is very
important to our team and he's a great leader without standing up
and talking about it, and just leading by his example.
</P>
<P>
"(At the world championships in Melbourne) I don't think his
performances affected our team in a negative way. I think a lot
of people felt for him, but when Grant performs very well they
certainly affect our team in a very positive way."
</P>
<P>
Hackett, who holds the 1500m world record at 14:34.56, set at the
2001 Fukuoka world championships, is scheduled to hold a pre-meet
press conference on Friday.
