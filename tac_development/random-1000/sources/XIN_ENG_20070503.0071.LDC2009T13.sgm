NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Falling food prices lowered Kenya's overall annual inflation rate
to 5.7 percent in April from 5.9 percent in March this year, the
country's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the CBS said that the underlying inflation rate,
which excludes changes in the prices of food items, declined to
5. 9 per cent in April from 6.1 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 1.3 percent from
March to April," the CBS said.  The CPI is a measure of the
average change in prices over time in fixed market baskets of
goods and services typically purchased by consumers.
</P>
<P>
The statement said food and nonalcoholic drinks index eased by
2.1 percent in April compared with March. This, according to the
CBS, was mainly attributed to a fall in prices of tomatoes,
kales, maize flour, sugar and maize grain.
</P>
<P>
The power and fuel index declined by 0.9 percent due to a drop in
the cost of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans are expected to pay less for fuel and electric power,
whose costs were expected to remain low following increased
hydroelectric capacity, buoyed by heavy rains and flooding.
</P>
<P>
CBS collects data every second and third week of each month from
retail outlets in 13 urban centers in Kenya, perceived to be a
representative of spending patterns of urban households.
