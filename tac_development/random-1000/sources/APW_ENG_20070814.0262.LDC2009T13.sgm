China's retail sales rose 16.4 percent in July over the year-
earlier period, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales totaled 699.8 billion yuan (US$92.3 billion;
euro67.7 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
Sales of grain and oil rose 45 percent, while sales of meat,
poultry and eggs grew 51 percent, the agency said, reflecting
recent sharp increases in food prices. The government reported
Monday that food prices climbed 15.4 percent in July over the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is trying to boost domestic consumption to reduce the
economy's reliance on exports. Growth in retail spending has
lagged behind that of exports, which soared more than 34 percent
in July.
