FRENCH COURT BACKS NEWSPAPER THAT PRINTED CARTOONS OF MUHAMMAD

<P>
A French court ruled Thursday in favor of a satirical weekly
newspaper that faced charges brought by two Muslim groups after
it published cartoons featuring the Prophet Muhammad that had
caused an international uproar when a Danish newspaper published
most of them.
</P>
<P>
The charges, brought by the Paris Mosque and the Union of Islamic
Organizations of France, accused the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo,
and its editor, Philippe Val, of "publicly abusing a group of
people because of their religion."
</P>
<P>
The charges could have resulted in a six-month prison term for
Val and a fine of about $29,000 against the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In its Feb. 8, 2006, issue, Charlie Hebdo republished 12 drawings
that appeared in September 2005 in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-
Posten, some of them lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. The
publication in Denmark set off deadly rioting across parts of the
Muslim world and resulted in Muslim boycotts of Danish products.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Hebdo published the cartoons in solidarity with the
Danish newspaper and to make a point about freedom of expression
in France, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the cover of its Feb. 8, 2006, issue, Charlie Hebdo published
an original drawing by the French cartoonist Cabu depicting a
crying Muhammad with his head in his hands, saying, "It's hard to
be loved by idiots."
</P>
<P>
The publication in France set off a public debate on the
country's devotion to its secular ideals. While France has limits
on public expression, particularly with regard to racist speech,
enforcement varies according to the national mood and penalties
for infractions are usually low.
</P>
<P>
The court acknowledged that one of the cartoons, which depicted
Muhammad wearing a turban shaped like a bomb, might offend some
Muslims. But it said that, given the context of its publication,
it saw no "deliberate intention of directly and gratuitously
offending the Muslim community."
</P>
<P>
Last September, a Danish court rejected a similar lawsuit against
Jyllands-Posten.
</P>
<P>
Val called the ruling a victory for freedom of speech and secular
French Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Islamic Organizations of France said it would appeal
the decision. The Paris Mosque said through its lawyer that it
probably would not.
