Zhang Wenkang -- open on AIDS, less so on SARS -- set to lose job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang, who is likely to lose his job
over SARS, ironically hit the headlines in the past by representing a
more open line on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was removed Sunday as chief of the Communist Party branch for
the Ministry of Health, state media said, in an indication that his
days as minister may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, stripping an official of his party position is
usually the prelude to sacking him from his government job.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he
told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been
put "under control".
</P>
<P>
Since then, several reports have emerged of a systematic cover-up of
the extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China,
involving especially military hospitals in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's
extensive background within military medicine.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than
three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
Until 1990 he served in various positions at the PLA's Second Medical
University, before becoming deputy director of health at the PLA
General Logistics Department until 1993.
</P>
<P>
After a series of positions outside the PLA, Zhang was appointed
health minister in 1998, as a member of what was considered a more
capable and active Cabinet under then-premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including
creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the
spread of AIDS in China.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several
frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could
have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.
