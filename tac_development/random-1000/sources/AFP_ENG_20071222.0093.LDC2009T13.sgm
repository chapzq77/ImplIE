European leaders celebrate fallen borders where Iron Curtain once
stood
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EU, Slovenian and Hungarian dignitaries took part in a last round
of celebrations Saturday to welcome nine mainly eastern European
countries into the passport-free Schengen zone.
</P>
<P>
A day after borders were lifted, making it now possible to travel
from Estonia to Portugal without passport controls, top officials
gathered in Skofije on the Italian-Slovenian border for a final
ceremony that ended three days of festivities along the path of
the former Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
"Something is happening today that 15 years ago, we could not
have even dreamt of: the physical borders are falling," Slovenian
Prime Minister Janez Jansa said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He recalled: "Twenty years ago at this very border -- which was
then still the border of Yugoslavia -- people were shot at if
they tried to cross illegally."
</P>
<P>
"That was Europe 20 years ago, Europe divided, a great part of
Europe without access to freedom," European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso added.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I can't be pessimistic about the future (of the EU),
when I see where we are now and where we come from."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the lifting of the barriers was more than a
symbolic or political gesture, and that it had "concrete meaning"
for Europeans, allowing easier travel, improving relations
between states and enhancing growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
Some older Schengen countries have voiced concern that the new
members will not be able to ensure security and that eastern
European criminals will descend en masse on Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said: "We can assure
you that yesterday's opening of the borders did not represent a
drop of security, but an increase of freedom."
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, the first former Yugoslav state to join the European
Union and the eurozone, will now control 760 kilometres (472
miles) of the Schengen border.
</P>
<P>
But Jansa predicted that the passport-free zone would extend
further still in the future: "The expansion of the Schengen area
is not over yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, whose country currently
holds the rotating EU presidency, noted meanwhile: "We celebrate
the best of Europe, the best of European values, democracy,
peace, freedom... Congratulations to Italy, Slovenia, and viva
Europa!"
</P>
<P>
Symbolically handing over the six-month rotating EU presidency to
Slovenia, he added: "I cannot imagine a better way to finish a
presidency."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Socrates had taken part in another ceremony at
Hegyeshalom, on the Austro-Hungarian border near Slovakia,
alongside Barroso, Hungarian premier Ferenc Gyurcsany, his
Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico and Austrian Interior Minister
Guenther Platter.
</P>
<P>
Despite the biting cold, the leaders were all smiles as they
posed in front of a sign proclaiming a "borderless Europe" in
several languages, and Gyurcsany declared: "We are prepared to
defend and strengthen Europe as proud Hungarians."
</P>
<P>
Platter added: "With the opening of the borders, we have overcome
the partition of Europe. This is a great day for Austria, for all
new Schengen states and most of all for Europe."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony ended with the inauguration of a monument indicating
the distances from Hegyeshalom to all European capitals.
</P>
<P>
At midnight on Friday, nine new countries -- the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and
Slovenia -- joined the 15 nations already in the no-passport
Schengen zone.
</P>
<P>
European leaders hailed the entry of these mainly ex-communist
states into Schengen as border posts were symbolically lifted or
sawed through, less than 20 years after the fall of the Iron
Curtain.
</P>
<P>
A total of 400 million people from 24 countries will now be able
to move freely throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
The old signatories of the 1985 Schengen Agreement included
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain and Sweden.
