LONDON 2007-03-29 11:24:54 UTC

<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's office on Thursday condemned the
decision to show captured British sailors and marines on Iranian
television.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be put in that position. It is an impossible
position to be put in," said Blair's spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy. "It is
wrong. It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover
this. It is wrong in terms of basic humanity."
</P>
<P>
Iran captured 15 British sailors and marines last week in the
Shatt al Arab waterway between Iraq and Iran. Britain insists the
crew were in Iraqi waters when they were captured; Tehran claims
they had entered Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
In video footage aired Wednesday, the only woman captive said her
group had "trespassed" in Iranian waters; other images showed the
group eating together.
</P>
<P>
Britain angrily denounced the video as unacceptable and froze
most of its dealings with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Britain wanted to resolve the crisis quickly
and without having a "confrontation over this."
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner. We are simply
saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been
seized in the first place,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki announced on
Wednesday that British officials in Tehran would be given
consular access to the seized personnel, but British officials
said they were still waiting for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman dismissed Mottaki's suggestion that Britain should
resolve the crisis by admitting that its personnel had made a
"mistake" and crossed into Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
"The facts are the facts," he said.
