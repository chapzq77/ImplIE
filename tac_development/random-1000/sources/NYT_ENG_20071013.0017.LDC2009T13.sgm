TAMPA  The Bucs likely will have to stop Titans quarterback Vince
Young without starting cornerback Brian Kelly. The 10-year
veteran has not practiced this week and is doubtful for Sunday's
home game.
</P>
<P>
Kelly strained his groin in the opener and has missed one game
and left three others early.
</P>
<P>
"He could go, I'm sure. He's just unable to go 100 percent,"
coach Jon Gruden said Friday. "We have to get him well. We have
11 games to go. The guys he is covering are 100 percent, and when
you are playing the cornerback position, you have to be able to
turn and run and get out of transition."
</P>
<P>
Phillip Buchanon will start at left cornerback. He has 22
tackles, including a season-high 10 on Sunday, and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing great, covering great," Gruden said. "He's
been a quick study.
</P>
<P>
"And that's impressive because we're pressing him into service on
short notice."
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Barrett Ruud (knee), receiver Ike Hilliard (shoulder)
and defensive end Greg White (neck) practiced and are
questionable.
</P>
<P>
CARRYING THE LOAD: Look for Earnest Graham to get the bulk of the
rushing load with rookie Kenneth Darby backing him up.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is (Graham is) in tremendous physical shape, and
as much as he can take, he'll get," Gruden said. "He's excited
about it. We're confident he can do a good job. We're taking the
training wheels off."
</P>
<P>
Graham's new rushing role will affect another unit.
</P>
<P>
"As his role changes, his role and involvement on special teams
has to change," Gruden said. "We need someone to pick up the
slack there."
</P>
<P>
titans injuries: Defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth practiced
for the first time this week and expects to play. He hurt his
ankle Sunday while leapfrogging an offensive lineman to disrupt a
late goal-line run. Brandon Jones, Tennessee's leading receiver,
has not practiced because of a sore knee. Coach Jeff Fisher said
he will be a game-time decision.
