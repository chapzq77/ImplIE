Judge bars footage of Anna Nicole breast surgery

LOS ANGELES 2008-10-04 02:48:25 UTC

<P>
A judge ordered a Texas doctor and his wife on Friday not to
distribute videotaped footage of Anna Nicole Smith's breast
augmentation surgery in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The order settles alawsuit filed last year by Howard K. Stern,
the executor of Smith's estate, who was trying to stop Dr. Gerald
Johnson and his wife from distributing the tapes of the former
Playboy Playmate and reality star who died last year.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff issued
preliminary injunctions against the Johnsons more than a year ago
before issuing his final decision.
</P>
<P>
Stern maintained that Smith never consented to the taping or to
allowing the footage to be seen by Los Angeles memorabilia dealer
Thomas Riccio, who got tapes from the Johnsons, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
Johnson has said he routinely records surgeries with the
patient's permission and promises to keep the video confidential
"during the patient's lifetime."
</P>
<P>
He said he gave Riccio permission to use the video after Smith
died of a drug overdose in February 2007 in Florida. She was 39.
Riccio's daughter edited the footage into a five-minute tape,
scored with music similar to the theme from the film "Jaws."
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons' Houston-based attorney, Gus Pappas, did not return
a message seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
Larry Birkhead, who fathered Smith's daughter, called the video
"truly disgusting" in a sworn declaration issued last year.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that Anna Nicole was unconscious during the
videotaping, and even more disturbing, the videotape focused on
areas of her nude body that were unrelated to the location of the
surgery," he said in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Stern's attorney, Vivian Thoreen, said all the tapes have been
accounted for under the judge's previous orders. She said the
other terms of the settlement are confidential.
</P>
<P>
Although the Johnsons live in Texas, the Los Angeles Superior
Court still has jurisdiction because the physician allegedly
tried to disseminate the tape in Los Angeles County, said
attorney Bruce S. Ross, who also represents Stern.
