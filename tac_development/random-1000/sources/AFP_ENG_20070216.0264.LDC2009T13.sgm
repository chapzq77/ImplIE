Football: Rangers welcome Ferguson all-clear from UEFA
</HEADLINE>

Rangers boss Walter Smith on Friday welcomed a UEFA decision to
take no action against Barry Ferguson over an altercation with a
Hapoel Tel Aviv player in the club's UEFA Cup defeat in Israel
this week.
</P>
<P>
Gers captain Ferguson appeared to strike Hapoel's Tal Chen after
being floored by Luciano De Bruno during the 2-1 first leg defeat
on Wednesday, and afterwards Hapoel's coach Nir Levin called on
UEFA to look at the incident.
</P>
<P>
But European football's governing body have since confirmed to
Rangers that they will not be taking the matter further, ensuring
Ferguson will not be banned for the return leg at Ibrox next
week.

<P>
"Common sense has prevailed," said Smith. "After seeing the
incident on TV I don't think there was too much in it. It was
just a reaction from Barry and it was the Hapoel player who was
responsible by poking his finger at Barry as he lay on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
"So we are pleased with UEFA's decision and that the matter is
now out of the way."
