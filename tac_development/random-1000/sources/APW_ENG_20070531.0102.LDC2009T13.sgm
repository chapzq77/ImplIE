ACLU: Boeing subsidiary enabled CIA torture activities
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 2007-05-31 00:31:08 UTC

<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union sued a subsidiary of Boeing
Co., claiming it provided secret CIA transportation services for
three terrorism suspects who were tortured under the U.S.
government's "extraordinary rendition" program.
</P>
<P>
The cases involve the alleged mistreatment of Binyam Mohamed, an
Ethiopian citizen, in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim
Britel, an Italian citizen, in May 2002; and Ahmed Agiza, an
Egyptian citizen, in December 2001, ACLU officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed is currently being held in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba; Britel
in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt, the ACLU said in a statement. The
three have claimed through their family and lawyers that they
have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal
standards. Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
California, charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen
Dataplan, Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the men
to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and
subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment."
</P>
<P>
Mike Pound, a spokesman for Jeppesen, said company officials had
not yet seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
He said Jeppesen provides support services, rather than the
flights themselves, for airlines, private pilots and companies.
"We don't know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight
plan," he said. "We don't need to know specific details. It's the
customer's business, and we do the business that we are
contracted for. It's not our practice to ever inquire about the
purpose of a trip."
</P>
<P>
Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm
the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale,
adding that customers have a confidentiality clause.
</P>
<P>
"Either (Jeppesen) knew or reasonably should have known that they
were facilitating a torture program," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner
said.
</P>
<P>
Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand, and
take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to
foreign countries to be tortured," said Wizner.
</P>
<P>
Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit.
Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets
defense in similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit says Jeppesen "furnished essential flight and
logistical support to aircraft used by the CIA to transfer terror
suspects to secret detention and interrogation facilities in
countries such as Morocco and Egypt where, according to the U.S.
Department of State, the use of torture is `routine,' as well as
to U.S.-run detention facilities overseas, where the United
States government maintains that the safeguards of U.S. law do
not apply."
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from
countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be
tortured.
</P>
<P>
The ACLU said its lawsuit was being filed under the Alien Tort
Statute, which permits aliens to bring claims in the United
States for violations of the law of nations or a United States
treaty.
