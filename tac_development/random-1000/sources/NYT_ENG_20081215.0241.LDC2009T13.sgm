At least 23 people drowned and 33 others were missing after an
overloaded passenger ferry capsized off a northern Philippine
province, the coast guard said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said they recovered the bodies of 23 victims, who
drowned after huge waves overturned the Maejan, a ferry carrying
102 passengers, just 200 feet off the shoreline of Cagayan
province, north of Manila, on Sunday morning. Most of the
survivors managed to swim to shore.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the area was known for its big waves and strong
current. The Associated Press quoted Joseph Llopis, the mayor of
Calayan Island, as saying that hours before the ferry capsized,
"three children fell into the sea as the vessel was lashed by
huge waves." One of the dead was a 1-year-old.

Llopis said many of the victims were traveling to the mainland to
buy food for Christmas. "There'll be no festive mood," the mayor
said, according to an AP report. "Many of the dead were
breadwinners."

The coast guard said in a statement that the Maejan was buffeted
by "big waves and strong current until it was dragged and
capsized." Local police said that the ferry was entering the
mouth of the Cagayan River when it capsized. Rescue boats and
small planes were dispatched to look for survivors.

<P>
Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo, chief of the Philippine Coast Guard,
said the Maejan was authorized to carry only 50 passengers and
that criminal charges would be filed against its owners for
overloading the ferry.

Accidents at sea are common in the Philippines, particularly
toward the end of the year, when the monsoon season peaks.

Last month, a passenger ferry capsized in the central Philippines
after being struck by strong winds. More than 40 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
In June, the Princess of the Stars, a passenger ship with 850
passengers and crew, sank in the central Philippines after being
lashed by a typhoon. Only 57 people survived; the authorities are
still trying to recover bodies.
</P>
<P>
The world's worst sea disaster since World War II occurred in the
central Philippines, in December 1987, when the passenger ship
Dona Paz collided with an oil tanker, killing more than 4,300
people.
</P>
<P>
Apart from negligence and the unsafe state of many passenger
vessels, storms and typhoons play a crucial role in these
accidents. About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines
every year.
