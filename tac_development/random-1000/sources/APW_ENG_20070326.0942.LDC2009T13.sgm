Guilty pleas in boat accident that killed 20 elderly tourists on
New York state lake

<P>
A cruise line and the captain of a boat that capsized on a New
York state lake, killing 20 elderly tourists, pleaded guilty
Monday to a misdemeanor charge.
</P>
<P>
Shoreline Cruises and Capt. Richard Paris pleaded guilty to not
having enough crew members aboard the Ethan Allen tour boat when
it overturned during a fall foliage cruise on Oct. 2, 2005,
throwing its passengers into the cold water of the Adirondack
Mountain lake.
</P>
<P>
Warren County Judge John Hall fined both Paris and the company
the maximum $250. Paris also agreed to serve more than 200 hours
of community service in lieu of 15 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
Paris was the only crew member aboard; state navigation law
required at least two for the 47 passengers that day.
</P>
<P>
District Attorney Kate Hogan had said a more serious charge of
criminal negligence was not supportable because there was not
enough evidence to show the operators knew the boat would
capsize.
</P>
<P>
Paris said he was eager to get the whole situation behind him.
"It's over," he said outside court.
</P>
<P>
James Quirk, Shoreline Cruises' owner, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
At least nine civil lawsuits are pending over the drownings.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
believe the 40-foot (12.19 meters) boat was rocked by a wake
produced by on or more passing boats. A grand jury heard
conflicting testimony from survivors -- some said there was no
wake, others said it was 6 to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters).
</P>
<P>
The federal board concluded last year that the boat was
dangerously unstable and should have carried only a quarter of
the passengers onboard.
</P>
<P>
The Ethan Allen was certified to carry 48 passengers plus two
crew, according to weight limits that have since been modified.
There were 48 people on the boat -- including Paris -- when it
capsized, but federal investigators said the boat should not have
been certified to carry that many people.
</P>
<P>
The boat's passenger capacity was calculated when it was
manufactured in 1966, but modifications over the years made it
less stable and its capacity should have been slashed to 14
people, the NTSB reported.
