<P>
Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into
vaccine trials by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline in
Russia that were allegedly conducted on children without parents'
permission.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutor General's office said in a statement dated Monday
and posted on its Web site Friday that investigators began the
probe at a hospital in Volgograd, about 900 kilometers (550
miles) southeast of Moscow, after several children who received
the vaccines fell ill and parents raised questions.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 children between the ages of one and two were given
the vaccines during the trails, which have since been halted, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the deputy director of the hospital had been
paid US$50,000 (euro38,000) to participate in the trials and that
such tests on minors were illegal in Russia. They also said
parents had been told the vaccines were humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
GlaxoSmithKline officials could not be immediately reached for
comment, but Michael Crow, the head of GSK's Russian operations,
told Dow Jones Newswires that the allegations were
unsubstantiated and untrue.
</P>
<P>
"All of our trials undergo rigorous scrutiny and this study had
been fully authorized by all the necessary Russian agencies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Crow said the tests began in 2005 as part of a wider study of
pediatric vaccines Varilrix, Priorix and Priorix Tetra on 5,700
children across Europe. Of those, 1,000 were in Russia and 100
participated in the study in Volgograd, he said.
