<HEADLINE>
ONE SENATOR STANDS IN WAY OF OPEN GOVERNMENT BILL

<P>
WASHINGTON-Legislation that would strengthen the beleaguered
Freedom of Information Act had all the makings of what Capitol
Hill politicos call a "hotline bill."
</P>
<P>
It cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote. More
than 100 groups from across the political spectrum support it.
The House approved a companion measure by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sits in limbo.
</P>
<P>
The reason?
</P>
<P>
Arizona Republican Senator Jon Kyl.
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that Kyl was the one who invoked a parliamentary
procedure known as a "secret hold" last month to block the bill
from sailing through the Senate without debate.
</P>
<P>
With just one objection, the bill went from "hotline" status to a
legislative black hole.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot overestimate the power of each U.S. senator," said
Robert B. Dove, the former parliamentarian of the Senate. By
placing the hold on the measure, Kyl is assured that nothing
passes without his support, he said.
</P>
<P>
Open government advocates are blitzing Capitol Hill in a last-
ditch effort to win approval for the measure before Congress
recesses for the Fourth of July holiday-the 41st anniversary of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
"It is a shocking story that goes far beyond this particular
bill," said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on
Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. "It
really illustrates how Congress has become dysfunctional."
</P>
<P>
Kyl's hold on the Open Government Act eliminates majority rule in
favor of the "idiosyncrasies of one individual," Aftergood said.
"It's hard to see how government can function this way."
</P>
<P>
So far, the open government groups -conservative and liberals
included--have been unsuccessful in budging Kyl.
</P>
<P>
The Cornyn-Leahy bill attempts to reduce the long backlog of FOIA
requests by imposing consequences for missing the 20-day
statutory deadline. The bill establishes a FOIA hotline service
to track requests and creates an ombudsman to settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
Jim Manley, spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,
D-Nev., said the measure would not be brought up for debate
before the Fourth of July recess. "Senator Reid has worked hard
to clear Republican objections and wants it to the floor as soon
as possible," Manley said.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring it to the floor for debate, Reid needs Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to sign off. To date, McConnell
has not responded to a request to allow two hours of debate on
the measure.
</P>
<P>
An aide to McConnell said that the debate proposal did not permit
discussion of Kyl's concerns. Until those concerns are addressed,
the bill will not move.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad day in democracy when an open government bill does
not see the light of day," said Rick Blum, director of the
Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups.
</P>
<P>
If Kyl has concerns, those concerns should be openly debated so
the bill can move forward, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
Kyl's office did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails
seeking comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
However, Kyl did list his objections to the bill in a Senate
Judiciary Committee report filed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Kyl, a Judiciary Committee member, baffled open government groups
because he objected in writing after allowing the measure to
clear the committee by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
"Although the goals of the Open Government Act are laudable, the
bill reported by the committee has a number of flaws that must be
addressed," Kyl said in his dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates
exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails
to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.
</P>
<P>
Kyl was concerned that the provision would inadvertently release
sensitive information about national security.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department concurs, calling it a "Draconian remedy
with enormous consequences" because it would lead to the
automatic release of all information with only a few narrow
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Kyl's list of concerns mirrors the Justice Department's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
And Kyl objects to a provision that would allow requesters to
seek attorneys fees when they challenge denials in federal court.
</P>
<P>
Kyl said this would reverse a U.S. Supreme Court decision known
as Buckhannon Board and Care Home v. West Virginia Dept. of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
The higher court ruled that a party suing the government is not
entitled to attorney's fees if the government voluntarily changed
its position and gave the plaintiff what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
Open government groups say this is an important provision.
</P>
<P>
They have testified that agencies are routinely delaying the
release of government records past the statutory 20-day deadline,
forcing FOIA requesters to mount an expensive legal challenge to
get the records. Some have reported that they spend thousands of
dollars in legal fees only to have the government cough up the
records in the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
Cornyn and Leahy have tried to address Kyl's concerns over the
past month.
</P>
<P>
Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, personally
appealed to Kyl, a fellow member of the panel, to no avail,
according to a senior Democratic staffer.
</P>
<P>
Cornyn and Leahy have eliminated the provision that would bar
agencies from asserting exemption to a FOIA request if they
failed to meet the 20-day deadline set by law.
</P>
<P>
Staffers for Cornyn and Leahy say they are hopeful that Kyl will
ultimately support the measure.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Cornyn does not comment on private conversations he
might have with other senators, but suffice to say, this bill is
one of his top priorities," said Brian Walsh, spokesperson for
Cornyn. "He believes the Senate should act on this good
government legislation as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The law needs to be improved, Leahy said. The law is hampered by
excessive delays and lax agency compliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less
likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIA's 41-year
history," Leahy said. "This bill would help to reverse this trend
and to restore the public's trust in their government."
