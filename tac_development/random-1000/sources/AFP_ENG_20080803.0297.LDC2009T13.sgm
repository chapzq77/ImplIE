UNICEF head concerned over spread of HIV in Mozambique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the UN's children fund has raised concerns over the
spread of HIV in Mozambique, saying it was partly fueled by
immigrants from Zimbabwe who were selling their bodies to make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF executive director Ann Veneman told reporters at the end
of a three-day official visit on Saturday that her organisation
"was concerned by high levels of HIV infection in the country."
</P>
<P>
"We are working with the ministry of the interior in dealing with
uncontrolled immigration of Zimbabwean women who are engaged in
sexual activities in central Mozambique."
</P>
<P>
She did not give details of the organisation's work with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of women are believed to have fled poverty-stricken
Zimbabwe, labouring under the world's highest inflation rate and
major food shortages, to work as prostitutes in neighbouring
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
According to government figures, Mozambique's HIV prevalence rate
among the 16-to-49 age group is estimated at more than 16
percent. However some aid groups say the figure is higher.
