Chavez: Bush's Latin American tour 'destined' to fail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday dismissed the
upcoming Latin American tour of his US nemesis George W. Bush as
a "diplomatic offensive" that is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
"It is a diplomatic offensive ... but it is too late," Chavez
said in a news conference. "I think the US president has nothing
to look for in Latin America. It is an offensive destined for the
depths of defeat."
</P>
<P>
The leftist leader, who has been accused by the United States of
being a destabilizing force in the region and of threatening
democracies with his behavior, said he respected the right of
other Latin American leaders to meet Bush.
</P>
<P>
"We, of course, would never invite him because we know what he
is," Chavez said, adding that he hoped the 2008 US presidential
election would bring a government he can talk with. Bush is
barred from running by term limits.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the next US government is one we can talk with, and I
say this not only for Venezuela but also the world, because the
current US government is a real threat," said Chavez, who has
called Bush the devil.
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to travel to Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia,
Guatemala and Mexico between March 8-14.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said the trip will "underscore the commitment
of the United States for the Western Hemisphere and will
highlight our common agenda to advance freedom, prosperity and
social justice."
</P>
<P>
US-Venezuelan relations have nose-dived since Chavez was first
elected in 1998. The South American leader, who was reelected in
December, has moved closer to other US foes including Iran and
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
His domestic critics argue he has moved aggressively to
consolidate power over the legislature, courts and other sectors
of society, at times struggling with independent media.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Chavez said that in Venezuela "there is so much free
expression that some times it goes too far, (Brazilian President
Luiz Inacio) Lula (da Silva) once told me so."
</P>
<P>
And he lashed out at a Brazilian correspondent with O Globo
television who gave a report Chavez saw as critical, saying to
the journalist: "You are meddling with something that is sacred:
our country's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chavez also charged that there were new plans to
assassinate him, although he did not identify the plotters.
</P>
<P>
"There are four or five maniacs who continue working to kill Hugo
Chavez," he said. "There are assassination plans being prepared,
one of which has deepened in the last few days and months."
