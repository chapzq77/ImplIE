Flood damage allows African migrants to enter Spanish enclave
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Around 40 African migrants took advantage of flood damage at the
border to cross into Spain's North African enclave of Melilla
from Morocco on Monday, police and local government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people were detained shortly after entering Spanish
territory while the rest managed to enter the city of roughly
70,000 people which was lashed by heavy rain and strong winds on
Sunday, a local police spokeswoman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65 migrants tried to enter through a lock in a flood
channel near the border post of Beni-Enzarhich which was damaged
by the rough weather and could not be closed properly, she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday the Spanish government's office in Melilla said
about 30 African migrants tried to cross into Melilla from
Morocco at the border checkpoint and an unknown number had
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Melilla has boosted police presence along its border with Morocco
after Sunday's heavy rains destroyed a 30-metre (yard) stretch of
wire fencing set up to keep illegal immigrants out of the city.
</P>
<P>
The rain also flooded streets, knocked down trees and disrupted
maritime and air traffic for several hours on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The border barriers between Melilla and Morocco have been
regularly assaulted in the past by migrants trying to enter
Spanish territory, although tighter border security has reduced
the frequency of such attempts.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, 14 migrants were killed while they tried to cross the
border. They included several shot by Moroccan or Spanish
security forces during assaults on the borders of Melilla and
Ceuta, another Spanish enclave in North Africa. Both Ceuta and
Melilla are claimed by Morocco.
