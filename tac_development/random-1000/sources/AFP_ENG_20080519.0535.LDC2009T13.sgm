to 6,035.0.

Risers outnumbered decliners 698 to 598 with 334 stocks
unchanged. About 1.7 billion shares worth around 5.1 billion
dollars (4.8 billion US) were traded.

Dealers said early gains were pared back as investors moved to
take profits after four weeks of rises.

"The market ran out of puff after opening with a great deal of
gusto on some fairly strong gains by BHP and oil stocks," said
Michael Heffernan, a private client advisor at Austock
Securities.
</P>
<P>
"There was probably a little bit too much optimism to start with
but the market still being positive is encouraging -- we're
almost near the 6,000 points which is an absolutely astonishing
recovery from where it was just two months ago."
</P>
<P>
The key market indices have risen nearly 17 percent since mid-
March lows.

Oil and gas leader Woodside Petroleum surged 10 percent to a

The major banks were mostly lower amid speculation that there
could be a counterbid for the country's fifth largest bank, St
George, following Westpac's friendly all-paper offer.
