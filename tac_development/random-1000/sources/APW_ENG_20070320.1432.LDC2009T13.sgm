More than $300 million (euro225.6 million) in previously unpaid
insurance claims were awarded to 48,000 Holocaust survivors for
harm they suffered during World War II, an international
commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims
concluded its claims and appeals process after a worldwide
outreach campaign began in 1998 to ensure that insurance
companies fulfilled their obligations.
</P>
<P>
Its review was able to match those survivors submitting claims
with more than 70 European insurance companies and businesses.
</P>
<P>
"I fully recognize that no amount of compensation can redress the
suffering inflicted during the Holocaust," said Lawrence
Eagleburger, who chaired the commission. Still, he said, the
panel "has achieved its goal of bringing a small measure of
justice to those who have been denied it for so long."
</P>
<P>
The group was charged with expeditiously addressing, at no cost
to claimants, unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust
victims.
