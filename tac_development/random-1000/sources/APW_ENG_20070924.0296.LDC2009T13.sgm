In a speech from his hospital, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
apologized on Monday to the nation for the "worst possible
timing" of his sudden resignation.

Abe, 53, announced on Sept. 12 he wanted to quit, and promptly
checked into a hospital the following day for stress-related
intestinal ailments.

The resignation threw the Japanese political world into
confusion. The ruling party on Sunday chose moderate Yasuo Fukuda
to succeed him.
