Chinese quake volunteer saves 700, but not his wife
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Working tirelessly amid the mangled mess of steel and concrete in
what was the town of Beichuan, Liu Wenbo has helped save 700
people. But not his wife.
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's 7.9-magnitude earthquake tore apart this valley
town in southwestern China, the 34-year-old was a tea salesman.
Starting Tuesday, he donned military fatigues, a face mask and a
red armband marking him as a volunteer trying to find survivors
of his former neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
He says that his team has saved some 700 people. But so far not
his wife or their parents.
</P>
<P>
"I no longer have a wife and I lost my house. All I've got are
the clothes that I'm wearing," he says with a blank look behind
his small oval glasses.
</P>
<P>
He had tried in vain to call his wife by mobile telephone.
</P>
<P>
"It's hopeless," he says, standing on a pile of clothes and other
assorted objects left from his once happy life, including
pictures of him with his wife
</P>
<P>
"They're down here," he says of his wife and in-laws, looking at
the ground.
</P>
<P>
One hundred metres (yards) away, soldiers hauling a stretcher
race to safety with an injured person. But the task is made all
the more difficult for the lack of ambulances.
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers are trying to open up a pathway through the mountains
as the onetime road has been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jun, 28, another volunteer, managed to come here by foot
from Mianyang, some 80 kilometres (45 miles) away in the plains
where he works in computers at a technical school.
</P>
<P>
"I knew this place as I had been before. There was a river and a
road and there was a neighbourhood here, but it's become a
strange place for me," Tang says, clad in the overalls and helmet
of a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
Tang is taking part in relief operations alongside some of the
first foreigners to be on the ground, Americans who were already
based in Sichuan province with the International Committee of the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
"This morning our team saved four people but as time goes on our
hopes are fading," Tang said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have acknowledged that it is becoming
increasingly unlikely to find any survivors from the country's
worst disaster in a generation, which the government has killed
at least 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
While in previous disasters survivors have been found after two
weeks in the rubble, such experiences are considered miracles.
</P>
<P>
But people are not giving up hope in Beichuan, where everywhere
people head to the former apartments or offices of their loved
ones in the chance of good news.
</P>
<P>
One woman cannot stop crying. Soldiers have just pulled out the
body of her husband, who was trapped underneath a slab of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
An American rescue worker comes close and asks in Chinese, "Is he
alive?"
</P>
<P>
"He's dead," a soldier replies to her.
</P>
<P>
The woman goes back to her grim work of finding more survivors
while the soldiers take away the man's body on a door that has
become a makeshift stretcher.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, two policemen use electric wires to cover up another
corpse.
</P>
<P>
Near a building that is half destroyed, a rescue worker rushes
over as he hears a knocking sound in the rubble. He gets out
equipment to find where it is coming from. But there was no more
knocking.
