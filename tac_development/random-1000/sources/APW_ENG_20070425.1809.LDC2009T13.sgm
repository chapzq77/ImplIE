NEW YORK 2007-04-25 23:02:04 UTC

The top U.S. representative of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group
designated as a foreign terrorist organization, orchestrated a
covert campaign to finance its escalating conflict with military
forces in Sri Lanka, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karunakaran Kandasamy, 50, was ordered held without bail in
Brooklyn on charges of providing material support to terrorists.
If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the Tamil Tigers group has "covertly
operated within the United States, drawing on America's financial
resources and technological advances to further its war of terror
in Sri Lanka and elsewhere," U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Kandasamy's attorney, Charles Hochbaum, argued that as a
"political refugee" and U.S. citizen, his client deserved bail.
Prosecutor Jeffrey Knox countered that, if released, he
"certainly has the means to flee the country."
</P>
<P>
The arrest was the latest attempt by U.S. authorities to cut off
support for the group which, according to court papers, has
engaged "in terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings and
political assassinations," while fighting for an independent
homeland for ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation's north
and east.
</P>
<P>
Last year, its emissaries were charged in Brooklyn with
conspiring to buy surface-to-air missiles. Prosecutors also
alleged the defendants tried to bribe U.S. officials to remove
the group from the terrorism list.
</P>
<P>
A defense attorney for one of those defendants said the charges
would be vigorously contested.
</P>
<P>
An FBI raid on Kandasamy's office in Queens unearthed evidence
that he raised millions of dollars for the Tamil Tigers through a
front organization called the World Tamil Coordinating Committee,
the court papers said. He took orders from rebel leaders in Sri
Lanka, in South Asia, and arranged meetings there with supporters
"with backgrounds in engineering, technology, weaponry, medicine
and scientific fields," the papers said.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers have fought the Sri Lankan government since
1983, seeking independence from the ethnic Sinhalese-dominated
country after decades of discrimination against Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The civil war killed at least 65,000 people before a Norwegian-
brokered cease-fire was signed in 2002. The truce temporarily
halted the fighting, but more than 4,000 people have died since
late 2005, when violence flared again.
</P>
<P>
Violence has increased recently in Sri Lanka as the government
pushes to retake rebel-held territory in the east. The rebels
have struck back with bombings, their first-ever air raid on a
government air force base and several attacks at sea.
