Golf: Parnevik leads Swedish assault at Texas Open
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jesper Parnevik led a Swedish sweep of the top four spots on
Friday, firing a five-under par 65 in the second round of the
Texas Open.
</P>
<P>
With a round that included six birdies and a bogey, Parnevik sits
atop the leaderboard at 14-under 126.
</P>
<P>
He is four shots in front of Swedish countryman Mathias Gronberg,
who also recorded a five-under 65 on Friday on his way to a
10-under 130 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Parnevik is five strokes ahead of fellow Swedes Fredrik Jacobson
and Richard S. Johnson who are tied at 131 overall.
</P>
<P>
"He's probably a great front runner," Johnson said of Parnevik.
"I said to my caddie this morning, when (Parnevik) putts well, he
putts really well. And, I mean, he always hits it good. He's
going to shoot four or five under everyday if the weather is
going to continue being like this."
</P>
<P>
Jacobson made his presence felt on Friday afternoon, firing a
five-under 65 en route to a 131 overall. Johnson notched a four-
under 66 on the tournament's second day.
</P>
<P>
Parnevik tore through LaCantera Golf Course in Thursday's first
round, overcoming a bogey on his first hole to finish with 10
birdies in a career-best nine-under 61.
</P>
<P>
Parnevik is looking for his first PGA Tour victory since the 2001
Honda Classic.
</P>
<P>
"I think the course has played very easy," Parnevik said. "It's
always nice when you have a few to spare than the other way
around. I would like to be in the lead by as many as possible."
</P>
<P>
Justin Leonard shot a 67 to sit six shots off the pace. He carded
a 65 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dan Forsman and Japan's Shigeki Maruyama both are sitting in the
clubhouse at seven-under - seven shots back - after shooting 68s
on Friday. Seven players are tied at six-under in the crowded
field.
</P>
<P>
Chad Campbell, who won the Viking Classic last week, currently is
at 6-under for the event after firing a two-under 68 in Friday's
second round.
