Police identify Bosnian teen as gunman in Utah mall rampage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Tuesday identified an 18-year-old Bosnian immigrant as
the gunman who killed five people in a Utah shopping mall before
he was shot dead by police.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank said detectives were
still struggling to find a motive behind Solejman Talovic's
bloody assault on the historic Trolley Square complex on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talovic, whose family arrived in the United States about three or
four years ago, was killed after being cornered by an off-duty
police officer celebrating Valentine's Day early with his wife
when the teenager's killing spree began.
</P>
<P>
Burbank said Talovic had been armed with a shotgun and a pistol
and was carrying several rounds of ammunition in a backpack and a
waistband.
</P>
<P>
"This individual had one thing in mind. He was well prepared, he
had a backpack with numerous rounds of ammunition as well as an
additional firearm," Burbank said. "He had one purpose."
</P>
<P>
Burbank said the quick thinking of off-duty police officer Ken
Hammond from Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had cut short
Talovic's rampage, saving "numerous" lives.
</P>
<P>
Hammond had been having a Valentine's dinner with his wife and
left the restaurant where they were eating after hearing gunfire.
</P>
<P>
"The officer contained him until other officers arrived and
resolved the situation," Burbank said. "There's no question his
quick actions saved the lives of numerous other people."
</P>
<P>
Hammond played down descriptions of himself as a hero. "I was
just the one that was there," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
No further details on Talovic were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian community in Salt Lake City is reported to number
around 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Burbank said the condition of four people injured in the shooting
had improved early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said a 52-year-old man, two 28-year-old women, a 24-year-
old man and a 15 -year-old girl were killed in the attack, which
took place at around 6:45 pm Monday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported Talovic coolly moving through the 80-shop
mall, gunning down his victims.
</P>
<P>
"He was totally calm and didn't seem to be upset or mad or
anything. He was just completely tranquil. It was so bizarre,"
said Marie Smith, the manager of a toiletries store.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the northeastern US city of Philadelphia on Monday,
a lone gunman entered an office complex and opened fire, leaving
four people dead, including the attacker. A fifth person was
seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia incident, arising from an apparent business
dispute, happened at about 8:30 pm local time in an office
complex at the city's old naval base, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunman opened fire on at least four people before turning the
gun on himself. Police told the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper
that the shooting took place after a dispute during a company
board meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It appeared that the shooter was upset over something that was
going on inside the business," Deputy Police Commissioner Richard
Ross told the Inquirer.
