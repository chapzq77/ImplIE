Rescuers kept up their search Wednesday for more survivors from
an Indonesian ferry that sank in bad weather, holding out hope
that people could still be found alive four days after the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
At least 212 people have been rescued so far, most of them
plucked from life-rafts or clinging on to debris, but some 400
remain missing, said Navy Col. Jan Simamora, the head of the
search and rescue mission.

<P>
The survivors over the last 24 hours had drifted several hundred
kilometers (miles) from where the Senopati Nusantara sank just
before midnight Friday after being pounded by waves for 10 hours
during a violent storm, Simamora said.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our utmost to find more," Simamora told The
Associated Press. "We still hope that those in lifeboats are
still alive."
</P>
<P>
People in life-rafts or holding on to some form of buoyancy aid
can survive for days in Indonesia's warm tropical waters.
</P>
<P>
Simamora said that 12 bodies have recovered. Officials have
reported seeing some bodies in the ocean, while at least two
survivors said that many of the victims were trapped in the ship
when it sank.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the missing have flocked to hospitals and ports
along Java's coast, hoping their loved ones may turn up alive.
</P>
<P>
The Senopati Nusantara was nearing the end of a two-day journey
from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's
main island of Java. The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992,
had a capacity of 850 people.

<P>
Officials say bad weather was the cause of the accident.
