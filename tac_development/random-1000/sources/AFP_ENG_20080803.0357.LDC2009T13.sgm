At least 15 civilians killed in Mogadishu blast

A roadside bomb ripped through a group of female street cleaners
in Mogadishu early Sunday, killing at least 15 of them, witnesses
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The explosion went off in the southern K4 neighbourhood as dozens
of women supported by local NGOs gathered to sweep the area,
leaving scenes of carnage in the street.
</P>
<P>
"They were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked
the entire neighbourhood. I counted 15 bodies, most of them are
women who were torn to pieces," eyewitness Hasan Abdi Mohamed
said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said the explosion wounded around 40 people.
</P>
<P>
The blast was one of the deadliest incidents to hit civilians in
the restive Somali capital in weeks and local residents rushed to
help the wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The number of casualties is increasing," said Ali Hasan Adan,
another witness.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded
that I cannot estimate," he said. "There is blood everywhere,
dead and wounded people strewn across the street."
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragedy, I have never seen such carnage. From what I
can see, they are all women who were cleaning the area."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion
but hardline Islamist groups have routinely targeted military
convoys in the area with roadside bombs.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian troops came to the rescue of Somalia's embattled and
internationally- backed transitional government in late 2006,
ousting an Islamist militia that had briefly controlled large
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Islamist insurgents have since waged a deadly guerrilla war
against government targets, Ethiopian forces and African Union
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Civilians have borne the brunt of the fighting, with
international rights groups and aid agencies saying that at least
6,000 were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced over the
past year alone.
</P>
<P>
The Horn of Africa nation has been plagued by civil fighting and
defied more than a dozen peace initiatives since the 1991 ouster
of former president Mohamed Siad Barre led to chaos.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations sponsored a new peace initiative which led to
the signing on June 9 in Djibouti of a truce agreement between
the government and the main Islamist-dominated opposition
movement.
</P>
<P>
But the deal led to a split in the opposition, with hardliners
insisting Ethiopian troops should leave before negotiations
start.
</P>
<P>
Violence has continued to rock the capital almost daily and peace
efforts suffered another blow Saturday when two thirds of the
cabinet threatened to resign over alleged misuse of state
resources by Prime Minister Nur Hasan Husein.
</P>
<P>
The premier said in a press conference that he had not yet
received any minister's resignation but the move reflected
differences between himself and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed.
