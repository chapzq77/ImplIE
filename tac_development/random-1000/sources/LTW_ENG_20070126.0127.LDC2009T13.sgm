<HEADLINE>
Cheney Directed Effort to Discredit Wilson, Former Aide Testifies
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Vice President Cheney personally orchestrated his office's 2003
efforts to rebut claims that the administration used flawed
intelligence to justify the war in Iraq and discredit a critic
who he believed was making him look foolish, according to
testimony and evidence Thursday in the criminal trial of his
former chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Cheney dictated talking points for a White House briefing in the
midst of the controversy that summer, his former press aide,
Cathie Martin, testified, stressing that the CIA never told him
that a CIA-sponsored mission had found no real evidence that Iraq
was trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Aboard Air Force 2, on a trip back from the launch of a
battleship in Norfolk, Va., Cheney instructed his chief of staff,
Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, about responding to a Time magazine
reporter who questioned how the faulty intelligence on Iraq had
become one of the Bush administration's central arguments for
going to war.
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded
Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as
a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but
also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of
persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
</P>
<P>
Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's
role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account. She is the
first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and
Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson,
who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had
sought uranium for a weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents
provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and
margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss'
instruction.
</P>
<P>
Lea Anne McBride, Cheney's current spokesperson, said Thursday
evening that the vice president's office could not comment on the
case or evidence introduced in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Libby, 56, is charged with lying to investigators and a grand
jury about how the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA officer Valerie
Plame, was leaked to the media days after Wilson went public with
his claims that the administration had twisted his findings to
justify the war in Iraq. Libby has pleaded not guilty, contending
he misspoke and forgot about conversations he had with
journalists amid the crush of his duties. He is not charged with
the leak itself.
</P>
<P>
Martin recalled telling Cheney and Libby information from CIA
spokesman William Harlow that Wilson was the person sent to Niger
``and his wife works for the CIA.'' Martin is the fourth witness
from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned
Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge
he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to
improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense
without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness
about details no reasonable person could remember.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby
would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the
jury that his own memory was flawed.
</P>
<P>
Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney
insisted that the administration had significant evidence that
Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even
after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it
was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his
January 2003 State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
Cheney told Martin to alert the media that a highly classified
and recent National Intelligence Estimate indicated no doubts
about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium. The NIE actually mentioned
several doubts.
</P>
<P>
On college rule paper, in blue ink, Martin scribbled what Cheney
told her the press needed to know about the Niger controversy as
they conferred in his Capitol Hill office on July 7, 2003.
</P>
<P>
``As late as last October, the considered judgment of the intel
community was that SH (Saddam Hussein) had indeed undertaken a
vigorous effort to acquire uranium from Africa, according to NIE
(the National Intelligence Estimate),'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president,
said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists
were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then
personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Martin said that Cheney also determined the reply to questions
she had received from Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper about
the role the vice president's office had played in the Niger
trip. While flying back from Norfolk on the vice president's
plane, she mentioned to Libby the e-mailed questions from Cooper.
</P>
<P>
Libby later came to her seat in the back of the plane, holding a
handwritten card with notes he said were Cheney's instructions
about what to say to Cooper. Libby told her, Martin testified,
that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific
quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
</P>
<P>
Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that
reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their
side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the
administration. She said they directed her and her staff to begin
monitoring television reports on the Niger trip and provide daily
transcripts along with their usual canvas of printed stories
about the vice president's office.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge
that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut
Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to
leak Plame's name to the press.
</P>
<P>
``At no time did Vice President Cheney indicate to you that he
considered Valerie Wilson part of the story he wanted to get
out,'' attorney Theodore Wells said to Martin.
</P>
<P>
``I did not have a conversation with the vice president about
that,'' Martin responded.
