Environmental activists upset after Bush lets Navy use sonar
training

Conservationists criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's
decision to exempt the Navy from an environmental law so it can
continue using high-power sonar in its training off California --
a practice they say harms whales and other marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
The president's action will not allow the anti-submarine warfare
training to go forward because an injunction is in place, but the
Navy believes it will significantly strengthen its argument in
court. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy
exercises on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to
U.S. District Court to consider first.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while
traveling in the Middle East. In his memorandum, Bush said the
Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the
United States" and its national security.
</P>
<P>
Peter Douglas, the executive director of the California Coastal
Commission, which joined in the lawsuit to give the marine
mammals greater protections from sonar, called the exemption
unprecedented in California.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised at all," he said. "It's typical for this
Republican administration to ignore environmental protections
under the banner of fear."
</P>
<P>
Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and
ears. Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins
listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has
been fighting the Navy's sonar training, said the group would
challenge Bush's exemption.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month
requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone
along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts
to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises. Sonar
would have to be shut down when mammals were spotted within 2,200
yards (2,010 meters).
</P>
<P>
The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated
the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from
a section of that act. Complying with the environmental law would
"undermine the Navy's ability to conduct realistic training
exercises that are necessary to ensure the combat effectiveness
of carrier and expeditionary strike groups," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other
marine mammals. For example, the sound can hurt some species
while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand
why.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with
sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might
threaten its ships.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot in good conscience send American men and women into
potential trouble spots without adequate training to defend
themselves," said Roughead.
