KIEV, March 31 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 Ukrainians gathered in Kiev on Monday to protest
against the U.S. President George W. Bush's visit, and the
Ukraine's bid for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Activists on Kiev's Independence Square are showing the slogans
saying "Bush out of Ukraine," and "Yankee go home."
</P>
<P>
"If Ukraine is not accepted into the Membership Action Plan, we
will remove the tents. But if Ukraine joins the plan, we will
take more severe measures," a unnamed protest organizer told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that around 9,000 people are expected to take part in
the protest from March 31 through April 4.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's drive toward NATO membership has triggered domestic
parliamentary opposition protests amid widespread antipathy to
the NATO.
</P>
<P>
A survey published earlier this month said only 11 percent of
Ukrainians supported the idea of NATO membership, most Ukrainians
were against it.
</P>
<P>
Bush will arrive in Ukraine on Monday evening for talks with
President Viktor Yushchenko expected to focus on Ukraine's plans
to join NATO Membership Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
During the April 2-4 meeting, NATO members will consider whether
to grant Croatia, Albania and Macedonia memberships. Bush has
made clear his support for Ukraine's membership plans, and is
likely to raise the issue at the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, European NATO members, in particular France and Germany,
have voiced opposition over allowing Ukraine into the alliance,
saying it would cause dangerous tensions with Ukraine's neighbor
Russia. Russia has warned it could target missiles at Ukraine if
the country joins NATO.
