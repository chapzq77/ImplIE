Football: Marseille call on family ties over fan's detention
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Champions League provided France's top three sides with
plenty of highs on the pitch midweek, but it's a incident off it
making headlines ahead of this weekend's domestic action.
</P>
<P>
Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux all posted excellent European wins,
but that has been overshadowed by the fate of one Marseille fan
facing an eight-year jail term following an incident at an
Atletico Madrid match.
</P>
<P>
The supporter, Santos Mirasierra, is accused of inciting
disorder, attacking a policemen and resisting arrest, and has
been detained in Spain since the incident on October 1.
</P>
<P>
And, instead of focusing on Saturday's match with Grenoble,
Marseille players were this week rallying to Mirasierra's cause.
</P>
<P>
"We have just learned that eight years have been called for,"
said team captain Lorik Cana on Thursday. "It's incongruous,
inexplicable, that shouldn't be happening."
</P>
<P>
"Not a day goes by without mention of Santos' name in the
dressing room," said coach Eric Gerets. "It's like that at
Marseille, it's a family, we never forget. It's high time he was
released."
</P>
<P>
Gerets said he was horrified by the reaction of police in
Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium, where it is alleged they
used excessive force to quell the unfolding violence on the
terraces.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time I was ashamed of what I saw in a stadium. The
police were hitting out at innocent people like animals," said
Gerets.
</P>
<P>
Returning to French league matters, Marseille goalkeeper Steve
Mandanda hit back at critics who have written off the second-
placed side's hopes catching leaders Lyon.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can still win the league," the 23-year-old French
international said. "We're four points behind Lyon but at this
stage of the season, that's nothing.
</P>
<P>
"We've shown how well we can play when everyone pulls in the same
direction. There's everything to play for in Ligue 1 and we've
shown we have the potential to go all the way this season."
</P>
<P>
Lyon travel to Monaco on Saturday on the back of a strong
Champions League performance to defeat Steaua Bucharest 2-0.
</P>
<P>
But the visitors will not have it all their own way in the
Principality, after Monaco's South Korean international Chu Young
Park last week engineered a 3-2 away win at Le Havre.
</P>
<P>
Third-placed side Bordeaux, who on Tuesday impressed on the
European stage by beating Cluj 2-1 in Romania thanks to a vintage
Wendel goal, host Auxerre as they bid to keep pace with the
leading pair.
