Even industrial-size fans couldn't beat the heat in Hell's
Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
John Alaimo, manager of a taxi repair shop in the Manhattan
neighborhood, said the fans only blow hot air around, doing
little to keep his mechanics cool.

"I buy these guys gallons of water just to keep them going," he
said. "I can't afford to put air conditioning in here."

The city put up a valiant fight against the second day of
temperatures in the 90s Fahrenheit (32-plus Celsius) as heat
gripped America from coast to coast. In Medford, Oregon, the
temperature was forecast to hit 105 (40.5 Celsius). Central Park
saw a high of 92 (33.3 Celsius), well below the 102-degree (38.8
Celsius) record set in 1993, but still unpleasant enough.

More than a week of high temperatures across the West has raised
wildfire concerns. Conditions have gotten "super-dry," said Roger
Peterson, a spokesman for the Northwest Interagency Coordination
Center. "And it's only going to get drier over the next few
days."
</P>
<P>
In the East, the heat spread as far south as Virginia, where
temperatures in the 90s prompted state officials to issue a
hazardous weather alert. Richmond opened three cooling shelters
Monday.

The West Virginia town of Bluefield offered free lemonade Tuesday
after temperatures surpassed 90 degrees (32.2 Celsius) the day
before, following a decades-old tradition.

In Washington, D.C., forecasters predicted a high of 96 degrees
(35.5 Celsius), which would feel like 101 Fahrenheit (38.3
Celsius) with the humidity.

New Jersey was more like a hothouse than a Garden State on
Tuesday as the humidity made it feel like 100 degrees (37.7
Celsius) in some places. But after thunderstorms moved through in
early afternoon, delaying flights across the Eastern Seaboard,
the temperature was down to 85 (29.4 Celsius) in Trenton and 88
(31 Celsius) in Atlantic City, officials said.

<P>
In New York, park officials said they would keep the city's 52
outdoor public pools open at least an extra hour. Nearly 300
cooling centers were opened for people without air conditioning.
Firefighters opened hydrants fitted with special sprinkler caps
to douse squealing children.

<P>
The operator of New York state's electrical grid said power use
was expected to peak Tuesday at more than 32,000 megawatts,
enough electricity to power about 32 million homes, as people
cranked up their air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The weather was expected to ease somewhat Wednesday,.
