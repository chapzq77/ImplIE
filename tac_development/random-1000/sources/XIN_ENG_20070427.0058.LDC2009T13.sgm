ABUJA, April 27 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The All Nigeria Peoples' Party ( ANPP) is planning to go to the
Election Petition Tribunal to seek redress of the outcome of
presidential poll, newspapers in Nigeria reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ANPP's plan was made on Thursday after it resolved
differences with its presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari on
what steps to take on the outcome of the April 21 election, the
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday
afternoon announced that Umaru Yar'Adua from the ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP) wins Nigerian presidential election with
24 million ballots.
</P>
<P>
But major opposition parties like the ANPP and Action Congress
claimed that they do not believe and would not accept the
election results.
</P>
<P>
The ANPP also said it would support mass action or any form of
civil protest by civil society organizations over the conduct of
April 14 and 21 poll, which it said, were massively rigged.
</P>
<P>
The National Chairman of ANPP Edwin Ume-Ezeoke made the party's
official position known at a press conference in Abuja on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Buhari and the party leadership met for many hours at the party
secretariat in Abuja, where they reached a consensus on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Buhari had reportedly opposed court action because of his
harrowing experience in 2003, when he spent three years before
the case was disposed off by the Supreme Court in favor of
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Chairman of the Media Committee of the ANPP Presidential
Campaign Osita Okechukwu said the party would not recognize Yar'
Adua's government, adding they "call for the total cancellation
of the presidential election while requesting for a fresh
election immediately."
</P>
<P>
He said the party would initiate moves through its elected
representatives in the National Assembly to sponsor a bill that
would reform the INEC so as to remove it from government's
interference.
