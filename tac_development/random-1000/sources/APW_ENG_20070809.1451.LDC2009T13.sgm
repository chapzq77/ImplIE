The Bank of Canada took an unusual step Thursday of publicly
reassuring investors that it will help provide stability to
financial markets and the domestic financial system.
</P>
<P>
"In light of current market conditions, the Bank of Canada would
like to assure financial market participants and the public that
it will provide liquidity to support the stability of the
Canadian financial system and the continued functioning of
financial markets," the central bank said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
Although these activities are part of the bank's normal
operations, it affirmed that it is closely monitoring
developments, and will deal with issues as they arise.
</P>
<P>
The bank's increased participation in the money markets stems
from Thursday's turbulent Canadian and U.S. stock market
activity.

The markets were further impacted after French bank BNP Paribas
SA announced the suspension of three asset-backed securities
funds, saying it could not value them accurately. That sent
stocks lower in Europe and the United States as investors looked
for safer havens such as Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada's statement follows news that the European
Central Bank (ECB) lent nearly euro95 billion (US$130 billion) in
overnight funds to banks at a bargain rate of 4 percent on
Thursday, putting more cash into a global financial system jolted
by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.
