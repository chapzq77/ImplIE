TNK-BP to cut 2009 capital expenditure by a quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian-British oil joint venture TNK-BP said Thursday its
capital expenditure in 2009 would be 3.3 billion dollars,
compared with a figure of 4.4 billion dollars the year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The 2009 Business Plan holds TNK-BP production broadly flat on
2008, with capital expenditure for the year of 3.3 billion
dollars," the company said in a statement after a board of
directors meeting.
</P>
<P>
"In 2009 the company plans to produce 600 million barrels of oil
equivalent for the year," it added. A company spokesperson
confirmed that capital expenditure in 2008 had been 4.4 billion
dollars.

The meeting of the board of directors of TNK-BP Limited -- the
holding company for the TNK-BP group -- came after an accord that
ended months of wrangling between its shareholders over control
of the firm.
</P>
<P>
It said that for the full year 2008 it remained on track to
deliver its best financial performance since the company's
creation despite poor market conditions in the fourth quarter.

<P>
TNK-BP was founded in 2003 and is jointly owned 50 percent by
British energy giant BP and a group of Russian billionaires known
as Alfa Access-Renova (AAR) who include Mikhail Fridman and
Viktor Vekselberg.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month CEO Robert Dudley resigned after Russian
shareholders accused him of acting purely on behalf of BP's
interests and hindering the expansion of the company abroad.
</P>
<P>
Tim Summers had been appointed interim chief executive until a
new appointment is agreed by the shareholders but the statement
said that the nomination of a new permanent CEO was not on the
agenda at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Board also reviewed progress of the top management and
governance transition currently underway inside TNK-BP."
</P>
<P>
"However, there was no discussion or nomination of any individual
candidate as the companyâ€™s next permanent CEO."
</P>
<P>
The Russian press has speculated that the new chief could be the
former chief executive of Norilsk Nickel, Denis Morozov, who is
said to be supported by both groups of shareholders.
