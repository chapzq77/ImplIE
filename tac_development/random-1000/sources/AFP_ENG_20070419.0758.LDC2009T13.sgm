Chinese police have arrested two men who are suspected of
stealing about 50 million yuan (6.6 million dollars) in cash from
the bank were they worked, state media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The men, both in their 30s, worked as tellers in a branch of
Agricultural Bank in north China's Hebei province, the China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Police caught up with one in east China's Jiangsu Province early
Thursday, it said, citing public security ministry spokesman Wu
Heping, while the other had been arrested Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Police have recovered some of the missing funds and are
questioning the men," said Wu, who lamented the ease at which the
men apparently got away with an estimated two tonnes of cash.
</P>
<P>
They were seen fleeing the bank in a van shortly after it was
noticed that the money was missing last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This huge loss of funds has exposed major loopholes in crime
prevention, especially regarding financial institutions," Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
"As the investigation continues, we will learn how the suspects
succeeded, and we will try to mend the holes in our system."
</P>
<P>
Wu said the public had played in crucial role in tracking down
the alleged perpetrators after police offered a reward for
information.
