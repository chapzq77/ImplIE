California's big reds are coming on strong these days as
winemakers pursue riper, fuller-flavored fruit.
</P>
<P>
A number of wines have been creeping past 14 percent alcohol and
even into the 15- to-16 percent range, as opposed to the tamer
12- to 13-percent of years past. This is largely because vintners
wait longer to pick their grapes. More mature fruit is thought to
make tastier wine, but it also means sugar levels have a chance
to rise, which comes with the side effect of pumping up the
alcohol volume. Warmer harvests only increase the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
</P>
<P>
"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of
Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging
consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
</P>
<P>
Darrell Corti, president of Corti Brothers, a Sacramento wine and
food market, is also in the less-is-more camp, announcing last
year his store won't carry table wines over 14.5 percent alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Still, big reds, many of which are highly rated by critics, have
their champions.
</P>
<P>
"They fill your mouth with flavor; you can chew on them. They
linger on your palate when you're drinking them and that's what
Napa is known for -- its big, chewy cabs," said Doug White,
director of operations for the Vintner's Collective, a Napa
tasting room specializing in boutique wineries.
</P>
<P>
For those who don't like the big wines, some have an issue with
the style of higher-alcohol vintages while others are wary of the
punch they can pack.
</P>
<P>
One definition of the "right" alcohol level is if two people can
finish a bottle and "wish there was a little bit more," said
Dunn. "You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent
alcohol wine," he added. "You'd be lying on the floor."
</P>
<P>
It's not always easy to tell just how much alcohol is in a wine.
</P>
<P>
Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled
just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the
alcohol content, under federal regulations. When a percentage is
listed it can be off by up to 1.5 percent, a tolerance granted
because one batch of wine may differ from another, said Art
Resnick, spokesman for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau in Washington, D.C. Wines over 14 percent alcohol, which
fall into a higher tax category, must list alcohol levels with a
tolerance of plus or minus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers
started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the
full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of
enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California
State University, Fresno.
</P>
<P>
California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol
wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as
Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
One way to have ripe fruit without high alcohol is to use various
technologies available to pull alcohol out of wine. But that's
not something many winemakers want to talk about for fear of
crushing the romantic vision of wine as an ancient art untainted
by technology, said Clark Smith, co-owner and senior enologist of
Vinovation, a company in the wine country town of Sebastopol that
reduces alcohol levels through reverse osmosis.
</P>
<P>
The truth is that wine has already been affected by technology,
from stainless steel tanks to sterile filtration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike cooking, where chefs proudly show off new techniques made
possible through innovation, winemaking's become more secretive,
said Smith. "It's a shame," he said, "because winemaking's just
cooking."
</P>
<P>
Vinovation's process works by using powerful filters that remove
alcohol and water from wine. The two are separated by distilling
and the water is then put back into the wine. To arrive at just
how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method
they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is
at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
</P>
<P>
Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too
much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the
winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant
to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't
want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken
back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were
just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the
grower," he said.
</P>
<P>
At Shafer Vineyards, a Napa Valley producer of highly rated reds,
some coming in at 14.9 percent, winery president Doug Shafer
won't use technology to reduce alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"We like our wines. We like the fruit. We like the richness," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shafer is aware of the debate over how much is too much, but says
it's up to consumers to decide what style of wine they prefer.
"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling
everything," he points out.
</P>
<P>
Industry wide, "the quality of wines from around the world just
keep getting better and better," Shafer said. "I think this is
the golden age for the consumer."
