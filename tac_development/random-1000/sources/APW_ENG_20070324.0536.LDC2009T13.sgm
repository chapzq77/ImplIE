University of Florida faculty vote to deny former Gov. Jeb Bush
honorary degree

GAINESVILLE, Florida 2007-03-24 14:20:45 UTC

<P>
University of Florida President Bernie Machen says he was
"tremendously disappointed" with the school's Faculty Senate vote
to deny former Gov. Jeb Bush an honorary degree.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 38-28 Thursday against giving the honorary
degree to Bush, who left office in January.
</P>
<P>
"Jeb Bush has been a great friend of the University of Florida,"
Machen said Friday, adding that the Senate's action is "unheard
of."
</P>
<P>
Some faculty expressed concern about Bush's record in higher
education.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't feel this is a person who has been a supporter of
UF," Kathleen Price, associate dean of library and technology at
the school's Levin College of Law, told The Gainesville Sun after
the vote.
</P>
<P>
Bush's approval of three new medical schools during his tenure
has diluted resources, Price told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bush has also been criticized for his "One Florida" proposal, an
initiative that ended race-based admissions programs at state
universities.
</P>
<P>
Machen maintains, however, that Bush has benefited the
university, such as by providing the funding to attract
nationally recognized faculty.
</P>
<P>
Machen also pointed to Bush's First Generation Scholarship
program, modeled after a University of Florida effort to help
high school students at risk of not making it to college.
</P>
<P>
University officials said they could not recall any precedent for
the Senate rejecting the nominees put forth by the Faculty
Senate's Honorary Degrees, Distinguished Alumnus Awards and
Memorials Committee. The committee determines whether nominees
deserve consideration according to standards that include
"eminent distinction in scholarship or high distinction in public
service."
</P>
<P>
"The committee endorsed him," Machen said. "It is unheard of that
a faculty committee would look at candidates, make
recommendations and then (those candidates) be overturned by the
Senate."
</P>
<P>
An e-mail sent to Bush by The Associated Press was not
immediately returned.
