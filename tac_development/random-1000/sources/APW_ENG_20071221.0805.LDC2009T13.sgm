A nephew of Trevor Berbick has been convicted along with another
man of killing the 54-year-old former heavyweight champion.

A jury Thursday found 21-year-old Harold Berbick guilty of murder
and 19-year-old Kenton Gordon guilty of manslaughter in the death
of the former boxer following a four-week trial.

The judge ordered both men jailed pending their Jan. 11
sentencing.

Authorities said the nephew and Gordon beat Berbick to death in
October, leaving his body in a church courtyard in Portland.
Harold Berbick had been involved in a land dispute with his
uncle.

Trevor Berbick was the last fighter to face Muhammad Ali in the
ring and briefly held the WBC heavyweight title before losing it
to Mike Tyson in 1986.

Berbick fought from 1976-2000, finishing with a record of 50-11
with one draw and 33 knockouts.

Following his retirement from the ring, Berbick was beset by
legal problems, including convictions for sexual assault, grand
theft and burglary, that led to his being deported from the U.S.
back to his native Jamaica.
