The 205 tourists who got sick last week while staying at a four-
star Dominican hotel had caught the virus before arriving on the
island, according to a statement released Tuesday by British and
local health officials.

<P>
The tourists, most of them from the United Kingdom, came down
with a norovirus, which causes gastritis, vomiting, diarrhea and
fever, officials said.

The source of the illness is still unknown. The tourists became
sick shortly after landing on the island; they had not eaten or
drunk anything at the hotel, said Melchor Figueres, viceminister
of public health.

Hotel Bahia Principe San Juan, located on the island's north
coast, reopened after it was temporarily shuttered. The hotel's
food, drinking water and swimming pools had met local safety
regulations, officials have said.
