BELGRADE, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's prime minister-designate Hashim Thaci on Wednesday named
new cabinet members, including Jakup Krasniqi of his Democratic
Party of Kosovo (PDK) as new parliament speaker, the official
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Thaci also named Hajredin Kuqi of the PDK, and Rame Manaj of
coalition partners Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) as his
deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The names of the proposed cabinet will be submitted to the
120-seat Kosovo Parliament for adoption once it reconvenes, about
two months from the PDK's victory in Kosovo's parliamentary
elections on Nov. 17, Thaci said.
</P>
<P>
As the PDK leader, Thaci signed a power-sharing agreement on
Monday to form a coalition with opposition LDK leader, Fatmir
Sejdiu.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the ministries will be distributed as
follows: seven ministers from the PDK, five from the LDK, one
from the Kosovo Turk Democratic Party, while two posts will go to
Serb officials.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has been run by the UN administration since NATO bombing
drove the Serbian forces out of the ethnic Albanian dominated
province in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following failed talks between Belgrade and Pristina on the
future status of the province, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders
have pledged to unilaterally declare independence in early 2008,
but the move is unlikely before Jan. 20, the date for
presidential elections in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The United States and a number of European countries are expected
to recognize Kosovo's independence, but Serbia and its ally
Russia said they would oppose any such move.
