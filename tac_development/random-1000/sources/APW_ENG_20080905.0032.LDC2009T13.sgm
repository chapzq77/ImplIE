Hollywood rings up $4.2B record summer haul

LOS ANGELES 2008-09-05 00:12:14 UTC

<P>
Times may be tough in the real world. Not in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
As it usually does during economic downturns, the movie business
has come on strong, expected to set a summer revenue record of
about $4.2 billion from the first weekend in May through Labor
Day, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers.
</P>
<P>
That would put Hollywood a fraction ahead of the previous record
of $4.18 billion in summer 2007, though accounting for inflation,
the actual number of tickets sold -- about 587 million -- is down
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Still, given the sluggish economy, studio executives are happy
their business held up so well. It's almost a tradition dating
back to the Depression: When the economy goes sour, the escapism
and relative cheapness of a night at the movies is an attractive
prospect for audiences.
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it. It is truly one of the least-expensive ways to
entertain yourself for a few hours," said Rory Bruer, head of
distribution at Sony, whose summer releases included Will Smith's
latest $200 million hit, "Hancock."
</P>
<P>
The behemoth of summer was the Warner Bros. Batman sequel "The
Dark Knight," whose haul -- $500 million and counting -- amounted
to nearly one-eighth of overall Hollywood revenues.
</P>
<P>
"The Dark Knight" passed "Star Wars" to rank No. 2 on the all-
time domestic revenue chart, behind only "Titanic" at $600.8
million.
</P>
<P>
Batman mania already was high as production wrapped last fall,
but it grew to a fever after Heath Ledger, who co-stars as the
Joker, died in January.
</P>
<P>
"We would not be looking at a $4 billion summer if not for `The
Dark Knight,'" said Paul Dergarabedian, Media By Numbers
president. "In this case, one film made a huge difference."
</P>
<P>
"The Dark Knight" and four other superhero tales -- "Hancock,"
Paramount's "Iron Man," and Universal's "The Incredible Hulk" and
"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" -- rang up $1.25 billion, 30
percent of the summer box office.
</P>
<P>
Add in the $315 million take for Paramount's "Indiana Jones and
the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and it's clear that audiences
were looking for pure adventure this summer.
</P>
<P>
On the family front, the animated tales "WALL-E" from Disney and
"Kung Fu Panda" from DreamWorks both topped $200 million. There
was a healthy dose of chick flicks during the male-dominated
summer with Warner's "Sex and the City" and Universal's "Mamma
Mia!" -- both $100 million hits.
</P>
<P>
Raunchy comedy also packed in crowds with the R-rated hits
"Tropic Thunder" from Paramount and "Step Brothers" and
"Pineapple Express," both from Sony.
</P>
<P>
Some major flops accompanied the successes. Eddie Murphy bombed
with his sci-fi comedy "Meet Dave" from 20th Century Fox, as did
Mike Myers with Paramount's comedy "The Love Guru."
</P>
<P>
Warner's family-action tale "Speed Racer" and 20th Century Fox's
sci-fi sequel "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" also crashed and
burned.
</P>
<P>
Yet most big studio films delivered, finding both commercial
success and better-than-usual reaction from critics, who
typically tear many summer blockbusters to shreds. "The Dark
Knight" and "Iron Man" earned some of the best reviews ever for
summer popcorn flicks, the acclaim helping to keep the theaters
packed.
</P>
<P>
"It's the old story," said Dan Fellman, head of distribution at
Warner Bros. "Give the people what they want and they'll come out
in big numbers."
