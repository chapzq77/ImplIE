UN official says Myanmar is forcing cyclone survivors out of
refugee camps
</HEADLINE>

YANGON, Myanmar 2008-05-31 01:58:55 UTC
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups lashed out at Myanmar's military leaders for
evicting cyclone refugees from relief camps and forcing them back
to their isolated, storm-shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone
survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their
devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a release Saturday that
hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people had also been
expelled from schools, monasteries and public buildings. In
Yangon, there were eyewitness reports of one eviction from a
Christian church.
</P>
<P>
Another group, Refugees International, said authorities appear to
be trying to get villagers back to their land to begin tending
their fields and reviving agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home
without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with
assistance," it said.
</P>
<P>
Eight camps set up for homeless survivors in the Irrawaddy delta
town of Bogalay were "totally empty" as the clear-out continued,
said Teh Tai Ring of the United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF
-- at a meeting of U.N. and private aid agency workers discussing
water and sanitation issues.
</P>
<P>
"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding
that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location
of the villages, basically with nothing."
</P>
<P>
After his statement was reported, UNICEF issued a statement
saying the remarks referred to "unconfirmed reports by relief
workers on the relocation of displaced people affected by" the
May 2-3 storm.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said
the information came from a relief worker who had just returned
from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he
recounted his findings earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Separately, at a church in Yangon, more than 400 cyclone victims
from a delta township, Labutta, were evicted Friday following
orders from authorities a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
"It was a scene of sadness, despair and pain," said a church
official at the Yangon Karen Baptist Home Missions in Yangon,
speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisal.
"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the
whole village was washed away. They have no home to go back to."
</P>
<P>
All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young
children and those with severe illnesses left the church in
eleven trucks Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The authorities told church workers that the victims would first
be taken to a government camp in Myaung Mya -- a mostly undamaged
town in the Irrawaddy delta -- but it was not immediately clear
when they would be resettled in their villages.
</P>
<P>
Aid groups meanwhile said Myanmar's military government was
hindering foreign assistance for victims of the cyclone, despite
a promise to U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon to ease travel
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the
government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the
Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
They said the International Red Cross was waiting for permission
to send 30 foreign staffers into the delta.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2.4 million people remain homeless and hungry after
the May 2-3 cyclone hit Myanmar, also known as Burma. Myanmar's
government says the cyclone killed 78,000 people and left another
56,000 missing.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations
and then they are forced to move." But others were being denied
such aid because they had lost their government identity cards,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps
and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier
declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it
was time for "reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid experts disagree, arguing that many people are still
in need of emergency assistance for food and shelter, as well as
medical care.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers who have reached some of the remote villages say
little remains that could sustain the former residents. Houses
are destroyed, livestock have perished and food stocks have
virtually run out. Medicines are nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
"The forced evictions are part of government efforts to
demonstrate that the emergency relief period is over and that the
affected population is capable of rebuilding their lives without
foreign assistance," Human Rights Watch said.
