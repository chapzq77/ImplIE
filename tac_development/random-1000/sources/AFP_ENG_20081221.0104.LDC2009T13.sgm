Israel threatens major offensive against Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel threatened on Sunday to launch a major offensive against
the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip as violence simmered around the
impoverished territory days after the end of a truce with the
Islamists.
</P>
<P>
The two frontrunners in the race to become prime minister after a
snap election in February both vowed to topple Hamas, which has
run Gaza since violently seizing power there in June 2007.
</P>
<P>
Militant rocket and mortar fire continued on Sunday, the Israeli
army said, reporting that one person was slightly wounded. A
Palestinian medic said a woman had been injured in northern Gaza
by shrapnel from a tank shell but the military denied firing in
the area.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must topple the Hamas rule in Gaza and a government under
my command will do just that," Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni,
leader of the governing Kadima party, was quoted as saying by
Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must react when it is fired upon, must re-establish its
force of dissuasion and stop the rockets."
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the right-wing Likud party
which is leading in opinion polls, echoed the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, we have no choice but to topple Hamas rule," he
was quoted as saying by the Ynet news website as he toured the
southern Israeli town of Sderot, which has borne the brunt of
militant rocket attacks from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have to go from passive response to active
assault."
</P>
<P>
Senior defence officials said after the weekly cabinet meeting
that Israel was preparing to take action to halt the rocket
strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing our response to the Hamas threat, with the
decision yet to be taken on the timing and the scale," Amos
Gilad, a senior adviser to Defence Minister Ehud Barak, told
public radio.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli defence official told AFP that a major military
confrontation in the besieged territory was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious where we are heading in Gaza. The situation is
intolerable but clear. The army's considerations are the only
thing that is deciding when events will unfold," the official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
In Beit Hanun in the northern Gaza Strip, a Palestinian woman in
her 40s was wounded by shrapnel from a tank shell on Sunday, a
Palestinian medic said, but the Israeli army denied opening fire
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar
shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some
damage.
</P>
<P>
The armed wing of the radical Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, which is loosely linked to the Fatah movement of
president Mahmud Abbas, claimed it was behind the rockets.
</P>
<P>
Tensions around Gaza have risen steadily since Friday, when Hamas
said it would not renew a six-month truce with Israel that came
into effect in June after months of Egyptian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Gaza militants have launched several dozen rockets,
causing some damage and slightly wounding a handful of civilians,
and Israel has retaliated with air strikes, killing one militant
and several other Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although several Israeli ministers have for weeks been calling
for the army to oust the Islamist masters of Gaza, observers say
the government is wary of launching a major offensive less than
two months before the election for fear it would not be able to
score a decisive victory.
</P>
<P>
"The politicians aren't in any rush to reach election day with an
incomplete military operation and only partial results hanging
around their necks," wrote military analyst Alex Fishman in top-
selling daily Yediot Aharonot.
</P>
<P>
"And worse than that, to be accused of having ordered a military
operation just to improve their chances at the ballot box," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel responded to violence that erupted around Gaza in early
November by tightening its blockade of the territory and halting
deliveries of humanitarian aid and other basic supplies.
</P>
<P>
The over-crowded and aid-dependent land of some 1.5 million
people has been subject to an Israeli blockade and repeated raids
since 2006, when Hamas won Palestinian elections and later joined
in a deadly cross-border raid which saw militants capture an
Israeli soldier who remains hostage to this day.
