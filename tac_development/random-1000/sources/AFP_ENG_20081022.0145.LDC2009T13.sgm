Iceland's biggest bank Kaupthing formally nationalised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The domestic assets in what used to be Iceland's biggest bank
Kaupthing have been transferred to a new bank controlled by the
Icelandic state, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The FME has now decided to transfer a part of Kaupthing's
operations to a new bank that has been formed and is fully owned
by the Icelandic government," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The decision ensures continued banking operations for Icelandic
families and businesses," it said.
</P>
<P>
With its announcement, the FME made clear the new bank, called
New Kaupthing, would take over all the old bank's domestic
assets, while its international operations had been separated to
be sold off.
</P>
<P>
The government announced that it was taking control of Kaupthing
on October 9 -- after also taking over the second and third
biggest banks Landsbanki and Glitnir -- following the collapse of
Iceland's financial sector due to a liquidity shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to the FME, the new bank's equity will be 75 billion
kronur (500 million euros, 641 million dollars) and the size of
its balance sheet 700 billion kronur.
</P>
<P>
The authority had announced a similar procedure for Glitnir last
week.
