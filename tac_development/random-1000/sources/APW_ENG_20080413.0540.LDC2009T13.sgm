MILAN, Italy 2008-04-13 15:42:29 UTC

AS Roma scored three second-half goals Sunday to rally for a 3-1
victory at Udinese and put pressure on Serie A leader Inter
Milan.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Di Natale put Udinese ahead in the 52th minute, before
Mirko Vucinic equalized in the 64th. Rodrigo Taddei then scored
the winner for Roma in the 70th and Ludovic Giuly added an
insurance goal in the 90th.
</P>
<P>
The win gives Roma 71 points, one behind Inter which played
Fiorentina later Sunday. Juventus is third with 61 followed by
Fiorentina at 56.
</P>
<P>
"The question about whether things are still open depends on what
Inter does," said Roma coach Luciano Spalletti. "We have to try
not to make any mistakes in these last games."
</P>
<P>
There are five games left on the season with Roma having a
slightly easier schedule than Inter.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other games, it was: Empoli 1, Parma 1; Genoa 3,
Torino 0; Lazio 1, Siena 1; Livorno 1, Cagliari 2; Napoli 2,
Atalanta 0; and Reggina 1, Sampdoria 0.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Juventus rallied for a 3-2 win against AC Milan and
Palermo defeated Catania 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Roma rebounded from its midweek 1-0 loss to Manchester United in
the Champions League quarterfinals, which eliminated the Italian
club 3-0 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Roma captain Francesco Totti returned following a two-week
absence due to an injury, which caused him to miss both games
against United. Totti looked rusty, missing several good scoring
chances and was substituted in the 76th.
</P>
<P>
Both teams started the game at a furious pace, creating several
scoring opportunities. Taddei saved a shot from Udinese striker
Fabio Quagliarella on the goal-line in the 33rd, and Totti came
close on a free kick as time expired in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Before the victory over Udinese, Roma had managed just one win in
its previous five away games.
</P>
<P>
The goals by Vucinic, Taddei and Giuly were the sixth of the
Serie A season for each player.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the first time we come back for a win and that's a sign
of a great team," said Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi.
</P>
<P>
In Genoa, Marco Borriello scored his league-leading 19th goal in
Genoa's 3-0 win over visiting Torino.
</P>
<P>
Reggina moved out of last place with its 1-0 victory over
visiting Sampdoria, which had won five of its last six games and
is sixth in the league.
</P>
<P>
In the late game, Fiorentina's attacking duo of Adrian Mutu and
Giampaolo Pazzini, who have combined for 25 Serie A goals this
season, will be looking to break through Inter's injury-depleted
defense.
</P>
<P>
Striker Mario Balotelli, who scored his first goal in Serie A
last weekend, will get his second straight start for Inter as
Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to be sidelined with an injury.
