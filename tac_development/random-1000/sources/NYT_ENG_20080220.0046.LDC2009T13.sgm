JUSTICES MAKE IT TOUGHER TO SUE OVER FDA-APPROVED DEVICES
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the manufacturer of a
federally approved medical device cannot be sued under state law
if the device causes an injury. By 8-1, the court ruled in favor
of Medtronic, the Minneapolis-based maker of a balloon catheter
that burst and severely injured Charles R. Riegel while he was
undergoing an angioplasty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Riegel and his wife, Donna, sued the company in federal court,
contending that the catheter had been designed, labeled and
manufactured in a way that violated state law, and that those
defects had caused severe and permanent injuries to Riegel.
</P>
<P>
But a federal district court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Manhattan, dismissed the Riegels' suit on the ground
that the catheter had been given pre-market approval by the Food
and Drug Administration, thus protecting the manufacturer from
liability under state law.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal courts on Wednesday,
with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority that
Medtronic and other manufacturers were protected under the
Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre-
emption bars states from imposing on medical devices "any
requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any
requirement applicable under this chapter."
</P>
<P>
But the justices' ruling was hardly the last word on when FDA
approval bars patients from suing. They are already considering
at least three cases involving drugs and drug-labeling.
</P>
<P>
Scalia wrote that the FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours
reviewing each device application and grants pre-market approval
only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of its "safety
and effectiveness."
</P>
<P>
"It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they
nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available
alternatives," Scalia wrote, noting that the FDA approved a
ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts "even
though the survival rate of children using the device was less
than 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
The majority was apparently persuaded by Theodore B. Olson, the
lawyer for Medtronics, who argued before the justices on Dec. 4
that the FDA and not the courts was the right forum for imposing
requirements on cutting-edge medical devices. Arguing that
"nothing is perfectly safe," Olson argued that it would harm
patients and future patients to "discourage the marketing of
products that might save our lives."
</P>
<P>
Medtronic, one of the world's largest manufacturers of
cardiovascular devices, no longer makes the type of catheter used
on Riegel, who died several years after the operation.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter on Wednesday,
asserting that the majority had adopted an unnecessary
"constriction of state authority." Ginsburg said she did not
believe that Congress had intended to bring about "a radical
curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for
injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical
devices."
</P>
<P>
In this case, the Bush administration had taken the side of the
medical-device industry, arguing argued that there would be
"serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its
balancing of the risks and benefits" if juries could second-guess
the agency.
</P>
<P>
Allison M. Zieve, the lawyer for Donna Riegel, expressed her
disappointment to Bloomberg News. "Pretty bad for patients,
pretty good for industry profits," she said.
