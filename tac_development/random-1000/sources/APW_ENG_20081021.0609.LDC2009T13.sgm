its third-quarter profit increased 3 percent on higher
international sales led by growing demand from Latin America. the
conglomerate trimmed its 2008 earnings forecast.

The Maplewood, Minnesota-based company said net income edged
higher to $991 million, or $1.41 per share, from $960 million, or
$1.32 per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, 3M would
have earned $999 million, or $1.42 per share, in the latest
period.

Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 6.2 percent to
$6.56 billion, boosted by 26 percent sales growth in Latin
America.

of $1.38 per share, though revenue was slightly shy of their
$6.65 billion estimate, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.

3M, which has broad exposure to the U.S. economy, touted its
diversified businesses as its key advantage over competitors.

many economic storms and to also take advantage of opportunities
when our competitors could not," said George Buckley, 3M
chairman, president and CEO, in a statement.

Sales in Europe and Canada gained 8 percent and 9 percent,
respectively, while revenue in the Asia Pacific region fell 1
percent. The dollar's weakness against other major currencies

economic conditions remain volatile," Buckley said.
