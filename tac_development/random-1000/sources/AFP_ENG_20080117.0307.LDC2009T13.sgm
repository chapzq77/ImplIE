Russian president-to-be toughens his act in one-horse race
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bounding round a building site, questioning local officials and
issuing the odd cutting reprimand, Dmitry Medvedev, the man
tipped to be Russia's next leader, is sharpening his act ahead of
a March 2 election.
</P>
<P>
While there is no sign of serious competition in the polls, the
Kremlin is hard at work turning this previously low profile
bureaucrat into someone closer in style to his long-time
supremely confident mentor, incumbent President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
A visit this week to the oil-rich Tyumen region in western
Siberia was the latest tightly choreographed opportunity for the
42-year-old former law professor to show he has what it takes to
head the world's largest country.
</P>
<P>
With television cameras carefully positioned along his route,
Medvedev listened earnestly and interjected with questions as he
toured a development of starter apartments being built for young
families, complete with playgrounds and sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow insists the elections will be fair. But critics charge
that the opposition has been marginalised by biased media
coverage and the use of state resources to promote the Kremlin's
candidate.
</P>
<P>
A few strains showed through on Wednesday's tour, as when two
workmen admitted to nervousness while "painting" and "repainting"
a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
In fact their brushes were completely dry -- to avoid splashing
the guests, they explained.
</P>
<P>
"How's the work going?" asked the dark-suited Medvedev,
lightening up somewhat. "Are you being paid correctly?.... So.
Everything's alright."
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been working for some time on ensuring a seamless
transition after eight years under Putin, who is however expected
to retain power in a job as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev currently holds the post of first deputy prime minister,
in which he has been responsible for the touchstone issues of
housing, health and education.
</P>
<P>
Since Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last month,
Medvedev's tours around the country to inspect such projects and
meet residents have stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Along the way he has toughened his speaking style and has even on
occasion adopted Putin's habit of dressing all in black, a look
that works to underline the current Russian leader's hard-man
image.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev occasionally encounters complaints, such as when a
building site worker told him of his worries about the cost of
education and housing.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev responded that the state would maintain the current
number of subsidised higher education places and urged the young
man to work hard.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with regional governors he went on to emulate
Putin's habit of reeling off statistics, taking copious notes,
making cutting interjections and at one point rebuking an
enthusiastic governor.
</P>
<P>
Only on February 2, one month before voting, is the election
campaign to be officially declared open.
</P>
<P>
At that point other candidates are due to be given a chance to
appear in the media, with slots to broadcast what usually turn
out to be stilted campaign advertisements.
</P>
<P>
But by then the whole thing may effectively be over.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December a poll by the independent Levada research
centre suggested Medvedev was headed for 79 percent of the vote.
