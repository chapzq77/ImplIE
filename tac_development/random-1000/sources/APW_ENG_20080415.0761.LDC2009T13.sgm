Czech police say hundreds of bronze plaques have been stolen from
a Holocaust memorial in a Jewish cemetery near Prague.
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Alena Romova says 327 plaques with names of
the dead were taken last week from the state-sponsored
Theresienstadt memorial.

<P>
There have been no indications that the theft had an anti-Semitic
motivation. Romova said Tuesday the plaques may have been stolen
for resale as raw bronze.

<P>
The damage is estimated at about 1 million koruna (euro40,000;
US$63,640).
