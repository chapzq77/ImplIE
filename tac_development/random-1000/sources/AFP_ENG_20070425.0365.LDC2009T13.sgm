Head start: Scientists crack beer-froth enigma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is the nagging question of whether life exists other than
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
The enduring mystery of who made us -- and why.
</P>
<P>
And then there is this: Why does the foam on a pint of lager
quickly disappear but the head on a pint of Guinness linger?
</P>
<P>
Answers to questions 1 and 2 are still being sought, but the
Great Beer Riddle, at least, may soon be solved.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the prestigious British science journal Nature, an
elite scientific duo say they have devised an equation to
describe beer froth.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough will not only settle the vexatious lager vs.
stout debate, it will also help the quest to pour a perfect pint
every time.
</P>
<P>
Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces. In other
words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled
bubbles separated by liquid.
</P>
<P>
The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension --
and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of
the bubbles. As a result of this movement, the bubbles merge and
the structure "coarsens," meaning that the foam settles and
eventually disappears.
</P>
<P>
Three-dimensional equations to calculate the movement have been
made by Robert MacPherson, a mathematician at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and David Srolovitz, a
physicist at Yeshiva University, New York.
</P>
<P>
They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who
in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.
</P>
<P>
The mathematics of beer-bubble behaviour are similar to the
granular structure in metals and ceramics, so the equation also
has an outlet in metallurgy and manufacturing as well as in pubs.
