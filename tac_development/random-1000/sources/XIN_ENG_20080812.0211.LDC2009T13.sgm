The strike by baggage handlers at the Brussels International
Airport entered its second day Tuesday. Scores of arriving and
departing flights have again been cancelled or delayed.

The airport in the Belgian capital continues to be a scene of
thousands of stranded travelers, heaps of luggage and signs
listing scores of delayed, diverted or cancelled flights, Belgian
broadcaster VRT reported.

The baggage handlers are protesting against high work pressure.
They say tasks that used to be carried out by five people now
have to be done by only three.

The management of baggage handling company Aviapartner has
offered a second proposal on improvement of working conditions to
the workers and it again was rejected by the trade unions.
However, the unions have agreed to hold a referendum among the
workers on the proposal Tuesday afternoon.

At Flightcare, another baggage handling company, the negotiations
between the management and labor collapsed last night.

Some airlines have been transporting their passengers by bus to
other airports nearby. And some travel agencies have rearranged
for their charter flights to depart from the city of Liege in
eastern Belgium.

Airport officials said that after the strike ends it could take
days to process the backlog of luggage.
