Taipei, Sept. 21 (CNA) 09/21/07  19:38:04 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
A probe into alleged misappropriation of "special allowance fund"
by four heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) during their services in the government and Judicial Yuan
President Weng Yueh-sheng will soon conclude, the Supreme
Prosecutors Office (SPO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yun-nan, director of the SPO's Special Investigation Task
Force, was responding to reports by the United Daily News that
the unit's probe into use of the fund by the four DPP bigwigs --
Vice President Annette Lu, DPP presidential candidate and former
Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP vice presidential candidate and former
Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman and former Premier Yu Shyi-
kun -- are drawing to an end.
</P>
<P>
As Weng's term will expire at the end of the month, the probe is
also expected to end soon, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that when the probe will conclude is not yet certain,
although the time will come soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said that the SPO
Special Investigation Task Force should step up its probe into
suspected irregularities in the use of the "special allowance
fund" by former senior government officials of the opposition
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wang Sing-nan said the DPP filed a complaint with the
special investigation unit in May over suspected irregularities
in the use of special allowance fund by 97 central and local
government officials under the previous KMT administration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPP's stance has been that if the four DPP
heavyweights are found to have lined their pockets with the
"special allowance fund, they should be dealt with according to
the law."
</P>
<P>
But the special investigation unit should pay equal attention to
the use of the fund by former Vice President Lien Chan, KMT vice
presidential candidate and former Premier Vincent Siew, KMT
Chairman and former Minister of the Interior Wu Poh-hsiung and
KMT Secretary-General and former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, so
as to convince the public of their impartiality.
</P>
<P>
All executives  holding public office are given a special
allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent
without any proof of spending, while use of the other half must
be substantiated with receipts.
</P>
<P>
The issue of "special allowance fund" use drew widespread
attention after an investigation into the alleged misuse of such
a fund by Ma Ying-jeou, KMT presidential candidate, last August
when DPP Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni complained that Ma had
channeled money from the fund into his private bank accounts
during his two terms as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the fund triggered a hot debate after Ma contended
that he had no intention of breaking the law because he
considered that the fund had been set aside for his discretionary
use as "private money, " just as it is regarded by every other
recipient of similar funds in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted in February for embezzling NT$11.17 million
(US$338,500) from the "special allowance fund." He was acquitted
of graft in the first trial Aug. 14. Prosecutors have appealed
the verdict.
