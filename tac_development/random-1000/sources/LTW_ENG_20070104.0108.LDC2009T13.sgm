WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is not a large man, standing
perhaps 5 feet 3 inches tall in thick soles. But he packed a
whole lot of chutzpah when he walked into the House TV gallery
Wednesday to demand that the new Democratic majority give the new
Republican minority all the rights that Republicans had denied
Democrats for years.
</P>
<P>
``The bill we offer today, the minority bill of rights, is
crafted based on the exact text that then-Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi submitted in 2004 to then-Speaker of the House Dennis
Hastert,'' declared McHenry, 31, with 10 Republican colleagues
arrayed around him. ``We're submitting this minority bill of
rights, which will ensure that all sides are protected, that
fairness and openness is in fact granted by the new majority.''
</P>
<P>
Omitted from the McHenry plea for fairness was the fact that the
GOP had ignored Pelosi's 2004 request -- while routinely engaging
in the procedural maneuvers that Pelosi's plan would have
corrected. Was the gentleman from North Carolina asking Democrats
to do as he says, not as he did?
</P>
<P>
``Look, I'm a junior member,'' young McHenry protested. ``I'm not
beholden to what former congresses did.''
</P>
<P>
Anne Kornblut of the New York Times asked McHenry if his
complaint might come across as whining.
</P>
<P>
``I'm not whining,'' he whined.
</P>
<P>
Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when
the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the
Democrats' heavy-handed leadership. But Republicans expecting
Democrats to rule the House with an iron fist are likely to be
pleasantly surprised: The incoming majority was having enough
trouble keeping its own supporters in line.
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leaders were giving their first news conference
of the year when the session in the Cannon building was hijacked
by Cindy Sheehan and other antiwar demonstrators, some wearing
tie-dyed apparel and pins linking President Bush to Adolf Hitler.
Just after Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., vowed, ``We're gonna cut
the interest rate in half for student loans,'' hecklers began to
chant ``De-escalate! Investigate! Troops home now!''
</P>
<P>
``That is exactly what we're talking about,'' Emanuel said,
trying to appease the protesters. But the hecklers kept chanting,
and he fled.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic leaders in retreat, Sheehan seized the microphone.
``We put them back in power,'' she said of the Democrats. Passing
out a printout calling for defunding the Iraq war, Sheehan
shouted: ``These are our demands. And they're not requests --
they're demands.''
</P>
<P>
If Wednesday was any indication, the 110th Congress will be
highly entertaining, if not terribly productive. So far, it's
hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic
leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
</P>
<P>
The day began when House Republican Conference Chairman Adam
Putnam of Florida led fellow House GOP leaders to a news
conference in a Capitol basement hall. At 32, he is a year older
than McHenry, and several inches taller, but no less outraged by
Democrats' refusal to bestow on Republicans the rights that
Republicans refused to bestow on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was
covered with a layer of makeup.
</P>
<P>
``We're clearly disappointed,'' seconded Roy Blunt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
``I'm disappointed, as are some others,'' added Kay Granger of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
</P>
<P>
It fell to CNN's Dana Bash to point out the awkward truth. ``You
can play back, almost verbatim, Democrats ... saying almost
exactly what you all just said,'' she said. ``So is there a
little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority
rights?''
</P>
<P>
``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the
House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign
promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were
still in the majority?'' inquired Rick Klein of the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
``Well, I'll let Chairman Dreier speak to that,'' Putnam
ventured.
</P>
<P>
Republicans must have known they'd have some explaining to do,
because they scheduled back-to-back news conferences on their
minority rights. As soon as the Putnam session ended, Granger
took the elevator up three flights and joined McHenry and his
cohort in the TV gallery.
</P>
<P>
Granger had not updated her talking points. ``It's very
disappointing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited
the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously
sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights. McHenry
unfurled excuses: ``We were not in Congress. ... I didn't have
the opportunity. ... She did not put it in legislative form.''
</P>
<P>
It had all the makings of a PR debacle. Fortunately for McHenry,
the Democrats were otherwise engaged. An hour after fleeing the
microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other
Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about
ethics and the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
``Rahm, would you answer Cindy Sheehan, though?''
</P>
<P>
``An hour or so ago you had to stop your remarks because (of)
Cindy Sheehan.''
</P>
<P>
``What are Democrats going to do about the war in Iraq?''
</P>
<P>
For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.
