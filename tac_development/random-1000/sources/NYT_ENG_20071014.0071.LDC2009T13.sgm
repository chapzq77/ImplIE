GORDON TAKES CONTROL OF PLAYOFF RACE

CONCORD, N.C.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gordon has little to prove in a career that has left him
among the best drivers to have ever competed in NASCAR. He has
four Cup championships, and his legacy is already secure.
</P>
<P>
That does not stop him from pushing for more.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that says I need to do this or I need to do
that, or I haven't done this and so this is what's left," Gordon
said Thursday as he prepared for the Bank of America 500 at
Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night. "I'm just trying to be
competitive and continue to get that great feeling of what it's
like to win races and battle for championships and hope that
we've got what it takes to do it."
</P>
<P>
So far, he still does. Gordon survived a shocking end to
Saturday's race, losing the lead as his car sputtered, only to
hang on after the leader Ryan Newman crashed with three laps to
go in regulation. In a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish,
Gordon then held off Clint Bowyer to take the checkered flag for
his second consecutive victory. He also took control of the
playoff chase. He has a 68-point lead on his teammate Jimmie
Johnson, who finished 14th, and a 78-point on Bowyer, who
finished second as he continues to assert himself in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
With five races to go in the Chase, they are the only three
drivers with a realistic shot at winning the title.
</P>
<P>
Gordon came into the race in a slump at Lowe's, having failed to
finish each of his last five races here dating back to 2005. In
the meantime, Johnson came into the race with five victories at
Lowe's and an air of invincibility here. But Johnson experienced
a rare spin-out with 104 laps to go and fell to 30th, before
climbing back.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we were looking for, getting a win at Charlotte,"
Gordon said as he celebrated in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
In the final laps, Gordon had a comfortable lead on Kyle Busch,
his Hendrick Motorsports teammate when the race was red-flagged
for a little more than 12 minutes after a late crash left oil on
the track. That gave Busch an opening on a restart. But he was
instructed by the team owner, Rick Hendrick, not to wreck Gordon,
and Busch agreed. But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled
into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the
playoff chase into a one-man race. He dominated through the first
200 laps of the event. But a long stay on pit road to replace a
part dropped him down to 16th place with just over 120 laps to
go. Johnson appeared on his way up the field when he spun out. He
moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with
five laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who won his first title last year, can become the first
driver since Gordon to win back-to-back championships in the Cup
series since Gordon pulled off that feat in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
It appears the two-time champion Tony Stewart will not be a
threat. He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until
crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey
Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of
the race. Stewart's No. 20 Chevrolet sustained damage on the
right front and he dropped back to 28th. Although Stewart
finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.
