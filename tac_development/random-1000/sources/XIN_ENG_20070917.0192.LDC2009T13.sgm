PLO urges U.S. to adopt explicit stance before Middle East peace
conference

RAMALLAH, Sept. 17 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
A member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Monday
urged the U.S. administration, in particular U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice, to be clear in its political stance
before the Middle East peace conference slated for November.
</P>
<P>
"The political stances of the U.S. administration in general, and
its Secretary of State in special, as well as the similar
attitudes of the Israeli government decrease the creditability of
the U.S. administration," said Taysser Khaled, member of the
PLO's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
"Those U.S. administration's policies seem to be maneuvers rather
than a political initiative aimed at calming down the Arabic
conditions," Khaled added.
</P>
<P>
Rice is slated to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on
Thursday to discuss preparations for November conference which
will probe ways of resuming Israeli-Palestinian political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the conference will be "meaningless" should either
there is not a real political process or the Arab nations did not
involve in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The PLO, Syria and Lebanon must be part of the conference,"
Khaled put it explicitly.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Egypt and Jordan, who are set to join the
conference, not to take part in if a breakthrough, i.e. Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, was not
certain.
