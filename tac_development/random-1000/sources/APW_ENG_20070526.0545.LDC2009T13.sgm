Zimbabwe opposition party says police arrest 200 supporters

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 2007-05-26 15:52:36 UTC

Riot police in Zimbabwe Saturday raided the headquarters of the
main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), arresting
dozens of supporters, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Chamisa said "close to 200" MDC supporters had been seized
in the raid on the party's headquarters in central Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said in a telephone interview that three truckloads of riot
police arrived at the headquarters around midday. The police
broke up a "routine meeting" called by the MDC to discuss party
issues ahead of next year's crucial presidential and
parliamentary polls, Chamisa added.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word from the government.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe's government embarked on a fierce
clampdown on the opposition in March, worried that Zimbabwe's
fast-deteriorating economic crisis could spark an uprising.
</P>
<P>
Since then hundreds of opposition party supporters have been
arrested and dozens beaten, including main opposition leader
Morgan Tsvangirai. Most recently, police arrested and assaulted
defense lawyers acting on behalf of opposition members.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki is heading an initiative to
bring the Mugabe government and the opposition to the negotiating
table, but there have been few signs of success so far.
</P>
<P>
Chamisa said many of those arrested in Saturday's raid were
members of the youth wing.
</P>
<P>
"This is hypocrisy by this regime," he said. "This is a selective
application of what they call the law."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week police in Harare extended a controversial ban
on demonstrations and rallies for one month, citing fears of
political violence.
</P>
<P>
But Saturday's meeting "was neither a demonstration nor a rally,"
Chamisa said.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried for the safety" of those arrested, he said. At
least 12 opposition supporters arrested in a similar raid on the
party's headquarters in March are still in custody, accused of
planning acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are rising in Zimbabwe, where inflation last month
reached a record 3,714 percent. Teachers and civil servants are
threatening strikes in a move likely to anger the authorities.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the deputy information minister was forced to issue an
official denial that Zimbabwe's soldiers were starving following
claims in a local weekly that the army was fast running out of
food and might have to suspend training of recruits.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe insists Zimbabwe's worst-ever economic crisis is a result
of Western sanctions and has nothing to do with a seven-year-old
program of white land seizures that has seen agricultural
production in this once-prosperous nation plummet.
</P>
<P>
Government officials routinely tell Zimbabweans that the MDC is
responsible for the sanctions and urge them to vote for the
ruling party in upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The MDC and other government critics have been calling for the
repeal of controversial legislation including tough security and
press laws.
</P>
<P>
But National Security Minister Didymus Mutasa has ruled out a
repeal of the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), the official
Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mutasa said the act which has been used to ban public meetings
was "vital in checking Western-sponsored pandemonium in the
country," the Herald said.
