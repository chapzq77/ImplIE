Iran will use force to defend nuclear drive: Ahmadinejad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Friday that his
country will use force against its "enemies" to defend its
nuclear drive, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
"For them, subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts. The key
reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years
against Iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can
say we have given in," Ahmadinejad said.
</P>
<P>
"But the Iranian people will resist with force against the
enemies," state television quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The comments came as the United States on Friday set a weekend
deadline for Iran to respond to an international offer to freeze
its nuclear drive.
</P>
<P>
"We want and we expect a response this weekend," US State
Department acting spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
But an EU diplomat said in Brussels that the European Union is in
no rush for a response from Iran.
</P>
<P>
"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of
anonymity after Washington set the deadline. "We're in no rush"
to have a response "in the next 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Thursday that
there was no deadline and that his country had already replied.
</P>
<P>
Iran on July 4 handed major powers what it said was its
"constructive and creative" response to their offer presented by
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in June aimed at persuading
Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear work.
</P>
<P>
The package, drawn up by the five permanent members of the UN
Security Council plus Germany, offers Tehran technology and
negotiations if it suspends uranium enrichment which the West
fears could be used to make atomic weapons.
