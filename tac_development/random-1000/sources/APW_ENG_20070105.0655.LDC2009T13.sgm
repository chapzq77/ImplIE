Ancient Roman road found in Netherlands

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-01-05 12:38:04 UTC
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists in the Netherlands have uncovered what they
believe is part of the military road that marked the northern
boundary of the Roman Empire from the middle of the first century
A.D.
</P>
<P>
Train company Prorail made the initial discovery during
preparations to add extra rail lines in the city of Houten, 10
kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
"It's in very good condition," said Houten city spokeswoman
Marloes van Kessel.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists and Prorail will complete an excavation of a short
stretch in the coming weeks, and carry out exploratory digs to
determine the further route of the road, the city said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Excavations of parts of the road, known as the "limes," are
ongoing in other European countries and the U.N. is considering
declaring it a world heritage site.
</P>
<P>
Only traces of the Dutch road, which generally followed branches
of the Rhine river east to Germany, have been preserved.
</P>
<P>
Although the limes' course is known from ancient maps,
archaeologists have been unable to locate it south of Utrecht and
the stretch found in Houten is believed to have connected two
forts: Fectio, modern Vechten, and Traiectum, modern Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
Romans first entered this part of the Netherlands under Julius
Caesar in the year 53 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Fectio was established around 9 A.D., but Utrecht was not built
until 47 A.D., as Romans fought German tribes for control of the
area, including trade on the river -- and built full-fledged
roads, good for rapid movement of troops.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have yet to determine a date for the road, which
the city said is built on a sloping mound of sand and clay,
interspersed with layers of gravel. It was flanked by drainage
channels and has wooden poles for reinforcement. Pottery shards
were used as filler material in several places, which should aid
in dating.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is the latest of several in the area of Utrecht. In
2002, archaeologists found the remains of a watchtower on the
Rhine where detachments of three or four soldiers would have
served as lookouts.
</P>
<P>
Near the tower, they found bones and other remains of food the
soldiers ate and such objects as a spearpoint, a coin, an ax, a
sickle and an ancient pen.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, archaeologists excavated a 25-meter long barge, complete
with a covered living cabin and decorated chest with lock and key
-- which led to the suggestion it may have been used by a
paymaster to sail upriver carrying supplies to military camps and
bases.
</P>
<P>
Among the items found with the wreck were numerous leather shoe
soles, complete with studded bottoms for extra strength; a knife,
a saw; a wooden shovel; shears; a copper pot; clay cups and pots;
a paddle with traces of blue paint; an iron crowbar, and a piece
of wood with Roman numbers on it.
