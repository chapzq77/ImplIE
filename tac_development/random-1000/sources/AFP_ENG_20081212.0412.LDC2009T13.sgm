SAfrica's ANC loses court battle over breakaway party name
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South African court Friday rejected the ruling party's legal
challenge to the name of a breakaway faction, clearing a hurdle
for defectors from the African National Congress to form a new
party.
</P>
<P>
The new party will name itself the Congress of the People, which
was also the name of a meeting in 1955 when anti-apartheid
activists laid out the defining principles of their movement in a
document known as the Freedom Charter.
</P>
<P>
"We are now going forward with the launch and the registration of
the party using our name. Nothing is stopping us," breakaway
leader Mbazima Shilowa told private Radio 702.
</P>
<P>
He described the court ruling as a major victory ahead of the
party's official launch on Tuesday at a conference in
Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, which has dominated South African politics since
apartheid ended, vowed to appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress of the People of 1955 was a watershed moment in the
history of our struggle, and should stand as a monument to the
determination of the South African people to be free," ANC
spokeswoman Jessie Duarte said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC does not believe that this name should be appropriated
for the exclusive use of any political party, particularly one
that had no involvement in that historic event," said Duarte.
</P>
<P>
The splinter group was formed in November by ANC dissidents loyal
to former president Thabo Mbeki who was recalled by the party as
head of state in September.
</P>
<P>
The court case had prevented the party from registering for the
next year's general elections. It was not immediately clear if an
ANC appeal could hold up the party's registration.
