Jordan Staal scored a power-play goal in the second period and
Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury made 26 saves, giving the
Penguins a 2-0 victory Sunday over New York Rangers and a home-
ice sweep of the first two games of their second-round NHL
playoff series.

Staal's goal came with older brother Marc, a Rangers defenseman
on the ice, and was all the offensive support Fleury needed.
Fleury helped the Penguins kill off two key Rangers power plays
in the final six-plus minutes and Adam Hall scored into an empty
net with 16.7 seconds remaining.

Games 3 and 4 will be Tuesday and Thursday nights in New York
City's Madison Square Garden, where Pittsburgh is winless in four
games this season.
