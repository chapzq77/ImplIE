The Website of Bolivia's state news agency ABI was shut down
Tuesday by a malicious hacker, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
In addition to launching a "denial of service" attack, the hacker
also replaced the Website's normal front page with vandalized
images of President Evo Morales, and of Vice President Alvaro
Garcia.

<P>
Gason Nunez, director general of Bolivia's National Public
Relations Directorate, described the attack as yet another
interference with ABI work.

<P>
"We believe this is another way of attacking the news. We in
government will not tolerate this and will assume a position on
the matter in coming hours," he added.
