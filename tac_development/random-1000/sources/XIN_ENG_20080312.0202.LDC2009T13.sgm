Poor population in the United States is constantly increasing.
According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in
August 2007, the official poverty rate in 2006 was 12.3 percent.
There were 36.5 million people, or 7.7 million families living in
poverty in 2006. In another word, almost one out of eight
American citizens lives in poverty. The poverty rate in
Mississippi was as high as 21.1 percent (Poverty Drops as
Nation's Income Hits 5-years High, USA Today, August 29, 2007).
The poverty rate of major American cities was 16.1 percent. The
rate was 15.2 percent in suburban areas and 13.8 percent in the
South. The poverty rate in the Washington D.C. was 19.8 percent,
which meant nearly one-fifths of its citizens were living in
poverty (DC's "Two Economies" Headed in Different Directions,
Report Finds, DC Fiscal Policy Institute, October 24, 2007).

The wealth of the richest group in the United States has rapidly
expanded in recent year, widening the earning gap between the
rich and the poor. The earnings of the highest one percent of the
population accounted for 21.2 percent of American total national
income in 2005, compared with 19 percent in 2004. The earnings of
the lowest 50 percent of the population accounted for 12.8
percent of the total national income in 2005, down from 13.4
percent in 2004 (Reuters, October 12, 2007). The number of
"ultra-high-net worth" U.S. households, that is, those with a net
worth of 5 million U.S. Dollars or more, excluding the value of
their primary homes, reached 1.14 million in 2006, a 23 percent
rise from 930,000 in 2005 (Richest Households Pass 1 Million
Mark, CNNmoney.com, April 17, 2007). The number of billionaires
increased from 13 in 1985 to more than 1,000 in 2006 (The
Observer, July 24, 2007). Top executives of major U.S. businesses
made an average of more than 10 million U.S. Dollars in 2006, 364
times over that of ordinary workers. They earn as much money in
one day of work as ordinary workers make over the entire year
(AFP, January 4, 2008).  (more)
