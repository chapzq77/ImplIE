CIA REPORT DETAILS MISSTEPS BEFORE SEPT. 11 ATTACKS (SUBS FOR
REWRITING THROUGHOUT.) DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
A report released Tuesday by the Central Intelligence Agency
includes new details of the agency's missteps prior to the Sept.
11 attacks, outlining what the report says were failures to grasp
the role being played by the terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed and to fully assess the threats streaming into the spy
agency during the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 19-page report, prepared by the agency's inspector general,
also says that between 50 and 60 CIA officers knew of
intelligence reports in 2000 that two of the Sept. 11 hijackers,
Nawaf al-Hamzi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, may have been in the United
States. But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI
about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence
of what it calls a systemic failure.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general recommended that several top agency
officials, including former director George J. Tenet, be held
accountable for their failure to implement a strategy to
dismantle al-Qaida in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks. Gen.
Michael V. Hayden, the current CIA director, and his predecessor,
Porter J. Goss, have declined to seek disciplinary action against
Tenet and others named in the report.
</P>
<P>
The basic outlines of the report have been known since shortly
after it was completed in 2005, but it had never been made
public, and its release reignited a debate about whether the CIA
should have done more before the attacks, and whether Tenet and
other officials should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
Tenet called many of the report's conclusions "flat wrong," and
Hayden noted that many of those criticized in the review by the
agency's inspector general probe have criticized the "focus,
methodology and conclusions" of the report.
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the
spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before
the Sept. 11 attacks. The summary of the report was released at
the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the
terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
The bitter dispute surrounding the report's release suggests the
depth of anger that remains, nearly six years after the fact,
over where blame should be assigned for the intelligence failures
surrounding Sept. 11. Among the lawmakers who voiced renewed
anger at the CIA's decision not to discipline anyone was Rep.
Rush D. Holt, D-N.J., a member of the House intelligence
committee.
</P>
<P>
"Accountability is a concept the American people understand,"
Holt said in a statement, adding: "I am stunned that Gen. Hayden
still does not get that message."
</P>
<P>
Many of the report's findings about bureaucratic breakdowns that
allowed the 19 hijackers to elude authorities and carry out the
attacks have been documented elsewhere, principally by the Sept.
11 Commission, but the report by John Helgerson, the CIA
inspector, was the first to recommend that top CIA officials face
a disciplinary review.
</P>
<P>
The full report by the inspector general, totaling several
hundred pages, remains classified. As spelled out in the
executive summary that was released on Tuesday, the report found
neither "a single point of failure" nor a "silver bullet" that
would have allowed the CIA to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. It
found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of
their errors amount to misconduct.
</P>
<P>
But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to
counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were
redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the
agency's clandestine service. It cited "failures to implement and
manage important processes, to follow through with operations and
to properly share and analyze critical data."
</P>
<P>
The report does not cite the names of the officials who it says
"did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory
manner," but it identifies some of them by their titles. Besides
Tenet, the probe criticizes James L. Pavitt, the CIA's former
deputy director for operations; J. Cofer Black, the former
director of the agency's Counterterrorist Center; and other top
CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability
board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in
October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and
who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence
breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers
about taking risks."
</P>
<P>
The report cited the CIA's failure to pass intelligence about al-
Mihdhar and al-Hamzi to other agencies as potentially
significant. The CIA had identified the two men in January 2000
when they visited Malaysia, but never notified the State
Department to put them on the terrorist watch list.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general report said some 50 to 60 CIA officials
knew of the intelligence about the two men, a higher number than
had been previously reported, and that persistent surveillance of
them "had the potential to yield information on flight training,
financing and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11
attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's
efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure,
and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms
during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida. In
his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that
the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust
plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before
Sept. 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Without such an effort, we would not have been able to give the
president a plan on Sept. 15, 2001, that led to the routing of
the Taliban, chasing al-Qaida from its Afghan sanctuary and
combating terrorists across 92 countries," Tenet said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what
it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and
the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden. It
said the standoff had prevented CIA officials from gaining access
to transcripts of intercepted communications between terrorism
suspects, and criticized Tenet for not interceding to resolve
these turf battles.
</P>
<P>
In describing the period prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, the
report said the CIA had carried out "no comprehensive analysis
that put into context the threats received in the spring and
summer of 2001." It said that the principal responsibility for
Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned
to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror
suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing
threats.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to
allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United
States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
</P>
<P>
In a note to agency employees on Tuesday, Hayden made it clear
that he continued to oppose the report's release.
</P>
<P>
"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting
ground that is already well plowed," he said. But Philip Zelikow,
the executive director of the Sept. 11 commission, praised the
CIA report and said that it was broadly consistent with the
findings of his panel.
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed at how brutal and unforgiving they were on their
own senior management, which I thought spoke very well of the
institution," Zelikow said.
</P>
<P>
Both Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes,
D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence
committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had
corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.
