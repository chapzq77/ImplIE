The United States returned the tattooed head of a Maori and bones
from 13 others to New Zealand on Monday -- the latest
repatriation of indigenous remains from overseas museums, a Maori
expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The ancestors were welcomed back on to Te Papa's marae (National
Museum meeting place)" and placed in a sacred area with scores of
other returned remains, said Arapata Hakiwai, director of Maori
treasures at Wellington's Te Papa National Museum.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Maori tribes took part in the early morning
ceremony, along with staff from Chicago's Field Museum, the
donor, and American Indian First Nation tribal members.

<P>
"For all of us a very emotional time to be returning at last the
(remains) to New Zealand," Field Museum Curator of Pacific
anthropology John Terrell told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago museum bought the bones in 1893 from a scientific
supply house in New York. Researchers once used them to compare
the features of different native peoples.
</P>
<P>
Hakiwai, one of the group that accompanied the remains from the
Field Museum, said the museum had "made the right decision on the
right grounds -- it was the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
The Field Museum one of the first major U.S. museums to return
Maori remains, which will now be part of ongoing research to try
to determine which tribal area they originated from in the 19th
century. They were collected when Maoris offered mummified heads
and other remains of mainly slaves in grisly exchanges for guns
and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Hakiwai said his museum had acquired repatriated Maori remains
from more than 30 institutions worldwide since 2003.
</P>
<P>
The museum in Chicago also has a 125-year-old carved Maori
meeting house acquired in 1919, and Terrell said museum officials
would meet with Maori leaders to discuss how best to help it
function as a multicultural meeting place for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Several other U.S. museums still hold Maori heads and bones,
including the American Museum of Natural History, which has some
35 severed Maori heads.
