Romania and Uruguay want to develop and diversify their

Basescu made the remark when receiving the visiting parliamentary

During the talks, the two voiced a common will of development and
diversification of the bilateral cooperation, noting the
important role played in this respect by the common Latin roots

Presidential Administration.

They voiced hope that the relations between the two countries
will be boosted, in the economy first, where the level of
cooperation is under the real potential, with Romania's EU
accession being thought to be an element of support of the
Romanian-Uruguayan cooperation, the release said.
