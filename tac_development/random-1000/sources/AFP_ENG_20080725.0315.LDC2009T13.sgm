Karadzic was 'like a saint,' female assistant says
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radovan Karadzic was a "saint" who only ever performed good
deeds, the former wartime Bosnian Serb leader's female assistant
told an Italian newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who faces trial by a UN tribunal for genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity, was arrested in Belgrade on
Monday, having evaded capture for more than a decade whilst using
a fake identity.
</P>
<P>
Mila Damianov, a Belgrade native who says she met Karadzic under
his assumed name Dragan Dabic at an alternative health seminar in
late 2007, denied that their relationship went beyond a
professional interest.
</P>
<P>
"I was not his fiancee, I was his assistant, but also his pupil,"
she told La Repubblica. "When I heard the news, I thought it must
have been a mistake, and I'm still having difficulty believing it
now.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry at him. For me, he remains an exceptional person.
Personally, I've only seen Doctor Dabic do good. I don't like to
judge other people."
</P>
<P>
She added: "We met about seven or eight months ago during an
alternative medicine seminar in Belgrade. Dabic was very
competent in his field, which fascinated me."
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was caring for an autistic child. I asked him if I
could become his assistant and he accepted. Thanks to the energy
he put into it, this child has made enormous progress."
</P>
<P>
"I never doubted his identity," she told the newspaper. "I saw
him like a saint, an apostle for those who are suffering."
</P>
<P>
"He never spoke of politics. I asked him a few questions about
his past, but all he told me was that he had been married, that
he had children and grand- children."
</P>
<P>
Asked if she wanted to see Karadzic again, Damianov replied:
"Yes, certainly. Why not?"
</P>
<P>
One of the world's most wanted men, the wartime Bosnian Serb
leader vanished the year after the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted him in 1995, when the
war in Bosnia was halted.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, 63, is accused of orchestrating two of Europe's worst
atrocities since World War II --the 44-month siege of Sarajevo
which killed more than 10,000 people and the Srebrenica massacre
of around 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
</P>
<P>
He has been indicted for genocide, complicity in genocide,
extermination, murder, wilful killing, persecutions, deportation
and inhumane acts against Muslims, Croats and other non-Serb
civilians during Bosnia's war.
