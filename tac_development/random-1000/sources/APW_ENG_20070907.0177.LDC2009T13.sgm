Bin Laden plans new video in advance of Sept. 11 anniversary;
first video in 3 years

CAIRO, Egypt 2007-09-07 01:21:47 UTC

<P>
Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead
of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be
the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three
years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11
anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information
warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Still, bin Laden's appearance would be significant. The al-Qaida
leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004,
and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his
longest period without a message.
</P>
<P>
One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious. The
announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin
Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black. In his past
videos, bin Laden's beard was almost entirely gray with dark
streaks.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice
among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE
Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror
messages.
</P>
<P>
"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks
young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on
an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al-
Sahab, frequently posts messages.
</P>
<P>
"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin
Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al-
Sahab. Such announcements are usually put out one to three days
before the video is posted on the Web.
</P>
<P>
IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror
threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours,
before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide
hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida
-- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout
itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued
survival.
</P>
<P>
"They've always gone out of their way to commemorate it," said
Ben Venzke, chief executive officer of IntelCenter. "Historically
the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks. It's
drawn to video releases."
</P>
<P>
But the fact that bin Laden is delivering the message is
significant, he said. Whether the message will indicate a
potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
</P>
<P>
Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said he could not confirm
the existence of a tape, "and there is no credible information at
this time warning of an imminent threat to the homeland." But he
said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants
in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country
is currently in a period of increased risk.
</P>
<P>
The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would
only underscore the threat the United States and other nations
face from extremists.
</P>
<P>
"Six years after 9/11, the arrests in Germany and Denmark this
week and the battles we fight against al-Qaida in Iraq,
Afghanistan, southeast Asia and around the world remind us of the
continuing threat we face from extremists and why we must
continue to take the fight to them wherever they are," said
Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first
images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the
U.S. presidential elections. In that appearance three years ago,
he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it
stopped threatening Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has
gone without releasing a message. His last audiotape was on July
1, 2006, in which he welcomed new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq
succeeding the slain Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from
Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006. That absence sparked widespread
speculation he was ill, wounded or possibly dead.
</P>
<P>
There has been little such speculation since then. U.S. officials
have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida
leader is alive. He is thought to be hiding in the tribal regions
of western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During bin Laden's silence, his deputy Egyptian-born Ayman al-
Zawahri has been frequently issuing videos and audiotapes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawahri appeared in a 2006 video marking the 9-11 anniversary.
An anniversary video in 2003 showed footage of bin Laden and al-
Zawahri walking through mountain paths, with voice-over messages
from both leaders.
