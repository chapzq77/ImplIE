Peter Fulton has been elevated to the opening slot vacated by the
injured Lou Vincent as New Zealand seeks a quick solution ahead
of Thursday's Super 8s game against the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said Tuesday that Fulton was
his choice for an opening partner in the team's first Super 8s
outing after a long break, while the West Indies will be turning
out to play for the third successive day after its game against
Australia went into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The West Indies-Australia match was disrupted by showers after
the Australian innings of 322 for six, leaving the West Indies
batsmen to start their chase Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Peter's been in outstanding form," said Fleming, referring to
the batsman who came to the World Cup with half-centuries in
three of his last four innings, but missed out on some
preliminary round matches.
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredibly difficult decision to leave Peter out of
the first few games," said Fleming. "He's now getting a bat in
one position for a while."
</P>
<P>
In his previous 29 one-dayers, the 28-year-old Fulton's position
kept switching between No.3 and No.4.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's team management had earlier considered wicketkeeper
Brendon McCullum to fill in the opening vacancy in place of
Vincent who Monday flew back home after fracturing his left wrist
during a training session.
</P>
<P>
McCullum had been tried as an opener by New Zealand, but then
shifted back to the middle order where he had more success with
the bat.
</P>
<P>
Vincent's replacement in the squad will be Hamish Marshall, who
was permitted by the International Cricket Council's technical
committee to fill in for Vincent.
</P>
<P>
This is the second replacement in New Zealand's original World
Cup squad, within days of Chris Martin replacing injured Daryl
Tuffey.
</P>
<P>
Fleming said the squad's balance had changed with these injuries.
"But the core is still there," he said.
