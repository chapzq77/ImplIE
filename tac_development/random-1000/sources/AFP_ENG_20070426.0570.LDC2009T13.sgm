Tennis: Nadal's clay streak stretches to 69 wins by Scott
Williams

Rafael Nadal extended his record run on clay to 69 straight wins
as he moved a step closer to a title hat-trick at the Barcelona
Open on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish top seed beat former Australian Open champion Thomas
Johansson 6-1, 6-4, but not without a spirited comeback from the
Swede in a combative second set of the third-round contest.
</P>
<P>
Nadal said he is under no pressure when he plays, but knows that
his charmed life cannot go on forever.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about the record when I'm on the court," said the
double Roland Garros winner. "I only concentrate on the match.
</P>
<P>
"The opponent also deserves respect. I know that I will lose
sometime."
</P>
<P>
After riding roughshod over the number 73 Johansson in a
21-minute opener, Nadal looked like having things all his own
way.
</P>
<P>
But Johansson, 32, showed nerve as he re-discovered his survival
instincts to turn the second into a struggle at the Real club.
</P>
<P>
Johansson fired six aces and held serve in a marathon sixth game
featuring eight deuces.
</P>
<P>
But Nadal had the last word in front of his home public, breaking
for victory in the final game after Johansson followed an ace
with a run of errors.
</P>
<P>
It took Nadal appropiately 69 minutes to go through.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard is bidding to collect a hat-trick of Barcelona
titles, aiming to become the second man after Swede Mats Wilander
(1982-1984) to win the event three times on the trot.
</P>
<P>
"I controlled the game in the first set but he played well in the
second," said the winner. "I tried not to let up after winning
the first easily.
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable to win 69 on clay and it's especially nice to
play here, where I have so much support."
</P>
<P>
Nadal improved his Barcelona career record to 13-1, his lone loss
coming in 2003 when he was beaten as a teenager in the second
round by Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
He next faces Italian surprise packet Potito Starace, the number
72 who beat Argentine eighth seed Juan Chela 6-4, 7-6 (12-10) in
their third-round encounter on a fifth match point.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed David Ferrer flew the flag for Spain as he hammered
Serb Boris Pashanski 6-2, 7-5. But there was a home loss as
Argentine Agustin Calleri upset number three and 2006 finalist
Tommy Robredo 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Nikolay Davydenko won a momentum-shifting match over
Filippo Volandri, coming from 2-5 down in the second-set tie-
breaker.
</P>
<P>
Number four David Nalbandian out out Spanish 16th seed Carlos
Moya 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Unknown Spaniard Oscar Hernandez, who has played just eight
career matches off of the clay, upset sixth seed Jarkko Nieminen
6-1, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 with the frustrated Finn missing on 17 or 19
break chances, including six in the marathon final game.
