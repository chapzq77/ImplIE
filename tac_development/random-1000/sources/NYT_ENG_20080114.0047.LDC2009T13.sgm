GETTING CLUED IN TO DETECTIVE ' S APPEAL

Why is it they make movies out of crummy '70s television series
("Starsky and Hutch," "Charlie's Angels,") but not good '70s
television series? Yes, there were some - and not only sitcoms.
Where, for example, is the movie version of "The Rockford Files"?

Jim Rockford very much belongs in the great, shaggy tradition of
the LA detective. Philip Marlowe is only the most famous (James
Garner, who played Rockford, took a swing at Raymond Chandler's
creation in a 1969 film version of "The Little Sister"). There's
also J.J. Gittes, Lew Archer, Joe Friday, Easy Rawlins. In fact,
Easy Rockford might be a more suitable name for Garner's
character. Rockford has a relaxed unflappability that's a major
factor in the show's appeal. Rockford's personality also owes
something to Elliott Gould's take on Marlowe, in Robert Altman's
"The Long Goodbye" - though the Malibu where Rockford parks his
trailer is a lot different from the one Gould's Marlowe contends
with.

"The Rockford Files": Season Five consists of 20 episodes on five
discs, with no extras. Well, Rockford always was a no-frills sort
of guy - except for that answering machine which opened each
episode. Even if he didn't get much respect on the air, he did
offscreen. Season five saw the show win an Emmy for outstanding
drama. It also looks ahead to another Emmy winner. "Sopranos"
creator David Chase wrote the scripts for four episodes during
the '78-'79 season, including a memorable two-parter, "Black
Mirror."

How much you want to bet that if he was stuck inside on a Friday
night the teenage Tony Soprano was watching "Rockford"?
