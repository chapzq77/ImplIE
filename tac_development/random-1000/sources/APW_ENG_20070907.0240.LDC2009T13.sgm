A man trying to call a news station to complain about not being
provided a trailer after Hurricane Katrina two years ago
accidentally dialed a police hot line and was charged with making
methamphetamine after officers arrived, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Curtiss Randall Coleman was trying to get the number for Biloxi's
WLOX-TV on Wednesday just before the 6 p.m. newscast,
investigators said. He misdialed when trying to reach directory
information, which is 411. He called 911, the emergency services
number.
</P>
<P>
When he hung up on the emergency dispatcher, the Jackson County
Sheriff's Department was sent to the home to see if anyone was in
need of assistance.
</P>
<P>
Deputies said that when they arrived at Coleman's house, no one
answered the door. Officers broke in and allegedly found a
methamphetamine lab.
</P>
<P>
Coleman, 53, and four others were arrested, including Coleman's
son, Christopher, 30. A fifth suspect remains at large.
</P>
<P>
"It was a calamity of errors on Mr. Coleman's part," said Sgt.
Curtis Spears, commander of the Narcotics Task Force of Jackson
County.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Colemans, narcotics agents also arrested Erin
Paula Oliver, 35, of Moss Point, and Leslie Renee McMahon, 27, of
Ocean Springs. All four were charged with conspiracy to
manufacture meth.
</P>
<P>
A person who answered the phone at the Jackson County jail
declined to say whether Coleman and the others had attorneys.
