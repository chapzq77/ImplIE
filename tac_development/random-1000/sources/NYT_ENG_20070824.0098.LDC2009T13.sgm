NO CHECKS FOR BOMBS IN CERTIFIED AIR CARGO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo
packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes
without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law
requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny
as checked suitcases.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, President Bush signed a bill into law that
requires some type of inspection of all freight carried on
passenger planes. The airline industry had fought such a
requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in
getting the legislation blocked. But in late July, Democrats
passed the measure.
</P>
<P>
The new law was celebrated as a victory by pilot and flight
attendant unions, as well as its main congressional champion,
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Malden. Markey put a
video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website,
proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his
fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger
planes."
</P>
<P>
But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given
three years under the law to develop a full inspection program,
says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by
government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
TSA spokesman Christopher White said freight "is inherently
screened" if it is packed with tamper-evident seals at a facility
that meets federal security standards.
</P>
<P>
Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that
under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by
hand, just like bags checked by passengers. They said the Bush
administration's decision to implement the new law with a
"certified shippers" program is only a slight improvement over
the current system, which allows cargo from "known shippers" to
be loaded directly onto passenger planes. The only difference is
that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not
have to meet security standards.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, the TSA is working to circumvent what we want and what
we feel is the best type of security," said Captain Paul Onorato,
president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations. "The
((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines
up on the deck where they run it through. That's what we want"
for cargo.
</P>
<P>
Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the
TSA's procedures are finalized. But the early signs, he said,
show that "it will be necessary to very closely monitor how this
law is implemented."
</P>
<P>
"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline
industry would even think that they could get away with anything
less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto
passenger planes," Markey said.
</P>
<P>
Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all
cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes. He
has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press
conferences, and issued 17 news releases. He is known for using
props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline
cargo.
</P>
<P>
But the passenger airline industry had stoutly resisted any such
requirement, saying it would cause delays that could jeopardize
$4.3 billion per year in cargo business for air carriers.
</P>
<P>
The airline industry has also long insisted that machines do not
exist that can screen certain densely-packed cargo boxes. But
Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have
been tested at several airports. The company that makes the
machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without
unpacking them.
</P>
<P>
Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had
been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and
Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to
enact a law requiring such screening. Immediately after Democrats
won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline
industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill
passed.
</P>
<P>
"If you have 100 percent physical inspection of cargo, you are
basically going to shut that part of the economy down," said Jim
May, president of the Air Transport Association, days after the
election.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed Markey's
proposal as part of the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation
Act, which Bush signed Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system
that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the
level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags"
within three years. Many supporters of the bill assumed that
meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be
screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either
X-rayed or physically inspected.
</P>
<P>
The statute says the TSA must require more than a simple check of
a shipment's paperwork against a database of registered shippers.
The law requires that if such data checks are used, they must be
paired with a physical check or screening method approved by the
TSA.
</P>
<P>
The statute does not require the screening to be performed on the
airport premises or specify any screening method, but lists
several examples of methods that would suffice, including X-ray
machines, explosive detection systems, bomb-sniffing dogs, and a
physical search.
</P>
<P>
But White, the TSA spokesman, said the agency believes the law
will be satisfied merely if cargo comes from a "certified"
facility, one that meets certain security standards. He said the
agency is also considering whether to require tamper-evident
seals on cargo shipments. Together, such precautions would be
good enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline
industry, declined to comment on the new screening law. Instead,
it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by
its president when Congress passed the bill. At the time, May
praised the law though he had previously spent years saying
Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a
multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for
enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
</P>
<P>
Shane Larson, the government affairs director for the Association
of Flight Attendants, said it sounded as if the TSA and the
airline carriers had agreed to interpret the law in a way that
would allow for minimal changes, contrary to "what we believe is
the intent of the law."
</P>
<P>
Markey said he is willing to give the TSA a chance to demonstrate
that a "pack and seal approach" could really achieve the same
level of security screening for bombs that checked luggage
receives at airports, but expressed doubts.
</P>
<P>
If Congress decides that the final regulations for freight
security are not truly "commensurate" with the level of security
that checked bags receive, Markey said, he and other lawmakers
will seek to change them.
</P>
<P>
"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures
that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement
that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually
screened for bombs," Markey said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Bush administration tries to bend the law, it is going to
discover that there is a new sheriff in town."
