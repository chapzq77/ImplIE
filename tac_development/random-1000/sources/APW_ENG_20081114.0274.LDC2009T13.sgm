APNewsBreak: Met Opera to cut `Ghosts '
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 2008-11-14 04:43:44 UTC
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Opera is giving up "The Ghosts."
</P>
<P>
Cutting costs in the wake of the economic downturn, the Met is
dropping next season's highly anticipated revival of John
Corigliano's "The Ghosts of Versailles" that was to feature the
company debut of Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.
</P>
<P>
Angela Gheorghiu and Thomas Hampson, who also were to appear,
instead will sing in a less-costly revival of Verdi's "La
Traviata," Met general manager Peter Gelb said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In looking at ways to economize, that was an unfortunate
sacrifice," Gelb said in a telephone interview. "It's a much more
expensive revival than most."
</P>
<P>
Gelb said all eight new productions will proceed as planned, but
that some revivals may be replaced with less expensive ones.
"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in
March 2010. Cutting it will save more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
"If you look around at all the opera houses and what's happening,
it's obvious that this is a time of crisis. Peter is just doing
what he can to save the company," Corigliano said. "Times have
changed from the past in terms of grand opera. In this country,
at least, it's certainly boning down."
</P>
<P>
Gelb had been a big proponent of increasing the Met's
presentations of works by living composers.
</P>
<P>
"We will plan to put it in on at another time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chenoweth was understanding.
</P>
<P>
"Kristin is, of course, disappointed, as she was very excited to
work with John Corigliano," spokeswoman Jill Fritzo said. "She
has a great deal of respect for Peter Gelb and understands the
steps that need to be taken during this economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Gelb hopes to find another opera for the Tony Award-winning
Chenoweth, an opera-trained soprano, but nothing has been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
"As we are examining the cost of running the Met season with an
ever-increasingly careful eye toward saving costs, we're looking
at the running costs of certain revivals compared to others,"
Gelb said. "It will involve the shifting of some repertoire."
</P>
<P>
He was not prepared to announce other shifts in revivals because
discussions with the singers are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Met, the largest musical institution in the
United States, is the most high-profile evidence of the profound
changes the economy is causing in the arts world. The Washington
National Opera announced this week that it is postponing next
season's presentation of Wagner's four-opera "Der Ring des
Nibelungen," which had been planned since 2001.
</P>
<P>
The company said that while it anticipated sellouts, "even the
strongest ticket sales cover only a fraction of production
expenses and the opera must look to the generosity of
individuals, foundations and corporations to support its work."
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic changes in the nation's economy have made all of us
who are responsible for WNO's welfare reluctantly come to the
difficult decision to postpone the Ring Cycle until the financial
climate becomes more positive," general director Placido Domingo
said.
</P>
<P>
Opera Pacific in Santa Ana, California, last week canceled its
remaining productions this season, Ricky Ian Gordon's "The Grapes
of Wrath" and Strauss' "Salome," according to a recording on the
company's main telephone number. There is a chance Opera Pacific
will close for good.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Mortier, who was to take over as general manager and
artistic director of the New York City Opera next season, quit
last Friday because the company failed to raise enough money to
pay for his plans.
</P>
<P>
Change has been less drastic at the Met. Next season is the first
completely planned by Gelb, and the eight new productions are the
Met's most since 1966-67, its initial season at Lincoln Center.
Gelb responded to inquiries about the change in plans a day after
the Web site Opera Chic said the Met intended to cut four
unspecified productions from next season's schedule.
</P>
<P>
Gelb said that when this season opened late September, the box
office had been 2 percent ahead of the 2007-08 season, when
prices were essentially the same. Now, the season-to-season
comparison is even.
</P>
<P>
"We're experiencing fluctuations at the box office," he said.
"Things are less predictable than they were last season."
</P>
<P>
In other Met news, Gelb said the company will soon release its
first self-produced DVD, the English-language version of Julie
Taymor's production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute." Previous Met
releases have been issued by commercial recording companies.
