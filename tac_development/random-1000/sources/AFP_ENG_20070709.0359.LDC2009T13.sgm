Queen will not be questioned in Diana inquest: British judge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip will not be
approached by officials investigating princess Diana's 1997 death
in a Paris car crash, a British coroner said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mansfield, lawyer for Mohammed Al-Fayed, father of
Diana's boyfriend Dodi who also died in the smash, wanted the
monarch to agree to be "a potential witness" and her husband to
"answer inquiries."
</P>
<P>
But the senior judge leading the inquest, Lord Justice Scott
Baker, said this would not be "appropriate or necessary" at the
moment, while pledging to keep the position "under review."
</P>
<P>
Fayed believes that Diana was pregnant with his son's child when
she died on August 31, 1997 and that they were murdered in a plot
masterminded by Philip.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges came at the latest preliminary hearing at London's
High Court ahead of a long-delayed inquest which is expected
finally to get under way in October.
</P>
<P>
Under British law, inquests are only used to establish basic
facts about a death and cannot determine blame or liability.
</P>
<P>
Mansfield said he wanted the monarch to be questioned about an
alleged conversation when she allegedly warned former royal
butler Paul Burrell of "other forces or powers at work within the
state."
</P>
<P>
It also emerged at Monday's hearing that a note sent to Burrell
by Diana, in which she claimed that her then husband, Prince
Charles, "is planning an accident in my car," had been secured
for use at the inquest.
</P>
<P>
The next pre-inquest hearing is due to take place on July 27.
</P>
<P>
A report on the crash by Lord John Stevens, the former head of
London's Metropolitan Police, last December found it was an
accident.
</P>
<P>
It added that the couple's chauffeur, Henri Paul, was well over
the legal alcohol limit for driving and was speeding.
