Damaged space shuttle Endeavour lands in Florida after drama-
filled mission
</HEADLINE>

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 2007-08-21 17:10:33 UTC

Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a
nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in
the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
The space shuttle swooped out of the partly cloudy sky and
touched down on the runway at 12:32 p.m. (1632 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations. Welcome home. You've given a new meaning to
higher education," Mission Control told commander Scott Kelly and
his crew, which included teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan.
</P>
<P>
The main concern for much of the mission was the gouge to
Endeavour's protective tiles. NASA did not want the shuttle to
suffer any structural damage that, while not catastrophic, might
require lengthy postflight repairs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days and right up until landing, NASA had
stressed that the 3 1/2-inch-long 3.5 (8.9-centimeter-long) gouge
in Endeavour's belly would not endanger the shuttle during its
landing. In 2003, a damaged wing on shuttle Columbia had allowed
hot gases to seep in during the re-entry, tearing the shuttle
apart.
</P>
<P>
There was zero chance of a Columbia-style catastrophe this time,
NASA managers insisted, although they acknowledged re-entry was
always risky.
</P>
<P>
The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures
during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers
were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that
the spacecraft would hold up.
</P>
<P>
With its pilots reporting no problems, Endeavour zoomed over the
South Pacific, crossed Central America and Cuba, then headed up
the Florida peninsula into Kennedy Space Center. Its trip spanned
13 days and 5.3 million miles (8.53 million kilometers).
</P>
<P>
The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over
the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station
visit short because of Hurricane Dean. At the time, NASA was
uncertain if Dean would veer toward Texas and threaten Houston,
home to Mission Control. Even though forecasters later put
Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.
</P>
<P>
During Endeavour's liftoff on Aug. 8, a piece of foam insulation
or ice had broken off a bracket on the external fuel tank, fell
onto a strut lower on the tank and then bounced into the shuttle,
gashing its tiles.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts inspected the especially vulnerable areas Sunday,
after undocking from the international space station. NASA on
Monday cleared Endeavour for landing after engineers finished
evaluating the latest laser images of the shuttle's wings and
nose and concluded there were no holes or cracks from
micrometeorites or space junk.
</P>
<P>
Brackets have shed debris in launches since Columbia, but it was
not until Endeavour's flight that such debris caused noticeable
damage again. The damage triggered a weeklong analyses that
involved hundreds of engineers and thousands of hours of
supercomputer simulations.
</P>
<P>
NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the
problem is solved. For now, Discovery is supposed to lift off in
late October.
</P>
<P>
While in orbit, the astronauts attached a new truss segment to
the space station and replaced a failed gyroscope needed for
keeping the outpost headed in the right direction. They also
delivered 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of supplies.
</P>
<P>
The crew completed four spacewalks, two of which were cut short.
One was halted after a spacewalking astronaut noticed a cut in
his glove. The other was abbreviated to give the crew enough time
to prepare for an early departure from the space station.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the crew includes pilot Charles Hobaugh and mission
specialists Alvin Drew, Tracy Caldwell, Dave Williams and Rick
Mastracchio.
