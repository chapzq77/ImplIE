US negotiator to visit Pyongyang this week: state dept
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US envoy Christopher Hill will travel to Pyongyang later this
week to try to revive flagging negotiations aimed at North
Korea's nuclear disarmament, a State Department spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy spokesman Robert Wood said Hill's trip -- which includes
stops in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo -- was part of effort "to get
the process back on track."
</P>
<P>
He will leave later Monday for Seoul, where he is to due to hold
talks Tuesday with South Korean counterpart Kim Sook, Wood said.
He will then travel to Pyongyang, though the exact date was not
yet available.

<P>
"We're very concerned about some of the reversal of disablement
activities that the North has been engaged in," Wood told
reporters during the daily briefing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"And he (Hill) obviously wants to consult with his counterparts
in the region out there to see what our next steps are going to
be with regard to a response to what the North is doing," Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, will be "in the region looking for ways to work with our
allies to bring North Korea into compliance with its
obligations."
</P>
<P>
Under the six-country pact, North Korea agreed to disable and
dismantle key nuclear facilities and allow UN atomic inspectors
to return, in return for one million tonnes of fuel aid and its
removal from a US list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
But North Korea announced last month it had halted the process in
protest at Washington's refusal to drop it from the US blacklist
of countries supporting terrorism, as had been promised.
</P>
<P>
Washington says the North must first accept strict outside
verification of the nuclear inventory that Pyongyang handed over
in June.
