New York food establishments wage endless war against rodents

NEW YORK 2007-02-25 01:19:04 UTC

<P>
When a pack of rats invaded a fast food restaurant here, many
people were shocked as they watched widely distributed video
footage of the dozen twitchy rodents scampering across the
eatery's floor.
</P>
<P>
But in a city like New York, businesses that handle food wage a
seemingly endless battle against vermin. The difference with the
rats caught on tape this week at a joint KFC and Taco Bell
restaurant? Patrons usually do not see the creatures and
certainly not in such large numbers.
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing knowing it. It's another seeing it," said Nicole
West, 23, who lives near the restaurant, which was shut down
Friday and remained closed.
</P>
<P>
Trouble with mice, rats, cockroaches and other pests are not
limited to restaurants. State sanitary reports show scores of
small markets and prominent area grocery stores have at one point
or another dealt with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
"The city is a tough place," Jeffrey Eisenberg, president of Pest
Away Exterminating in Manhattan, said in a recent interview.
"It's a battle. If you look, you're gonna find them."
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, rodents gnaw their way into sacks of
cat and dog food, pasta and beef packages and loaves of bread.
Mice and rat droppings are unearthed in storage and other areas
that customers do not see. Rat and mice carcasses are not
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors once discovered two rodent burrows in one
supermarket's dairy cooler. Inspectors over the years have
uncovered rodent-defiled macaroni products, a live rat and a
meandering mouse in a fresh corn display.
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is the sniveling rat that makes people most
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
"It is disgusting," said Brian O'Keefe, who has frequented the
city's KFC fried chicken and Taco Bell Mexican-American
restaurants. "I mean, rats are supposed to be on the outside. And
mice are on the inside. If there's rats inside you got a real
serious problem."
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to estimate how many rats there are in New York,
experts say, but one popular belief is that there's one for each
of the more than 8 million people in the city. Whatever the
number, the rats have continued to thrive despite the city
spending millions to eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
The typical New York rat weighs about 1 pound (45 kilograms) and
has a very flexible body, making it easy to squeeze though
openings as small as a half inch (little more than a centimeter).
Each year, a female rat can easily bear dozens of offspring that
survive, said Frank Gasperini, a pest-control expert.
</P>
<P>
They sometimes bite people, but mostly, they just eat -- at least
one ounce of food every 24 hours, according to Bobby Corrigan, a
rat expert. That means few food establishments are immune.
</P>
<P>
"Even the most famous restaurants can get rats," Gasperini said.
</P>
<P>
The city's health department finds evidence of vermin, especially
mice, at various eateries, from Caribbean restaurants to kosher
food shops. Health inspection scores at chain restaurants depend
on the location.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Leighton, the city's deputy commissioner of environmental
health, said sloppy sanitation can attract rodents. "The basic
message is, you need to remove food sources," she said. "In
restaurants, rodents are a symptom of poor sanitation."
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg, the exterminator, said wiping out vermin is
impossible. His company kills about 50,000 rats and 250,000 a
mice a year in the city, but it's a war that can't be won -- only
managed.
</P>
<P>
Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC-Taco Bell, said the
incident was unacceptable and a violation of its high standards.
The company said construction in the building's basement
apparently stirred up the rats.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, passers-by were still stopping to gawk at the now-
notorious fast food joint. West was one of them. She said she'd
never eat there again.
</P>
<P>
"I think this restaurant is pretty much done," she said.
