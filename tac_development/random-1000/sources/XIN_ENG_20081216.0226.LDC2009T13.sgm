BUDAPEST, Dec. 16 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Hungarian railway workers Tuesday continued their third day of
strike, disrupting train services throughout the country, the
Hungarian News Agency MTI reported.
</P>
<P>
Many trains, including all the international ones, have been
cancelled due to the strike, while others are running on shorter
routes or with delays, according to the Hungarian State Railways
(MAV).
</P>
<P>
The southern railway station in Budapest has been brought to a
standstill, but the western and eastern railway stations are
still operating.
</P>
<P>
The MAV and the railway workers' trade union VDSZSZ held talks
Tuesday morning, but reached no agreement.
</P>
<P>
VDSZSZ Chairman Istvan Gasko said the rail workers are determined
to continue their strike until an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which involves about 30 percent to 40 percent of
Hungarian rail workers, costs the MAV a loss of 700 million
forints (about 3.55 million U.S. dollars) each day, according to
Gasko.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's railway workers' trade union resumed an open-ended
strike from midnight Saturday. The strike was first launched in
February but has been suspended several times.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding a payment of 250,000 forints (1,340 U.S.
dollars) for every worker from privatization revenues of a unit
of the MAV and a 10 percent pay rise, to be paid retroactively,
for all those who are working for the MAV's subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
The MAV said it would not meet the union's "groundless" demands,
adding that the strike was aimed at disturbing the implementation
of the new railway timetables.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Janos Veres also rebuffed the trade union's
demands as unfounded Tuesday, saying that the government is not
in a position to fulfill such unfounded demands.
