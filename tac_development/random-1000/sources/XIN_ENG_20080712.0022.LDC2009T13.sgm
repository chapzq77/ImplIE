CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) on Saturday welcomed the
formation of a new Lebanese national unity government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday, AL Secretary General Amr Moussa
said he is very satisfied with the establishment of Lebanon's new
government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the Lebanese government on Friday is an
important step to implement the Doha agreement, which was reached
between Lebanese rival leaders on May 21, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief expressed his hope that Lebanon would turn a new
chapter in its history to safeguard security and stability of the
country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lebanon finally formed the new government following a
five-week political deadlock between the Western-backed ruling
majority and the Hezbollah- led opposition over key portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The 30-member cabinet consists of 16 ministers of the ruling
majority, 11 ministers of the opposition and three ministers
named by the president in line with the Doha accord which saved
the country from the brink of a civil war.
