Zimbabwe opposition offices raided, foreign reporters detained as
state media hit Mugabe foes

HARARE, Zimbabwe 2008-04-03 23:04:35 UTC
</P>
<P>
Intruders ransacked offices of the main opposition party and
police detained foreign journalists Thursday in an ominous sign
that President Robert Mugabe might turn to intimidation and
violence in trying to stave off an electoral threat to his
28-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mugabe apparently launched his campaign for an expected
run-off presidential ballot even before the official results of
Saturday's election were announced, with state media portraying
the opposition as divided and controlled by former colonial ruler
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission still
had not released results on the presidential election despite
increasing international pressure, including from former U.N.
chief Kofi Annan, who recently mediated an end to Kenya's
postelection violence.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change already asserted
its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won the presidency outright, but
said it was prepared to compete in any run-off.
</P>
<P>
The police raids came a day after official results showed
Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower
house. The election commission was slow on the 60 elected seats
in the Senate, releasing the first returns late Thursday that
gave five seats each to the opposition and ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai tried on Thursday to reassure security chiefs who
vowed a week ago not to serve anyone but Mugabe, according to a
source close to the opposition leader. But an agreed meeting with
seven generals was canceled when the officers said that they had
been ordered not to attend and that they would be under
surveillance, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The man, who requested anonymity because of the issue's
sensitivity, gave The Associated Press a copy of a letter signed
by Tsvangirai outlining "MDC guarantees to the uniformed forces
of Zimbabwe." It was given to the generals earlier in the day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The letter promises generous retirement packages for those
unwilling to serve an MDC government. It also promises not to
take back farms given to officers under Mugabe's land reform
program, except in cases in which an officer got several farms or
if land was being neglected.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear who ordered the generals not to attend the
meeting, but the fact that some senior officers apparently were
willing to meet with Tsvangirai underlined reports of rifts
within the highly politicized upper echelons of Zimbabwe's
security forces.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was
planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to
give security forces time to clamp down. The law requires a run-
off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could
change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in
Harare said.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat at the U.N. Security Council, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said if the run-off was put off the council might
have to take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti said hotel rooms used as
offices by the opposition at a Harare hotel were ransacked by
intruders he believed were either police or agents of the feared
Central Intelligence Organization.
</P>
<P>
"Mugabe has started a crackdown," Biti told The Associated Press.
"It is quite clear he has unleashed a war."
</P>
<P>
Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people
... including myself." He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had
canceled plans for a news conference. Tsvangirai was arrested and
severely beaten by police a year ago after a banned opposition
rally.
</P>
<P>
In a further signal of the government's hardening mood, heavily
armed riot police surrounded and entered a Harare hotel housing
foreign correspondents and took five away, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said Times
correspondent Barry Bearak, a winner of a 2002 Pulitzer Prize,
was among them. The identities of the other reporters hadn't been
determined.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists expressed
alarm and called for the reporters' immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said two of the journalists were
jailed and told they would be charged Friday with practicing
journalism without licenses. She said the other three were
released.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has ruled since his guerrilla army helped force an end to
white minority rule and bring about an independent Zimbabwe in
1980, but his popularity has been battered by an economic
freefall that followed the often-violent seizures of white-owned
commercial farms in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign,
the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was
running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and
it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
</P>
<P>
The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back
to whites.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make
an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but
gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and
agricultural production has plunged.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages
of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain
and other Western nations. But Western sanctions involve only
visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of
his allies.
</P>
<P>
Independent election observers say their projections based on
election results posted at a representative sample of local
polling stations indicate Tsvangirai won the most votes in the
presidential contest, but not enough to avoid a run-off.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first
time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting
advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face
a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old
president.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be
considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and
suppressing the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said Mugabe was ready
for a run-off.
</P>
<P>
"President Mugabe is going to fight. He is not going anywhere. He
has not lost," Matonga said on British Broadcasting Corp. "We are
going to go hard and fight and get the majority required."
</P>
<P>
Reports said leaders of the ruling party scheduled a meeting
Friday to discuss the run-off. Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's
secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many
meetings tomorrow," but declined details.
</P>
<P>
International concern mounted about the continuing delays in
releasing official election results.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see an official tally, see it soon and have
assurances made that this is actually a correct counting of the
votes," U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, said the delay was
dangerous and urged officials "to declare the election results
faithfully and accurately."
</P>
<P>
"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world
are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president,"
Annan said. "I urge them to do the right thing ... The election
results should be released now."
</P>
<P>
The election commission said it was still receiving ballot boxes
from the provinces, raising questions about where the votes had
been. The opposition has charged Mugabe planned to rig the
results, and Western election observers have accused him of
stealing previous elections.
</P>
<P>
According to official results, a total of 2,405,147 valid votes
were cast in Saturday's parliamentary contests, supporting
opposition charges that the voter roll of 5.9 million names had
been hugely inflated with dead and fictitious people.
