Hamas chief visits Saudi for talks: aide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hamas political supremo Khaled Meshaal is holding talks with
officials in Saudi Arabia, amid moves by the oil-rich kingdom to
boost its role in securing peace across the Middle East, a source
close to Meshaal said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meshaal arrived in Saudi Arabia late on Friday and is meeting
officials in Riyadh, the aide told AFP, without giving further
details.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia last February brokered a short-lived power sharing
agreement between Hamas and rival faction Fatah, which is led by
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government after Hamas seized
control of Gaza and has appointed a new cabinet based in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
He has since ruled out any dialogue with Hamas until it returns
the strip to his authority.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, a principal patron of the Palestinians and an
influential voice in the Muslim world, also played a key role in
the US-hosted Middle East conference held last month that aimed
to kickstart peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
