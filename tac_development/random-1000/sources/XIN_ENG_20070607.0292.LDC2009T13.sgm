BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday issued a notice to
call for intensified prevention and control of blue-ear pig
disease as the country is entering the peak season for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The highly pathogenic blue-ear disease, also known as Porcine
Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), has already killed
18,000 pigs this year.
</P>
<P>
The notice said local governments should improve the emergency
plans for the disease outbreak and section off and cease pork
trading in affected areas at the time of an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
New vaccines for the disease, produced under the supervision of
China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory Institution, have been
put into use, said the notice.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should establish immunity records for pigs, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The notice also said local authorities should increase studies on
the cause of the disease and strengthen inspections and
quarantine of pig delivery.
</P>
<P>
Pig breeders have been ordered not to kill, eat, sale and deliver
pigs that have died from the disease and treat the dead animals
and their excrement properly, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice also said stricter disinfection measures should be
taken in small pig farms.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, 45,000 pigs contracted the disease, but
a ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions
had reported outbreaks. Earlier reports said south China's
Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had
reported outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has dispatched inspection teams to supervise disease
control and prevention work.
</P>
<P>
The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some
areas. It is believed the price hikes will help raise the
country's consumer price index, or CPI, to a new high for May.
