</HEADLINE>

<P>
DR Congo President Joseph Kabila is to visit South Africa on
Thursday to meet President Thabo Mbeki and explore further links
between the two countries, the government announced.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and Mbeki will be in Pretoria to hear the conclusions of a
joint ministerial committee that has been meeting since Monday to
discuss cooperation between the countries, said government
spokesman Kudura Kasongo.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa already have
close ties, with some 30 cooperation agreements covering
everything from defence and education to infrastructure,
security, mining and energy.
</P>
<P>
South Africa played a key role in the process in the DRC that
ended the 1998-2003 regional war and helped fund the 2006
elections.
</P>
<P>
In August 2007 the two countries signed a declaration of common
purpose designed to reform the Congolese armed forces (FARDC).
</P>
<P>
South Africa is also very involved in DRC's energy sector,
helping restore the turbines at the Inga hydroelectric stations
in the west of the country.
</P>
<P>
The two power stations there have a potential to produce nearly
40,000 Megawatts of elecricity, a potentially valuable power
source for southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been experiencing increasingly serious problems
with power shortages.
