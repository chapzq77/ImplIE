India's communist party to protest naval war games
</HEADLINE>

<P>
India's communist party, embroiled in a row with the government
over a US nuclear deal, announced Saturday plans to protest next
week's naval exercises with the United States and Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Twenty five warships from Australia, India, Japan, Singapore and
the United States will take part in the exercises over five days
starting on Tuesday in the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Two US nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be among ships
involved.
</P>
<P>
"These exercises are seen as a major step towards India joining a
strategic security cooperation between India and the United
States, Australia and Japan," the Communist Party of India
(Marxist) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There will be countrywide protests from September 4 to 8 against
these exercises."
</P>
<P>
India's ruling Congress party receives crucial support from left
allies but the relationship has been shaky in past weeks, with
the communists protesting a recently concluded civilian nuclear
agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Protesters will march along the east coast to the port of
Visakhapatnam, headquarters of India's eastern naval command, for
a rally next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The exercises will be held between Visakhapatnam and India's
Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, a chain of more than 500 islands
over 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The communists, who oppose strategic ties with Washington, say
the nuclear deal threatens India's sovereignty, notably the
continued development of its nuclear weapons programme.
