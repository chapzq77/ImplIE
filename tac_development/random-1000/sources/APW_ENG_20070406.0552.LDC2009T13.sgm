<P>
The protest by +39 Challenge against United Internet Team Germany
after a collision that snapped the Italian boat's mast was upheld
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two boats collided around the windmarker of Wednesday's third
fleet race, also causing United Internet Team Germany to lose a
rig.
</P>
<P>
A jury ruled United Internet Team Germany didn't avoid contact
while performing a maneuver of opposite tack, and then cleared
French syndicate Areva after the German boat lodged a protest
against it.
</P>
<P>
+39 Challenge was awarded a fifth-place finish in the race,
giving the team an extra eight points to move it from 11th to
eighth in the Act 13 standings with 17 points from three races.
</P>
<P>
The jury also ruled the Italian syndicate would keep the two
bonus points it would have earned for finishing between fifth and
eighth in the standings, regardless of its final placing in Act
13.
</P>
<P>
United Internet Team Germany will bear the full costs of the
Italian boat's broken mast and has offered to let +39 Challenge
use one of its own masts until it's fixed.
</P>
<P>
Both teams would have sailed Thursday if poor weather hadn't
suspended the third day of racing.
</P>
<P>
America's Cup defending champion Alinghi leads the Act 13
standings with 33 points, six more than American entry BMW Oracle
and Emirates Team New Zealand.
