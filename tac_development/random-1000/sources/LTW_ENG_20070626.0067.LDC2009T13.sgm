Senior Citizens Unite to Save the Earth
</HEADLINE>

The nanas and the pappas are going green.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens and baby boomers across the U.S., many of whom
marched for civil rights and women's liberation, are mobilizing
to combat global warming and save the environment for their
children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
Take Green Granny, otherwise known as Joyce Emery.
</P>
<P>
The Ames, Iowa, retiree is the co-founder of greenseniors.org,
created in December to help mature individuals work together to
make the planet a better place for future generations. The Web
site features updates, news, trends and information on
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Emery also maintains a blog, www.greengranny.org, filled with
posts on the use of green materials and practices and links to
environmental action groups.
</P>
<P>
Don't let her warm, fuzzy moniker fool you. Emery, 63 and a
grandmother of six, is no little old lady in tennis shoes. The
former high school teacher and college professor who retired last
June, sees the business world's brain drain as the environmental
movement's gain and is working to inspire other retirees to put
their skills to work
</P>
<P>
``As folks reach retirement age and leave their jobs, a
tremendous amount of talent and experience walks out the door,''
Emery says. ``Those skills are vital to combat global warming. We
want to inspire people to join the effort.''
</P>
<P>
Research shows she has a motivated audience. A survey released
last week showed that the greenest Americans are the oldest
Americans -- 85 percent of individuals over 55 try to conserve
energy at home compared with 78 percent of Americans between ages
35 and 54, and 65 percent of those 35 and under.
</P>
<P>
``At first glance, the results of the study were a surprise,''
says Candace Corlett of WSL Strategic Retail, which released the
report, titled ``The Pulse, How America Shops Everyday.''
</P>
<P>
``But the truth is that this demographic grew up in a world that
was much less disposable. They grew up in an era of conservation.
They didn't buy and toss things. They saved, they reused and they
conserved. They've got a real head start on green philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
Older adults have had concerns about the environment and public
policies for some years. When grannyvoter.org, a nonpartisan
movement developed to help give mature Americans a voice in the
political process, was launched in 2004, one of the group's top
concerns was the environment -- specifically how state, local and
national candidates planned to protect the Earth from pollution,
depletion and climate chaos. The topic remains a priority for the
2008 elections.
</P>
<P>
Greenoptions.com, a Web site offering news and networking to
consumers interested in lowering their ``environmental impact''
while maintaining a comfortable lifestyle, recently launched
``Greening the Golden Years,'' a series of podcasts hosted by
retired radio journalist Max Lindberg.
</P>
<P>
The weekly programs feature interviews with and reports on
efforts by senior citizens to live greener, more sustainable
lives and reports on green products. Episodes have featured
interviews with Green Granny Emery; Ryan Chao, executive director
of Satellite Housing, a nonprofit developer of affordable, solar-
powered, senior housing in the San Francisco Bay area, and Byron
Kennard, executive director of the Center for Small Business and
the Environment.
</P>
<P>
``It makes sense that seniors are on the leading edge of this
movement,'' says Lindberg, 76, whose interest in environmental
issues was sparked some years ago by the alternative fuel
movement. ``We've been watching the environment die away. Now
we've got the time and the energy to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
There are easy steps you can take to go green and lighten your
``carbon footprint.'' Carbon footprints are a measure of the
effect our lifestyles have on the environment. Your carbon
footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases put into the
atmosphere by your personal daily activity.
</P>
<P>
For example, replace incandescent bulbs with energy-saving
compact fluorescents. Turn off lights when you leave a room. If
you must drive, schedule multiple destinations for each trip. Buy
produce that has been grown locally. Recycle plastic bags and
bottles. Try to purchase products with the least amount of
packing. When buying new appliances, choose energy efficient
models -- look for the ``Energy Star'' seal.
