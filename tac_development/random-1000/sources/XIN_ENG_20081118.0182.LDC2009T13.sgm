MONTEVIDEO, Nov. 17 (Xinhua)
</P>
<P>
Members of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) have agreed
to end a double tariff mechanism in order to facilitate the flow
of goods within the bloc, a Brazilian official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The double tariff will end in January, Regis Arslanian, the
Brazilian representative to Mercosur, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A tariff currently must be paid on all products entering Mercosur
and must be paid again if the goods are transferred to other
countries within the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Arslanian said that all work related to the ending of the double
charge must be finished before the Dec. 16 Mercosur summit in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur was founded in 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay. Venezuela signed a membership agreement in 2007, but
has not yet completed the process of full accession.
</P>
<P>
The bloc's associate members include Bolivia, Chile, Colombia,
Peru and Ecuador.
