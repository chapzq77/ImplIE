A bomb ripped through a Gaza studio of the official Voice of
Palestine radio on Thursday in an attack blamed on Hamas,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Palestine TV reported that the Gaza City radio studio was in
flames, forcing it to halt broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the radio station, which is close to Fatah,
is in the West Bank political capital of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
It was the first such attack against Palestinian media blamed on
the radical Islamist movement since bitter factional fighting
erupted in the Gaza Strip last week in a no-holds-barred conflict
that has killed at least 107 people.
</P>
<P>
Two other radio stations close to president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah
party also stopped broadcasting on Thursday -- Voice of Youth and
Voice of Freedom.

<P>
Fatah-loyalist Palestinian security forces on Tuesday laid siege
to the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas's Al-Aqsa television
before withdrawing.
