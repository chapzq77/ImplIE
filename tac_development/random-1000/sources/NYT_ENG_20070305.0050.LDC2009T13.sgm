EXPLOSION KILLS 20 IN BAGHDAD BOOK MARKET Reporting for this
article was contributed by Khalid al-Ansary, Hosham Hussein,
Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi and another Iraqi employee of The New York
Times. BAGHDAD -- A suicide bomber detonated a car full of
explosives in the historic booksellers' district of Baghdad
Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring 65 others, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing followed the opening of a new stage in the
intensified security plan for the capital, where more than 1,100
American and Iraqi soldiers moved on Sunday into Sadr City, a
stronghold of Iraq's largest Shiite militia.
</P>
<P>
The attack in the book market raised questions about the
effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently
succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in
the capital but not the number of car bombings.
</P>
<P>
The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep
black smoke billowing above the city.
</P>
<P>
Glass littered the roadway in the booksellers' district, known
for its historic buildings including former government offices,
and as the place where intellectuals once gathered in the city.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded next to a printing shop, sending sheets of
paper blowing into the air and littering the street with
smoldering bundles of envelopes.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters at the scene tried to get the flames under control,
but the blaze flared up repeatedluy because of all the paper.
</P>
<P>
The attack, one of a number in the weeks since the new security
push began, took place the day after Iraqi special forces and
British troops stormed the offices of an Iraqi government
intelligence agency in the southern city of Basra. British
officials said the raid uncovered about 30 prisoners, some
showing signs of torture.
</P>
<P>
News of the raid on Sunday, with its resonant themes of torture
and sectarian-driven conflict, appeared to catch Iraq's central
government by surprise, and raised new questions about the rule
of law in the Shiite-dominated south, where less than two weeks
ago Britain announced plans for a significant reduction in its
forces because of improved stability.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government gave no further statements or information
about the raid Monday. It was condemned on Sunday by Prime
Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a conservative Shiite, who said
nothing publicly about the evidence of torture.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into
the incident of breaking into the security compound in Basra and
stressed the need to punish those who have carried out this
illegal and irresponsible act," said the full text of a statement
issued late Sunday by his office.
