SEC unveils multibillion-dlr settlement with Citigroup
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it had
reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with US banking giant
Citigroup regarding its marketing of complex debt securities.
</P>
<P>
The regulator said that under the settlement's terms, Citigroup
has agreed to effectively buy back 7.4 billion dollars' worth of
auction-rate securities it marketed to tens of thousands of
customers.
</P>
<P>
The deal also requires Citigroup to "liquidate" by the end of
2009 some 12 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it
sold to other investors.
</P>
<P>
"Todayâ€™s agreement in principle provides real relief to
investors," said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the head of the SEC's
enforcement division.
</P>
<P>
"This settlement in principle is an outstanding example of
federal and state regulatory cooperation for the benefit of
investors and markets," Thomsen said at a news conference at SEC
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was announced by federal and state regulators as a
widespread credit crunch continues to weigh on major Wall Street
banks. Officials said the buyback will benefit around 38,000
investors, small businesses and charities who had purchased the
securities through Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
Auction-rate securities, essentially debt instruments issued by
financial firms, municipalities and student-loan companies,
typically have a fairly lengthy maturity, but the interest rates
on such securities can be volatile and change at weekly and
monthly auctions overseen by banks.
</P>
<P>
The SEC said Citigroup had marketed the securities as "liquid"
investments, meaning they were almost as safe and accessible as
cash, but the regulators said the securities were illiquid,
making it hard for investors to reclaim their holdings.
</P>
<P>
Such instruments formed a vital and lucrative business for many
banks in recent years, but the market for auction-rate securities
collapsed in February as the credit squeeze -- which began in the
housing and mortgage markets -- worsened.
</P>
<P>
The settlement comes on the heels of a separate investigation by
New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo into how Citigroup
marketed auction-rate securities.
</P>
<P>
"It will help to restore confidence in this marketplace," Cuomo
said, referring to the Citigroup settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's office is also probing how other big banks marketed
auction-rate securities.
