Chinese activist detained on way to church

A Christian activist was detained Sunday while bicycling to a
church service in the Chinese capital attended by U.S. President
George W. Bush, who emerged later extolling religious freedoms
before continuing with his Olympics visit.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, five Tibet activists, including a Tibetan woman from
Germany, were taken away by security agents after protesting near
Tiananmen Square, the latest in a series of small, short-lived
attempts by demonstrators to use the games to showcase their
causes.
</P>
<P>
Hours before, Hua Huilin said he and his brother, Hua Huiqi, a
housing activist and member of Beijing's underground Christian
church, were stopped by two black cars while bicycling to Kuan
Jie Protestant Church around dawn.
</P>
<P>
Hua Huilin said they were taken away in separate cars by security
agents, whom his brother recognized from previous encounters. Hua
said they took away his brother's Bible and cell phone. He was
released in the afternoon but Hua Huiqi was still at an
undisclosed location, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I told him not to go because it's during the Olympic Games and
this period is sensitive," Hua Huilin told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview. "But he was determined to go because he
said that church was where he was baptized. So I went with him
hoping to protect him."
</P>
<P>
The line was disconnected three times during Hua's conversation,
a sign that authorities were monitoring the telephone.
</P>
<P>
Hua Huiqi had been planning for days to be at the church at the
same time as Bush, but it was not immediately clear what he was
going to do.
</P>
<P>
A man who answered the telephone at the Beijing Public Security
Bureau's spokesman's office said they would try to find out what
happened. He would not comment otherwise or give his name, as is
common with Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
China allows worship only in officially approved churches such as
the one Bush visited Sunday with first lady Laura Bush, so
millions of people pray privately in house churches to avoid
detection.
</P>
<P>
After attending the service, Bush gathered for photos with
parishioners on the front steps.
</P>
<P>
"It just goes to show that God is universal," Bush said. "No
state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion"
-- a reference to China's tight control of churches.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if Bush was aware of Hua's situation.
</P>
<P>
In the Tibet protest, Padma-Dolma Fielitz, a 21-year-old Tibetan,
and another activist held the Himalayan region's national flag
aloft just outside the south entrance of Tiananmen Square,
according to a statement by Students for a Free Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Photos on the group's Web site show a woman identified as Padma-
Dolma being dragged on the ground as police and plainclothes
agents try to wrest the flag away from her.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, three other activists tried to unveil a banner
that said "Tibetans are dying for freedom" but were stopped by
authorities, the group said. All five protesters -- including two
Americans and two Canadians -- belong to the New York-based
group.
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, John Hocevar, a member of the activist group who
videotaped the protest, told AP Television News that Chinese
officials had escorted the group onto a plane bound for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetans insist their region was an independent nation
before Chinese Communist troops invaded in 1950, while Beijing
says it has been part of its territory for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Tibet activists say China is using the Olympics to legitimize
its rule in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration lasted about five minutes and all five were led
away, the group said. It was the latest in string of similar
protests in the past week as Beijing became a focus of
international attention because of the games, which opened
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities often round up activists before and during
sensitive periods, taking them to detention centers and other
faraway locations. They have already further tightened normally
stringent restrictions to curb potential criticism or protests
during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a human rights group said an activist whose husband
was jailed earlier this year has disappeared and may have been
taken by police to prevent her from speaking to journalists
during the games.
</P>
<P>
The group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said Zeng Jinyan
disappeared on Thursday and has not been heard from since. Zeng
is married to activist Hu Jia, who was sentenced to 3 1/2 years
in prison in April for "inciting state subversion." The Communist
government routinely uses the vague charge to imprison dissidents
for years.
</P>
<P>
Hua Huiqi, an underground pastor who has fought against a
development project in his neighborhood, has been arrested and
beaten several times over the last few years because of his
religious activities and has served six months in jail for
"obstructing official business."
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups say that charge stemmed from an incident in
which Hua and his mother scuffled with police as they prepared to
deliver a petition to the central government over the demolition
of their home in 2001.
