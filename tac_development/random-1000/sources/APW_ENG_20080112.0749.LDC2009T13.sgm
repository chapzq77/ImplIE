<P>
Fast bowler Dale Steyn took six West Indies wickets on Saturday
to lead South Africa to easy victory in the third test and a 2-1
win in the three-match series.
</P>
<P>
Steyn finished with 6-72 and South Africa won by an innings and
100 runs -- with two days to spare -- after West Indies' second
innings ended at 317-9. Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unable to bat
because of flu.
</P>
<P>
South Africa allrounder Shaun Pollock, his country's highest-ever
test wicket-taker, announced his retirement after the match.
</P>
<P>
West Indies won the first test by 128 runs and South Africa
leveled the series with a seven-wicket win in the second test.
But West Indies faced an uphill task to save the third test after
South Africa dismissed the visitors for 139 in their first
innings at Kingsmead Stadium, and then scored 556-4 in reply.
</P>
<P>
After a fourth-wicket stand of 144 between Marlon Samuels and
Dwayne Bravo, Steyn struck with the second new ball of the
innings, dismissing Bravo leg before wicket for 75 soon after
tea.
</P>
<P>
But Samuels managed to bring up his second test century, making
105 off 190 balls with 18 boundaries.
</P>
<P>
"We fought well," Bravo said. "We must remember South Africa is
the No. 2 team in the world, and we are a young team with new
coaching staff."
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the series, South Africa dropped two places to
fourth spot in test rankings, the International Cricket Council
said. Australia remained top.
</P>
<P>
Denesh Ramdin stayed with Samuels and made 25 before Andre Nel
tempted him to flash at a wide delivery outside the off stump and
give an easy catch to Mark Boucher.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after making his century, Samuels fell to a delivery from
Steyn which clipped his off stump.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal signaled a collapse for West Indies, and Steyn
ripped through the rest of the tail. Darren Sammy was out for 17
in a looping caught-and-bowled by Steyn, who also hit the
offstumps of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards -- both for ducks --
to wrap up the match.
</P>
<P>
Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the
series at an average of 19.10.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Samuels and Bravo saw West Indies reach 230-3 at tea
after a poor start to the day.
</P>
<P>
Resuming on their overnight total of 23, opening batsmen Darren
Ganga and Brenton Parchment added 10 more runs before Parchment
was trapped leg before wicket by Steyn for 20.
</P>
<P>
Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a
simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
</P>
<P>
Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before
wicket for 37. Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut
back in on him.
</P>
<P>
Pollock, 34, later announced it was his last test.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to be able to finish my test career on my home
ground, and especially in a match where the guys played so well,"
said Pollock, who said he would retire from international cricket
after the one-day series against West Indies that finishes next
month.
</P>
<P>
"But with Dale bowling so well, they don't need me," added
Pollock, who took a record 421 test wickets for South Africa at
an average of 23.11. Pollock also averaged 32.31 with the bat,
hitting a total of 3,781 test runs.
</P>
<P>
South African captain Graeme Smith acknowledged the contribution
Steyn made to the win, but said the day belonged to Pollock.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the whole of South Africa knows what a great player will
be missing from our team now, he is one of the all-time greats,"
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, Parchment was fined half his match fee by the ICC
after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct.
</P>
<P>
"In the eighth over of West Indies second innings, Parchment
intentionally ran into opposition fast bowler Dale Steyn," the
ICC statement said. Parchment has the right of appeal.
