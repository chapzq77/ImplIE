NEW YORK (AP) -- With so many jokes and cartoons about Sigmund
Freud floating around, one gets the impression that
psychoanalysis is no longer valid as a serious tool of
psychological inquiry, but a closer look shows that it is just
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 years after his death, Freud's spiritual heirs are
still turning out learned papers with great enthusiasm,
attempting to shed light into the dark recesses of the human
mind.
</P>
<P>
Providing a perfect forum for them is "The Psychoanalytic Study
of the Child," an annual started in 1945 by Anna Freud, the
icon's psychoanalyst daughter, and her colleagues. The title
seems to suggest that it only pertains to children, but actually,
it brims with articles of great human interest and originality on
topics that range from infancy to grandfatherhood, from the
origins of aggression to the mysteries of human resilience.
</P>
<P>
The volume is divided into five categories: Clinical
Contributions; The Child Analyst at Work; Theoretical
Contributions; Research Studies; and Applied Psychoanalysis. Of
particular interest to the general readership is probably the
last one, which deals with the psychoanalytic investigation of
movies, literature, philosophy and religion, among others.

An article by Eugene J. Mahon, M.D., a training and supervising
analyst at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute in New York, for
example, offers an intriguing view of "purgatory."
</P>
<P>
Purgatory as a concept was not always with us, he states. It was
"invented" by the human mind several hundred years ago to get it
out of the dilemma that the absolute concepts -- Heaven and Hell
-- had created for themselves in the first place, he theorizes.
He implies provocatively that this theological concept may have
unwittingly influenced Freud, who was an atheist, when he began
to reflect on the unconscious dimensions of guilt and human
morality as he set about "inventing" his own famous concept, the
Superego, the internal moral voice.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the volume, the contributors from the United States,
Israel, Switzerland and England mull over such intriguing
questions as why certain infants pull their hair out; what dreams
of children tell us about their developmental struggles; why
Stephen Sondheim puts so many psychopathic characters on the
stage; how "A Streetcar Named Desire" reflects the tortured
relationship between Tennessee Williams and his lobotomized
sister Rose; and what Romeo and Juliet can still teach us about
the turmoil of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
This inspiring collection of articles offers psychoanalytic
thinking at its best, and anyone who is interested in the
workings of a complex apparatus called the psyche will find it a
very worthy companion.
