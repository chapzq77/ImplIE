A damp ground delayed the start of play on the third day of the
first cricket test between New Zealand and West Indies at
University Oval on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bad light cut more than an hour from the end of the first day's
play and rain forced the abandonment of the second day without a
ball being bowled.
</P>
<P>
Though rain cleared late Friday afternoon, parts of the outfield
were still too waterlogged on Saturday to allow play to begin at
the re-scheduled time of 11:30 a.m. Umpires Mark Benson and
Amiesh Saheba made a ground inspection at that time and decided
to make a second inspection at 12:30 p.m. in the hope of starting
play before lunch.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is due to resume its first innings at 226 for four
with Jesse Ryder 54 not out and Brendon McCullum not out 4.
