U.S., Australian embassies in Jakarta receive bomb threats

<P>
JAKARTA, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Australian embassies in
Jakarta received bomb threats on Tuesday, as the country is
tightening security ahead of imminent execution of three Bali
bombers, police said here.
</P>
<P>
An official at the U.S. embassy confirmed that it has received
the threat.
</P>
<P>
National police spokesman Abubakar Nataprawira said the threat
was received through a telephone text message.
</P>
<P>
The police searching the embassies did not found the bombs, said
Natraprawira.
</P>
<P>
"The message was sent by short messages. We are investigating
this," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The threat said that someone has put bombs at the embassies and
will detonate should Amrozi Bali bombers were executed, according
to Detik onlione.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian police have boosted security at the U.S. and
Australian embassies and other spots in the country, especially
vital facilities, amid fears of reprisal attacks after the
execution.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the terrorists have extended their
target from the West-linked facilities to the objects that link
with the government interest. The police recently foiled a
terrorist-plot to explode an oil depot in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The Australian embassy was targeted by suicide bombings in 2004,
killing scores of people.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, had been hit by a
series of major terrorist acts from 2000 to 2005, including the
Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, the hotel explosion in 2003 and
the Australian embassy bombing in 2004, killing more than 250
people.
</P>
<P>
The international militant network of the Jemaah Islamiyah was
widely believed behind the deadly strikes.
</P>
<P>
Some 87 percent of Indonesia's 240 million population are
Muslims, and most of them are moderate and some of the rest are
radical.
