NEW YORK TIMES CORRECTIONS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 23, 2008
</P>
<P>
(These corrections will appear in The New York Times on
Wednesday. Date refers to the original article's transmission by
the New York Times News Service and will need to be adjusted.)
</P>
<P>
U.S.-DIPLO-ASSESS (moved July 21)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about the Bush
administration's diplomacy with Iran and North Korea misstated
the history of high-level meetings between American and North
Korean officials. While the meeting this week between Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice and North Korean Foreign Minister Pak
Ui-chun reflects a new willingness by President Bush to talk with
countries he has called part of the "axis of evil," it is not the
first such meeting since 2000, when then-Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright of the Clinton administration visited
Pyongyang. Rice's predecessor, Colin L. Powell, met twice with
his North Korean counterpart, in 2002 and 2004.

<P>
NY-BLOOMBERG-WEALTH (moved July 17)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about the ways in which
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg might be affected by the possible
doubling of his net worth following his agreement to buy Merrill
Lynch's 20 percent stake in Bloomberg LP misspelled the given
name of a novelist who writes about New York and money and who
said the added wealth probably affects Mr. Bloomberg marginally.
He is Louis Begley, not Lewis.
</P>
<P>
NY-BRUNO-EXIT (moved July 18)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about Joseph L. Bruno's
final day as a New York State senator, which he celebrated with a
tour of his district, misidentified the location of Joseph L.
Bruno Stadium, where the tour began. It is in Troy, not
Rensselaer.
</P>
<P>
HBO-SHOW-CAMPAIGN (moved July 14)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about a promotional
campaign for the HBO show "True Blood," omitted an agency that
helped create the marketing plan. Besides the advertising agency
Campfire, whose founders produced "The Blair Witch Project," the
Los Angeles agency ... And Company also worked on the campaign,
particularly on the print advertising mentioned in the column.
</P>
<P>
NY-TRIATHLETE-DEATH (moved July 20)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about the death of a
competitor in the New York City Triathlon gave an incorrect
spelling from the police for his given name and surname. He was
Esteban Neira, not Estaban Neiva.
</P>
<P>
ODONNELL-GAY-CRUISE (moved July 18)
</P>
<P>
A New York Times News Service article about an R Family Vacations
cruise for gay and lesbian families referred incorrectly to the
marriage of the comedian Rosie O'Donnell and Kelli O'Donnell, a
founder of the company. They were married in 2004, not
"recently."
