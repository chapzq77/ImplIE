LOME, Dec. 5 (Xinhua)

<P>
Delegates drawn from Togolese various unions Wednesday begun
reviewing the necessary methods of conducting credible social
elections to ensure the formation of representative unions in the
country, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to organize the Togolese union landscape more
efficiently as it currently experiencing leadership problems with
multiple unions lacking cohesion, said the unionists.
</P>
<P>
"We are making efforts aimed at creating perfect conditions to
determine the rate of representation for each organization, for
better cooperation and good management of professional relations
in Togo," they said.
</P>
<P>
For varied reasons and contradictory action by unions, problems
afflicting Togolese workers have not been addressed in a
concerted manner, notably the situation of nearly 3,000 casual
workers in the public service which has never been given the
attention it deserves to ensure their full integration, affirmed
the unionists.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Public Service Minister Foli-Bazi Katari said the
government will support "any efforts deployed to prevent
leadership squabbles experienced by a number of unions in the
country."
</P>
<P>
He warned that only those more representative unions are
authorized, among others, to negotiate and sign collective
agreements, and to appoint representatives in lawful bodies,
including the national council for social and economic dialogue.
