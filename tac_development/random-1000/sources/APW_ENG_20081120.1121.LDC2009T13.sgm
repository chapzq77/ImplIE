<P>
Argentina's David Nalbandian will face Spain's David Ferrer on
Friday in the opening match of the Davis Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Juan Martin del Potro, Argentina's top-ranked player at No. 9,
was drawn Thursday to play Feliciano Lopez in the second singles
match of the best-of-five series -- just like Argentina captain
Alberto Mancini wanted.
</P>
<P>
"Juan Martin had a slight preference to play second," Mancini
said. "And the fact that David is first is good because he has
more experience."
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's doubles, Jose Acasuso and Agustin Calleri of
Argentina will play Lopez and Fernando Verdasco.
</P>
<P>
The reverse singles will be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Argentina has a great team and they want to win and have a big
celebration," Spain captain Emilio Sanchez Vicario said. "But
we're Spanish and we also have a great team and we want to have
our celebration, although a little smaller since we're not in our
own country."
</P>
<P>
Nalbandian has lost six of the nine times he has played Ferrer,
while Del Potro has won two of the three against Lopez.
</P>
<P>
"Ferrer is a complete player, very even, solid along the back of
the court, and he runs and fights for each ball," Nalbandian
said.
</P>
<P>
Marcel Granollers, called up as a replacement for the injured
Rafael Nadal, could still play because each captain has the right
to make changes.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is hoping Nadal's absence -- because of tendinitis in
his knee -- will boost its chances to win the Davis Cup for the
first time, while Spain is trying to win its third title.
</P>
<P>
"Being hosts and with Rafa not coming, no one doubts that
Argentina is the favorite," Mancini said.
</P>
<P>
Ferrer agreed, sort of.
</P>
<P>
"With Rafa we weren't the favorites, and now, without Rafa, even
less," the 12th-ranked Spaniard said. "But that doesn't mean we
can't win."
</P>
<P>
This weekend's series is the second time the tournament will be
held in Latin America, after Chile lost to visiting Italy in
1976.
</P>
<P>
Spain beat Australia in the 2000 final and then defeated the
United States in 2004. The Spanish also made the semifinals in
1965, '67 and 2003, losing all three times to host Australia.
Argentina has reached the final twice, losing to the United
States in 1981 and to Russia in 2006.
</P>
<P>
But despite Nadal's absence, Mancini said the Argentines will be
tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish team has very dangerous players with experience and
good tennis is going to have to be played to win," Mancini said.
