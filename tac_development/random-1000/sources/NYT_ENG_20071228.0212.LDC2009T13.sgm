HUNDREDS HONOR GIRL WHO NEEDED LIVER TRANSPLANT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLENDALE, Calif.
</P>
<P>
She had sparkling blue eyes, a captivating smile and a strong
will to live despite her struggle with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Nataline Sarkisyan, the 17-year-old Northridge girl whose death
last week sparked a renewed call for health-care reform after she
was twice denied a prescribed liver transplant, was buried Friday
after a tear-streaked funeral.
</P>
<P>
"Though she is no longer with us physically, she is now resting
peacefully in the presence of God," said Archbishop Mousbegh
Mardirossian, western prelate for the Armenian Apostolic Church
of America, who presided over her funeral north of downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"She is the foundation and hope for tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Nataline died Thursday just hours after her insurance company,
Philadelphia-based Cigna HealthCare, reversed two prior decisions
to deny her a liver transplant despite the pleadings of doctors.
</P>
<P>
The insurance company, which deemed the surgery experimental,
stated it would pay for the procedure "in this rare and unusual
case" after loud public protest.
</P>
<P>
Nataline's case drew national attention among health advocates
and Armenian groups calling for reform.
</P>
<P>
"What happened here is a glaring example of what happens when you
let the insurance companies decide who lives and who dies," said
Geri Jenkins, co-president of the California Nurses Association,
before she attended the funeral.
</P>
<P>
"We've put the insurance companies in the driver's seat -- and
that needs to change."
</P>
<P>
"We're here because of an insurance failure, not being able to
get a patient in time," added Berdj Kasbarian, president of the
Hye Riders Motorcycle Club, among two dozen Armenian bikers
attending the service.
</P>
<P>
"We should change the health-care system to a European system,
where everybody is covered."
</P>
<P>
More than 800 mourners in black packed the ornate St. Mary's
Armenian Apostolic Church in Glendale to hail Nataline's zest for
life.
</P>
<P>
They wore ribbons of pink, her favorite color.
</P>
<P>
And they wiped their eyes before the white and gold casket
bearing the Granada Hills Charter High School student.
</P>
<P>
Priests waved chalices of incense as family members recalled the
curly haired teen who'd contracted leukemia at age 14, seen it
duck into remission, then strike again with a vengeance last
summer.
</P>
<P>
The day before Thanksgiving, her brother Bedig had donated his
bone marrow. But because of her failing liver, doctors
recommended a transplant.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 11, Cigna denied a liver transplant for the girl, despite
the pleadings of physicians at UCLA Medical Center where she was
treated.
</P>
<P>
The Sarkisyan family has retained celebrity attorney Mark Geragos
for an expected lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"The last 3 1-2 years were extremely difficult, filled with
doctors visits, hospitals and pain," said Jeanette Sabonjian, the
girl's aunt. "(Yet) she had elegance, beauty and strength. She
had wisdom and life and courage.
</P>
<P>
"She never forgot how to live."
</P>
<P>
Friends said they'd never seen Nataline without a smile.
</P>
<P>
Despite being forced to study at home, she loved high fashion and
dance. On her bracelet, she'd worn a pair of ballet shoes.
</P>
<P>
And despite her condition, she always found the time to bake
cupcakes or dazzle diners with such dishes as artichokes with
peas, infused with garlic and lemon.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she'd planned a Sweet 16 party for 300 guests,
including a dipping fountain for chocolate strawberries.
</P>
<P>
"She was so big-hearted," said Raffi Ganoumian, her cousin. "In
the condition she was going through, she always put everybody
first."
</P>
<P>
But despite her charm, she bore a deep inner sadness, according
to her statements written three years ago and published for the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment my life has changed," she writes. "No wonder I
cry day after day, I am lonely without a friend, I feel locked up
in a den, life is tragic I don't know why."
</P>
<P>
Outside, friends and family gathered beneath gray skies to
proceed to her burial at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, followed by
an Armenian meal in remembrance.
