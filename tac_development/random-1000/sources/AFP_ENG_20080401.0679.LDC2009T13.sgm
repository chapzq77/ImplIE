Hong Kong share prices opened higher Tuesday, up 1.03 percent,
tracking Wall Street gains on the back of better-than-expected US
data, dealers said.

The Hang Seng index opened up 235.73 points at 23,084.93.

The strong reading on the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and a
warm welcome for the US government's plan to overhaul financial
regulation boosted sentiment, dealers said.

The Chicago index, a measure of business activity in the US
Midwest and considered a precursor to the Institute for Supply
Management's manufacturing survey, rose to 48.2 in March from
44.5 a month earlier, beating expectations.

However, dealers said they expected the market to lose momentum
due to weak A-share markets on the mainland and the possibility
of further tightening measures in China.

China's central bank reiterated Monday that it will continue to
tighten monetary policy as credit and liquidity are still growing
too quickly and fixed-asset investment is rebounding.
