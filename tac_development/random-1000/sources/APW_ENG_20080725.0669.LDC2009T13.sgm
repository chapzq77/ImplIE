England to decide next week whether to take part in Champions
Trophy in Pakistan

LONDON 2008-07-25 12:39:34 UTC

<P>
The England and Wales Cricket Board will decide next week whether
the English team will compete in the Champions Trophy due to
ongoing concerns over the security situation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The International Cricket Council confirmed Pakistan as the host
on Thursday, but the ECB will make a final decision on Aug. 4
with the participation of Australia and New Zealand also in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
"The ECB takes it own security advice," chief executive David
Collier said Friday. "Our board will be considering that on
August 4, so we will have a look at that. There were concerns
expressed not only by the ECB, but also by CA (Australia), CSA
(South Africa), NZC (New Zealand). It's a very fluid situation in
Pakistan at the moment. It's primarily the external environment
we're looking at and which we have raised some concerns over. We
will be monitoring that very closely."
</P>
<P>
Collier said England's players would be consulted before any
decision is taken.
</P>
<P>
"We're in very close touch with the PCA (Professional Cricketers
Association)," he said. "Clearly, other boards around the world
are in the same position. The safety and security of our players
is paramount and we won't compromise on that."
</P>
<P>
PCA chief executive Sean Morris said England's players did have
some misgivings about playing.
</P>
<P>
"We've still got some very serious concerns, despite the fact
that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have made every effort they
can to try to make it as safe as possible," Morris said. "But,
unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters
that are beyond anyone's control."
</P>
<P>
PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf tried to reassure participating nations
by noting the security at last month's Asia Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The security firm of the ICC gave us (an) 'A' grade in the
arrangements made during the Asia Cup," he said, adding that
Pakistan is a "safe country to play cricket in."
</P>
<P>
Ashraf's stance was backed by ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat.
</P>
<P>
"Our security advisers are very confident," Lorgat said. "We know
of no credible threat against the event or any players. The Asia
Cup was held recently and there were no incidents. It was a
pretty safe event."
</P>
<P>
Yet concerns remain. Australian Cricketers Association chief Paul
Marsh said a boycott was possible.
</P>
<P>
"There are many players, not just in Australia but all around the
world, that are not comfortable with going to Pakistan at this
time," Marsh said. "So, the sad part about all of this is that
the Champions Trophy looks like it's going to disintegrate into a
second-rate event, unfortunately."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Players' Association head Heath Mills said touring
Pakistan had met with unanimous disapproval from his players.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't one player I have spoken to who is comfortable about
traveling to Pakistan at the moment," Mills said. "From what
we've seen from the various security reports compiled prior to
the meeting in Dubai, there is no way you could consider Pakistan
a safe workplace.
</P>
<P>
"We're not in a position where we can compromise on this issue.
If we compromise on player safety for commercial considerations
or politics, then in my view we might as well pack up our bags
and go home."
