In Poland, uncertainty and fear cloud possible site of U.S.
missile defense shield

Beyond the barbed wire and camouflaged hangars that once housed
Soviet-made fighter jets, some see hope for a small airport and a
brighter tomorrow. But the future may hold a different twist --
and has many locals fearful of Russian retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The shuttered air base in northern Poland, which dates back to
World War II, is a likely site for 10 interceptors for the U.S.
missile defense program, a plan Washington says is necessary to
counter potential attacks from so-called rogue states.
</P>
<P>
Poland's new government is sounding increasingly skeptical about
the plan, arguing that it won't boost Polish security -- a
sentiment echoed throughout the farm country near the Baltic Sea
coast, where residents struggle to see any benefits at all.
</P>
<P>
"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet
and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said
Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who
lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment
blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Let's tell the truth here, it's not aimed against Iran, or
against Vietnam or whatever -- it's against Russia."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been wrestling with such perceptions of its plan to
place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar base in the Czech
Republic since opening negotiations with the two countries early
last year.
</P>
<P>
Washington says the system is needed to protect the U.S. and
Europe from emerging threats from so-called rogue states such as
Iran. Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that
such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its
security.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Gen. Nikolai Solovtsov, head of Russia's missile
forces, warned that Moscow could target future bases in Poland
and the Czech Republic with Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Slupsk, a town of 100,000 just 5 kilometers (3
miles) down the road, are worried, despite assurances from Polish
officials that the region will be the nation's safest if it hosts
the base.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it; if the base gets built, the Russians will fire
at us for sure, so we will in fact be the most threatened," says
Zenon Kuwalko, a 54-year-old engineer from Slupsk.
</P>
<P>
But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider
perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed
for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received any benefits from our cooperation with the
Americans so far -- not one thing," says Leszek Pieniak, 48, who
owns the Pod Kogutem restaurant near the base. "Not in Iraq, not
in Afghanistan, not in Poland -- nothing. We don't even have
visas. I'll tell my grandchildren that maybe in 20 years they'll
have a shot at visa-free travel to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
"I'm against the base and that's it."
</P>
<P>
Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares,
with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could
better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small
airport for business and tourism.
</P>
<P>
"I think that only a civilian airport and the economic
development of the region will allow us to overcome unemployment
and in the long run create jobs," says Jan Junczyk, 48, a reserve
captain in Poland's air force who once flew MiG 23s at the base.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense
block off and isolate our region."
</P>
<P>
Mariusz Chmiel, the county manager for the Slupsk region, which
includes Redzikowo, agrees that an airport would help stimulate
business and tourism in the area and help cut an unemployment
rate that he says hovers above 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chmiel, along with a handful of other local officials, on the
invitation of the U.S. Embassy in Poland, were flown in August to
the U.S. to tour Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, home to
missile interceptor silos.
</P>
<P>
The Poles also met with local Vandenberg residents to discuss the
base's impact on the community and possible growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't
built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for
international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says
Chmiel.
