14766	13106	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	NULL	She said a clearer understanding might emerge after two upcoming meetings: a gathering this weekend of its executive council, which includes bishops, clergy and laity, and of its House of Bishops in mid- March.

14769	13109	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	NULL	That pain was evident in several of the questions.

14780	13120	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
14781	13121	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.

14784	13124	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
14785	13125	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
14786	13126	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
14787	13127	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week.

14790	13130	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has similarly played down his goals, with aides saying they would be thrilled with a take of $7 million to $12 million this quarter.
14791	13131	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
14792	13132	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	One of the great unknowns is how former senator John Edwards, D-N.C., will fare.
14793	13133	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Clinton and Obama (as well as Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas) must pay at least some attention to their positions in the Senate, but Edwards is unencumbered by a day job and is still riding his popularity as the vice presidential nominee in 2004.
14794	13134	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.
14795	13135	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	For Edwards and other Democrats seeking to catch up with Clinton and Obama -- such as Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen.

14800	13140	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton.
14801	13141	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	His supporters say the strategy is working.

14803	13143	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
14804	13144	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	Obama's rivals argue that his ability to hold multimillion-dollar events in New York and Los Angeles belie the campaign's claim that his is simply a grass-roots movement without major financial players.

14810	13150	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	NULL	On Sunday, Bill Clinton hosted a 1,000-person gala at the Sheraton in New York

15184	13508	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain.
15185	13509	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	By spinning clockwise for yes or counterclockwise for no, the pendulum channels a magnetism of sorts to answer questions that transcend matter, Fincham said.
15187	13511	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Cross had called Fincham, who learned the art of dowsing at a school in Arkansas, for a second opinion about where to drill a new well.
15188	13512	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	``Relax.

15193	13517	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Question: Once in 2002, and again in 2006, I have had the wall- to-wall carpeting in my co-op professionally cleaned.
15194	13518	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
15195	13519	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	(By the way, I don't smell anything.)
15196	13520	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid over a concrete slab and that's the problem.
15197	13521	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
15198	13522	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
15199	13523	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	What else can be done?
15200	13524	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
15201	13525	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
15202	13526	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
15203	13527	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet of floor in a 24-hour period.
15204	13528	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Generally, the acceptable level is 4.5 pounds or less.
15205	13529	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
15206	13530	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
15207	13531	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	I think you have a legitimate concern, and I would advise against installing new carpeting in your co-op.
15208	13532	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
15209	13533	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now, what are your options?
15210	13534	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Well, let's assume your building is older and that the concrete has been in place for some time.
15211	13535	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
15212	13536	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	I would suggest installing a tile floor, which will allow some moisture from the slab to rise through into the living space.
15213	13537	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	To deal with the moisture from the slab, use one or two dehumidifiers.
15214	13538	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
15215	13539	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
15216	13540	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Q.: I've lived in my home for 48 years.
15217	13541	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
15218	13542	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
15219	13543	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
15220	13544	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	What's the truth?
15221	13545	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
15222	13546	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	``That's too much,'' he said.
15223	13547	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is to look for the white stones in the asphalt.
15224	13548	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	When you can see the white stones, then it's time.''
15225	13549	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
15226	13550	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Hope that helps.
15227	13551	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Q. I have a problem with clover.
15228	13552	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	How can I get rid of it?
15229	13553	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Also what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
15230	13554	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
15231	13555	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	I tend to have a lot of clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
15232	13556	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
15233	13557	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
15234	13558	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	I'm told by organic experts that, depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant after a season or two.
15235	13559	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin.
15236	13560	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Ants don't like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
15237	13561	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
15238	13562	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.
15239	13563	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks, silverfish, flies and spiders.
15240	13564	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	NULL	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.

15251	13571	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before Congress.
15253	13573	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
15259	13577	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
15260	13578	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	``Americans deserve an even-handed assessment of conditions in Iraq.

15264	13582	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
15265	13583	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
15269	13585	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	But both the White House and Congress have widely described the assessment as coming from Petraeus.
15270	13586	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
15271	13587	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
15275	13590	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
15277	13592	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	They said they will continue to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from Washington.
15279	13594	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
15280	13595	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
15281	13596	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
15282	13597	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.
15286	13600	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	NULL	Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few weeks.

15293	13607	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
15294	13608	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
15295	13609	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Over the last 10 years, the yen carry trade -- the practice of borrowing Japanese yen at almost zero interest and using that cash to finance higher-return investments mostly outside Japan -- became a favorite speculative tool of global hedge funds and small Japanese investors alike.
15296	13610	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
15297	13611	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	The markets have now had a real-world look at what happens when that edifice of debt unravels.
15298	13612	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
15299	13613	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
15302	13615	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	"These are trades that everybody in our business knew were going to come unstuck."
15303	13616	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much over."
15304	13617	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
15307	13620	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
15308	13621	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	A stronger yen means that Japanese exports become more expensive overseas.
15309	13622	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.
15312	13624	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	But the volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it does, "the carry trade will resume."
15313	13625	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	In Japan, the debate over the future of the carry trade is partly a quarrel over whether traditionally cautious Japanese investors have developed an enduring appetite for risk.
15314	13626	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.
15315	13627	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	That view explains, in part, why there was a rush to convert investments back into yen last week: The currency is seen as a safe haven in times of volatile markets, and Japanese investors were with the pack that was fleeing the carry trade.
15316	13628	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	Recent surveys conducted by the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan also show that consumers here generally continue to be wary about their economic prospects.
15317	13629	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	But others contend that all the talk about the carry trade obscures a shift in attitudes among Japanese investors, who are increasingly eager to seek out foreign investments -- even risky ones -- to diversify their holdings and increase returns.
15318	13630	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	NULL	The Nikkei index was down 9 percent last week, including a 5.4 percent plunge Friday that was the worst single-day drop since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

15337	13644	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	NULL	Such schooling "tears apart" the arguments of al-Qaida, such as "Let's kill innocents" and helps to "bring some of the edge off" the detainees, he said.
15341	13647	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	NULL	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.

15618	13914	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	The case has also raised many questions: How could the products remain on the market for so long without proof they work?
15619	13915	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
15620	13916	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Why didn't the medical establishment warn parents?
15621	13917	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
15622	13918	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
15623	13919	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.

15628	13924	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the market before government requirements for stringent testing, and it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in children.
15629	13925	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had authority to regulate them closely.
15630	13926	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.

15634	13930	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
15635	13931	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
15636	13932	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.

15641	13937	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions.
15643	13939	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	NULL	The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a similar conclusion in 2004.

15832	14113	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	NULL	It's just not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.

15864	14145	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	NULL	The department's objectives are twofold.
15865	14146	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	NULL	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
15866	14147	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	NULL	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
15867	14148	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	NULL	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.

15869	14150	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	NULL	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.

16234	14485	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.

16243	14492	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.

16248	14497	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
16249	14498	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	That is an expensive and time-consuming process.

16251	14500	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
16252	14501	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without significant loss of yield.
16254	14503	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.

16261	14508	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	NULL	As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without other problems arising.

16283	14530	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
16284	14531	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.
16285	14532	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now that the bubble has burst, we are coming to accept the reality of lower prices, reduced production, declining homeownership rates and the wisdom that a house is not an ATM or a substitute for a retirement fund.

16287	14534	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real estate.

16291	14538	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	While there's an ongoing debate about why the price of oil has doubled over the past year, there is little doubt that the declining dollar is a significant factor.
16293	14540	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	In the process of maintaining those dollar pegs and reinvesting those surpluses in Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, they created a surfeit of cheap credit that spawned all those bubbles.
16294	14541	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
16295	14542	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
16296	14543	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Producers have raised their dollar prices to prevent a decline in the global purchasing power from their commodities sales.
16297	14544	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
16298	14545	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	At some point, that speculative bubble will burst and energy prices will plunge.

16300	14547	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem.
16301	14548	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
16302	14549	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	That includes such things as cleaning planes

16307	14554	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
16308	14555	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
16309	14556	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
16310	14557	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
16312	14559	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	And you can add a third blow, this one from government.

16314	14561	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Here in Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as the eye can see.
16315	14562	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble.

16317	14564	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	One option is to raise taxes and leave less money for private spending, which is what many state and local governments have begun to do.
16318	14565	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
16319	14566	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	Either way, it amounts to a lower standard of living than we thought we had achieved.

16322	14569	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	But it does represent the end of a decade or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world -- and by their own leaders -- to live way beyond their means.
16323	14570	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	NULL	As a result, the United States has gone from being the largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor.

17363	15504	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	NULL	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.

17585	15708	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
17586	15709	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
17587	15710	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	-Never target the victim.
17588	15711	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	This can be perceived as mean humor.
17589	15712	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
17590	15713	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
17592	15715	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
17593	15716	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	The most successful administrators were the ones who made spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments.

17595	15718	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."
17596	15719	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	One person makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the meeting.

17601	15724	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	NULL	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."

18655	16708	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NULL	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
18657	16710	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NULL	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.

19805	17784	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	NULL	Potvin also said players have to take it upon themselves to stop being whistled for untimely penalties.

19833	17811	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
19835	17813	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
19836	17814	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.
19837	17815	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	This isn't terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened yesterday.
19838	17816	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	(Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie critics.)
19839	17817	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of Hong Kong.
19840	17818	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a surprise, the movie was a drag.

19843	17821	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
19844	17822	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	But we've been here before, no?
19845	17823	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
19846	17824	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	It's a notch above this, their Hollywood debut.
19847	17825	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	The noise and cheap bumps in the night from the Pangs' movie have been toned down, but without them you realize that atmosphere was all the Pangs had going for them.
19848	17826	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.

19850	17828	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.

19852	17830	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	Her voice has pleasingly rich character.
19853	17831	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"
19854	17832	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	She narrates "The Eye."
19855	17833	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.

19864	17842	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
19865	17843	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	NULL	One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished niceness she radiates on screen.

21622	19455	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	In Hasselbeck they trust Since stepping back in as the Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season, Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
21623	19456	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Completing 61 percent of his passes.
21624	19457	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record 3,966 yards last year.
21625	19458	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
21626	19459	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
21627	19460	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
21628	19461	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
21629	19462	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
21631	19464	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	First, and perhaps foremost, he was coach Mike Holmgren's handpicked passer to replace a couple of local quarterbacks--Jon Kitna, who was not re-signed after the 2000 season
21632	19465	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	and Brock Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him the starter not once but twice in 2000.
21633	19466	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the story of what his first season and a half were like.
21634	19467	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
21635	19468	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won).
21636	19469	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
21637	19470	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	There were the ineffective and sometimes downright inept efforts when Hasselbeck had to step in for an injured Dilfer in 2002.
21638	19471	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
21639	19472	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson said.
21641	19474	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
21642	19475	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Hasselbeck's face and voice are seemingly everywhere.

21644	19477	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	In newspaper ads for Jones Soda.
21645	19478	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	In radio spots for Infiniti.

21648	19481	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
21649	19482	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
21650	19483	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
21651	19484	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	"But when I was positive he could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to go, it was actually one of our tough years."
21652	19485	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	It was, in fact, 2002.
21653	19486	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
21654	19487	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
21656	19489	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren said.
21657	19490	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	"And that's what happened."
21658	19491	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	NULL	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.
21659	19492	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	NOT THE SEASON YANKEES MANAGER JOE GIRARDI EXPECTED
21660	19493	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	NEW YORK
21661	19494	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Several months ago, manager Joe Girardi studied the Yankees' schedule and noticed that their final game at Yankee Stadium would be Sept. 21.
21662	19495	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	But Girardi did not believe it would be the final time he would manage in the ballpark.
21663	19496	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	He expected the Yankees to make the playoffs in his first season, expected the Stadium to live into October in its last season.
21664	19497	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	But sometime soon, the Yankees will learn that they have been mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.
21665	19498	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
21666	19499	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
21667	19500	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a miracle.
21668	19501	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
21669	19502	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
21670	19503	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"We expected more.
21671	19504	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	For whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to where we thought we were going to get."
21673	19506	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
21674	19507	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.
21675	19508	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said.
21676	19509	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"I feel that I should have been able to make us better.
21677	19510	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	I don't know how you can think any differently."
21679	19512	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
21680	19513	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
21681	19514	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
21682	19515	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from finishing in fourth place.
21684	19517	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage?
21685	19518	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
21686	19519	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Is he too controlling?
21687	19520	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	How does his intense approach influence his players?
21688	19521	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
21689	19522	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
21691	19524	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'

21693	19526	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
21694	19527	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
21695	19528	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
21696	19529	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest morsel of data.
21697	19530	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
21698	19531	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
21699	19532	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.

21702	19535	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism.
21703	19536	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Torre overused some pitchers and did not trust others.
21704	19537	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
21706	19539	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NULL	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
