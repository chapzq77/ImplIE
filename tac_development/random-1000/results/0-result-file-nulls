1	2	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera is giving up "The Ghosts."
2	3	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting costs in the wake of the economic downturn, the Met is dropping next season's highly anticipated revival of John Corigliano's "The Ghosts of Versailles" that was to feature the company debut of Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.
3	5	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"In looking at ways to economize, that was an unfortunate sacrifice," Gelb said in a telephone interview.
4	6	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's a much more expensive revival than most."
5	7	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said all eight new productions will proceed as planned, but that some revivals may be replaced with less expensive ones.
6	8	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in March 2010.
7	9	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting it will save more than $1 million.
8	10	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"If you look around at all the opera houses and what's happening, it's obvious that this is a time of crisis.
9	11	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Peter is just doing what he can to save the company," Corigliano said.
10	12	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Times have changed from the past in terms of grand opera.
11	13	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In this country, at least, it's certainly boning down."
12	14	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb had been a big proponent of increasing the Met's presentations of works by living composers.
13	15	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We will plan to put it in on at another time," he said.
14	16	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Chenoweth was understanding.
15	18	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"She has a great deal of respect for Peter Gelb and understands the steps that need to be taken during this economic crisis."
16	20	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"As we are examining the cost of running the Met season with an ever-increasingly careful eye toward saving costs, we're looking at the running costs of certain revivals compared to others," Gelb said.
17	21	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It will involve the shifting of some repertoire."
18	22	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	He was not prepared to announce other shifts in revivals because discussions with the singers are ongoing.
19	23	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The decision by the Met, the largest musical institution in the United States, is the most high-profile evidence of the profound changes the economy is causing in the arts world.
20	24	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Washington National Opera announced this week that it is postponing next season's presentation of Wagner's four-opera "Der Ring des Nibelungen," which had been planned since 2001.
21	25	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The company said that while it anticipated sellouts, "even the strongest ticket sales cover only a fraction of production expenses and the opera must look to the generosity of individuals, foundations and corporations to support its work."
22	28	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	There is a chance Opera Pacific will close for good.
23	29	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gerard Mortier, who was to take over as general manager and artistic director of the New York City Opera next season, quit last Friday because the company failed to raise enough money to pay for his plans.
24	30	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Change has been less drastic at the Met.
25	31	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Next season is the first completely planned by Gelb, and the eight new productions are the Met's most since 1966-67, its initial season at Lincoln Center.
26	32	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb responded to inquiries about the change in plans a day after the Web site Opera Chic said the Met intended to cut four unspecified productions from next season's schedule.
27	33	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said that when this season opened late September, the box office had been 2 percent ahead of the 2007-08 season, when prices were essentially the same.
28	34	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Now, the season-to-season comparison is even.
29	35	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We're experiencing fluctuations at the box office," he said.
30	36	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Things are less predictable than they were last season."

50	67	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Indonesia is failing to protect millions of domestic workers, some as young as 12, who face long hours, potentially deadly beatings and sexual abuse, Amnesty International said in a report released Wednesday.
51	68	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The estimated 2.6 million domestic workers in Indonesia are generally considered second-class citizens, the London-based rights watchdog said.
52	69	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Too many women domestic workers in Indonesia ... face human rights abuses at work," said the report entitled Exploitation and abuse: the plight of women domestic workers.
53	70	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Often forced to work from as young as 12 years of age, they suffer economic exploitation and poor working conditions, as well as gender-based discrimination.
54	71	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Many are subjected to physical, psychological and sexual violence.
55	72	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some are even killed."
56	73	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The report details cases of women and girls who were abused, raped and even beaten to death by their employers.
57	74	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty said their plight often remained hidden, as they were ashamed of talking about their experiences, and the authorities and general public appeared oblivious to them.
58	76	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some 640,000 Indonesians work abroad, mostly as maids, with Malaysia one of the top destinations.
59	78	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"This means they are not able to form trade unions or get any help legally."
60	79	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Government moves to address the problem were falling short, the report said, "leaving millions of women vulnerable to abusive employers."
61	80	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	While the government had submitted a draft law on domestic workers, it omitted basic rights given to other workers such as limits on working hours and a minimum wage, and most people were also unaware that a law on domestic violence applied to maids, Amnesty said.
62	81	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Like every other human being, domestic workers have rights -- including the right to be free from violence, the right to rest and the right to be paid an adequate wage.
63	83	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty called on the government to ensure maids received the same protection as other workers.
64	84	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"The government needs to stop viewing domestic workers as inferior and give them the same legal protections as other workers.
65	85	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	It also needs to educate police, the courts, employers and recruitment agencies on the fact that violence against domestic workers is a criminal offence," Hill said.
66	87	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Why is it they make movies out of crummy '70s television series ("Starsky and Hutch," "Charlie's Angels,") but not good '70s television series?
67	88	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Yes, there were some - and not only sitcoms.
68	89	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Where, for example, is the movie version of "The Rockford Files"?
69	90	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Jim Rockford very much belongs in the great, shaggy tradition of the LA detective.
70	91	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Philip Marlowe is only the most famous (James Garner, who played Rockford, took a swing at Raymond Chandler's creation in a 1969 film version of "The Little Sister").
71	92	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	There's also J.J. Gittes, Lew Archer, Joe Friday, Easy Rawlins.
72	93	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	In fact, Easy Rockford might be a more suitable name for Garner's character.
73	94	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Rockford has a relaxed unflappability that's a major factor in the show's appeal.
74	95	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Rockford's personality also owes something to Elliott Gould's take on Marlowe, in Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye" - though the Malibu where Rockford parks his trailer is a lot different from the one Gould's Marlowe contends with.
75	96	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	"The Rockford Files": Season Five consists of 20 episodes on five discs, with no extras.
76	97	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Well, Rockford always was a no-frills sort of guy - except for that answering machine which opened each episode.
77	98	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Even if he didn't get much respect on the air, he did offscreen.
78	99	NYT_ENG_20080114.0047.LDC2009T13	Season five saw the show win an Emmy for outstanding drama.

84	106	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	There are "major uncertainties" swirling around the economic outlook for the euro zone in 2008, the president of the European Central Bank said.
85	107	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	In an interview with EuroNews that aired Friday, Jean-Claude Trichet said that the bank's governing council, which sets interest rates for the 13-nation euro zone, are worried about the risk of weaker growth.
86	108	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It is true there are major uncertainties with regard to the economic situation," he said.
87	109	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"The council of governors of the ECB feels that there is a greater risk of weaker growth, with it going below around 2 percent."
88	110	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	A transcript of the interview, along with a video, was posted on the broadcaster's Web site.
89	112	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"France will be hit, like unfortunately all countries, by a lower growth rate," making the government's forecast of a 2.25 percent pace difficult to achieve, he said.
90	113	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It could be that the end of 2008 is a rebound moment if we see after six months that all the accounts have been balanced and confidence returns."
91	114	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet, asked why the bank has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent since June, Trichet said the ECB has been acting within its mission to control inflation.
92	115	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Our first mandate -- which the treaty requires of us and our fellow citizens demand of us -- is to ensure medium-term price stability is in line with our target, that is inflation of less than 2 percent and around 2 percent," he said.
93	116	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"In terms of the 320 million people living in the euro zone we therefore make our monetary policy decisions to ensure price stability.
94	117	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	That is our principal mandate."
95	118	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet also reiterated previous remarks that the bank would not tolerate the excuse of higher energy and food prices as a reason to increase wages, thus spurring inflation.
96	119	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Because then, we would have what we call second-round effects, leading to inflation which would be long lasting, instead of being temporary and related to higher costs for oil and raw materials and we would be unable to comply with our mandate, to ensure price stability, and we wouldn't be doing what our fellow citizens expressly ask us to," Trichet said.
97	120	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, the bank said it would mop up as much as euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion) in a move to drain liquidity from the markets.
98	121	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The bank also reaffirmed its intent to keep steering liquidity to a more balanced condition so as to align short-term interest rates with the refinancing minimum bid rate, which is 4 percent.
99	122	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The move followed a similar operation on Thursday, that was also for euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion).

106	130	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	SAfrican parliament rubberstamps Mbeki resignation
107	132	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ANC-dominated parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of effecting Mbeki's resignation from Thursday, September 25, with only 10 votes against the motion.
108	134	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Parliament will on Thursday vote on his election, and he will be sworn in later in the day.
109	135	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he says cost him his job as president.
110	136	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	In a September 12 ruling, judge Chris Nicholson dismissed a corruption case against Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma, hinting that Mbeki had interfered in the decision to prosecute his foe.
111	137	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, 66, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in June 1999, becomes the country's first democratically elected president to be forced out of office before the end of his term.
112	138	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter," said Mbeki in his application.
113	139	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified," he added.
114	140	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC -- a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years," Mbeki said.
115	141	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice," he added.
116	142	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The court ruling that was to prove Mbeki's final downfall found that the executive might have interfered in the decision to prosecute the ANC chief.
117	143	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I am not convinced that the applicant (Zuma) was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution," said Nicholson.
118	144	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	He was ruling on an application by the state to strike out sections of an affidavit filed by Zuma's legal team that insinuated political interference in the decision to charge him.
119	145	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki had been increasingly at loggerheads with his party, which split into two camps behind him and Zuma, after deciding to run for a third term as party president at a crunch ANC conference in December last year.
120	146	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Zuma toppled him as chief at the conference, and is the frontronner to be president after elections in April 2009.
121	147	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ruling throwing out corruption charges against Zuma led to a week of heavy political debate, and a lengthy meeting by the ANC executive who decided on Saturday to "recall" Mbeki in the interests of party unity.
122	148	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	When announcing his resignation in a live address on Sunday, Mbeki denied he had " compromised the right of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide whom it should prosecute and not prosecute."
123	151	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interim president and his or her team will have to carefully manage the transition so as to not worsen already weak investor sentiment and add to macroeconomic risks," it said.
124	152	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Motlanthe, who will take over from Thursday as president, is considered a key ANC strategist who has appealed to supporters of both Mbeki and the outgoing president's rival Jacob Zuma.

128	160	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
129	161	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Let's tell the truth here, it's not aimed against Iran, or against Vietnam or whatever -- it's against Russia."
130	162	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The U.S. has been wrestling with such perceptions of its plan to place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic since opening negotiations with the two countries early last year.
131	163	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Washington says the system is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from emerging threats from so-called rogue states such as Iran.
132	164	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its security.
133	167	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I don't like it
134	168	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	if the base gets built, the Russians will fire at us for sure, so we will in fact be the most threatened," says Zenon Kuwalko, a 54-year-old engineer from Slupsk.
135	169	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.
136	170	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"We have not received any benefits from our cooperation with the Americans so far -- not one thing," says Leszek Pieniak, 48, who owns the Pod Kogutem restaurant near the base.
137	171	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not in Poland -- nothing.
138	172	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	We don't even have visas.
139	173	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	I'll tell my grandchildren that maybe in 20 years they'll have a shot at visa-free travel to the U.S."
140	174	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I'm against the base and that's it."
141	175	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.
142	177	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense block off and isolate our region."
143	181	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says Chmiel.

152	196	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall had earlier taken 3-50 and Charl Langeveldt 2-48, their figures inflated by a late flurry of shots as Dougie Brown (45), John Blain (23) and Paul Hoffman (18) took Scotland to its best World Cup score.
153	198	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith won the toss and opted to field, with Makhaya Ntini's return for fast bowler Andre Nel the only change to the team that beat the Netherlands by 221 runs on Friday.
154	199	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Both teams and match officials, who all wore black arm-bands, lined up on either side of the pitch to observe a minutes' silence as a mark of respect for Bob Woolmer.
155	201	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Watts and Haq were watchful early on to take Scotland to 16-0 by the eighth over, but Haq hit Pollock for two fours and Haq cracked a six off Ntini as 15 was added in the next two overs.
156	202	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall replaced Ntini in the 12th over and struck on his second ball with Scotland on 35, having Haq caught behind for 13.
157	203	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith brought on Langeveldt to replace Pollock and his second change also proved a master-stroke -- Watts (24) nicking his first ball to Smith at slip to leave Scotland on 43-2.
158	204	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall collected his second wicket 20 runs later when Gavin Hamilton (4) was caught driving to cover by de Villiers.
159	205	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Langeveldt did likewise by bowling McCallum (1) with a yorker and Scotland was 71-4 in the 25th over.
160	206	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Five overs later, Colin Smith, who scored 51 against Australia to become the second Scotsman to score a World Cup half-century, played a shot to point and de Villiers' direct hit beat Ryan Watson (31) home.
161	207	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith was bowled by a Pollock off-cutter for 15 with Scotland on 113-6 in the 39th over.
162	208	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	But Brown put on 50 with Blain inside nine overs after Ryan Watson (31) had earlier set a platform.
163	209	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Blain was finally out in the 48th, caught by Justin Kemp at extra-cover off Hall's bowling.
164	211	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The two openers were never troubled, until de Villiers was caught on the long-off fence by Brown off Glenn Rogers in the 16th over with victory in sight.
165	212	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Ashwell Prince was promoted up the order to gain some batting practice, before a heavy rainstorm stopped play at 147-1 for 25 minutes.
166	213	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The break didn't help Prince, who was caught by McCallum at short-cover for 21 from Haq's offspin with South Africa on 162.
167	214	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith was caught by Rogers at midwicket off Haq's bowling as he fell nine runs short of his maiden World Cup century -- with South Africa requiring 9 to win.
168	215	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Kemp (12 not out), who was also shifted up the order, finished the match with a massive straight six.

171	220	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Geelong Cats topped regular season standings by 12 points with a 19-win, one-loss record to secure the minor premiership, and confirmed their rating as the best team in the AFL with Saturday's historic win over the 2004 champions.
172	221	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"We were the best side all year and we thoroughly deserve this," Geelong midfielder Joel Corey said.
173	222	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong became the first team from the state of Victoria since Essendon in 2000 to win the AFL title when they eased to victory in front of a crowd of 98,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

175	224	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	He had previous captained Essendon to the championship in 1993.
176	225	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's 119-point win was the largest in grand final history, dwarfing Hawthorn's 96-point win over Melbourne in 1998.
177	226	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Cats dominated the match, outscoring Port Adelaide 5.7 to 2.2 in the first quarter, before kicking five goals in the first 12 minutes of the second quarter to build a 52-point lead.
178	227	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong were on top in every aspect of the contest, with their defense -- which has been the best in the competition all season -- keeping Port Adelaide to their lowest score of the year.
179	228	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"We just want to thank the fans for their patience," Thompson said.
180	229	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"It's been a long time coming but it's worth the wait."
181	230	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's Steve Johnson was named Man of the Match.
182	231	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Johnson began the season suspended for off-field behaviour and ended up an All- Australian and premiership player.

196	251	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the first attempt.
197	252	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
198	253	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	None of the plants was identified.
199	255	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on the beef recall Tuesday.
200	257	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use of electronic stunning prods

203	260	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for insufficient stunning.
204	261	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter.
205	262	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	While not a violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
206	263	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The problems uncovered by the audit have been corrected, Schafer told Kohl at Tuesday's hearing.
207	264	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added.
208	265	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We have helped train our inspectors to observe while being unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
209	266	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
210	267	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	I am working with USDA to gather more information about these audits and to find ways to ensure that the problems being discovered do not continue."
211	268	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer told reporters after the hearing that based on the audit's findings, he does not believe the problems at Westland/Hallmark were systemic.
212	270	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"But our continuing investigation will give us the full answer to that."
213	272	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.
214	273	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said.
215	274	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"This letter is not reassuring.
216	275	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	This confirms there are major problems with the inspection program and inadequacies with the law."
217	277	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California video released in January truly was an anomaly."

224	288	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	SEBASTOPOL, California 2008-02-26 00:05:57 UTC
225	289	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California's big reds are coming on strong these days as winemakers pursue riper, fuller-flavored fruit.
226	290	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	A number of wines have been creeping past 14 percent alcohol and even into the 15- to-16 percent range, as opposed to the tamer 12- to 13-percent of years past.
227	291	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	This is largely because vintners wait longer to pick their grapes.
228	292	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	More mature fruit is thought to make tastier wine, but it also means sugar levels have a chance to rise, which comes with the side effect of pumping up the alcohol volume.
229	293	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Warmer harvests only increase the phenomenon.
230	294	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
231	295	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
232	297	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Still, big reds, many of which are highly rated by critics, have their champions.
233	298	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"They fill your mouth with flavor
234	299	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	you can chew on them.
235	300	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	They linger on your palate when you're drinking them and that's what Napa is known for -- its big, chewy cabs," said Doug White, director of operations for the Vintner's Collective, a Napa tasting room specializing in boutique wineries.
236	301	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	For those who don't like the big wines, some have an issue with the style of higher-alcohol vintages while others are wary of the punch they can pack.
237	302	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One definition of the "right" alcohol level is if two people can finish a bottle and "wish there was a little bit more," said Dunn.
238	303	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.
239	304	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You'd be lying on the floor."
240	305	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	It's not always easy to tell just how much alcohol is in a wine.
241	306	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
242	308	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
243	309	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
244	310	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One way to have ripe fruit without high alcohol is to use various technologies available to pull alcohol out of wine.
245	312	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The truth is that wine has already been affected by technology, from stainless steel tanks to sterile filtration, he said.
246	313	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Unlike cooking, where chefs proudly show off new techniques made possible through innovation, winemaking's become more secretive, said Smith.

248	315	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Vinovation's process works by using powerful filters that remove alcohol and water from wine.
249	316	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
250	317	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
251	318	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
252	319	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the grower," he said.
253	321	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"We like our wines.
254	322	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the fruit.
255	323	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the richness," he said.
256	324	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Shafer is aware of the debate over how much is too much, but says it's up to consumers to decide what style of wine they prefer.
257	325	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling everything," he points out.
258	326	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Industry wide, "the quality of wines from around the world just keep getting better and better," Shafer said.
259	327	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think this is the golden age for the consumer."

265	333	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	CLEVELAND - They were kings of the road.
266	334	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are road kill.
267	335	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And it's giving their fans road rage.
268	337	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Hub hoop junkies witnessed the ease of a Game 2 victory at TD Banknorth Garden and concluded that the real Celtics were ready to take it to the streets of Cleveland.
269	338	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No more of the nonsense that plagued them for three long nights in Atlanta.
270	339	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And then the game started and Boston's swagger and superiority evaporated.
271	340	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Again.
272	341	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics didn't show up.
273	342	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got run out of the gym, 108-84, last night by the same team that couldn't score 75 points in the New Garden.
274	343	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
275	344	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It wasn't about LeBron James this time.
276	345	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The King carried his shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor).
277	346	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it didn't matter because the Cavaliers ran away from the Celtics long before halftime.
278	347	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the second.
279	348	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics never got closer than 12 after intermission.
280	349	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Boston's no-show included taking only two free throws in the first half, which ended with the Cavaliers leading, 52-35.
281	350	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Paul Pierce took eight shots all night.
282	351	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Ray Allen shot 4 for 12.
283	352	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Point guard Rajon Rondo had zero assists in 23 minutes.
284	353	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland has the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier attitude.
285	354	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers.
286	355	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"I thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the game.
287	356	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	In every way they beat us tonight.
288	357	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They outcoached us, they played harder, they got the loose balls.
289	358	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We were not comfortable.
290	359	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We didn't make plays.
291	360	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Instead of being the solid defensive team that we've been, I thought we got down because our offense wasn't going."
292	361	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This makes the Green 6-0 at home and 0-4 on the road in this postseason.
293	362	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Though it is technically possible for the Celtics to win the championship if this continues, the hot-cold, home-away dynamic does little to inspire confidence.
294	363	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This caliber of play is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or Hornets.
295	364	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So the same questions will be asked before the Celtics play Game 4 here tomorrow night.
296	365	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The questions will be asked again and again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.
297	366	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Strange.
298	367	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road this season.
299	368	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They swept through Texas, which is virtually impossible in today's NBA.
300	369	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And now they are neutralized and intimidated by the likes of Philips Arena and Quicken Loans Arena.
301	370	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	What gives?
302	371	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"This is the NBA," said Rivers.
303	372	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Nothing surprises me in this league.
304	373	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Did I think this would happen?
305	374	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No.
306	375	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it did happen.
307	376	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So now we just have to get ready for Monday night."
308	377	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Asked to account for the home-road disparity, Rivers said, "I can't.
309	378	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But we have to find out why."
310	379	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We definitely took our lumps tonight," admitted Pierce.
311	380	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We're going to come out better in Game 4.
312	381	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to come out to a better start."
313	382	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When Pierce was asked if he was worried, he said, "A little bit.
314	383	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I'm disappointed.
315	384	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be a lot more aggressive.
316	385	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be aggressive on the road."
317	386	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This was never a game.
318	387	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland's Ben Wallace recovered from his Game 2 vapors and made his first three shots as the Cavaliers bolted to a 22-8 lead.
319	388	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	That's a 14-point lead.
320	389	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I know this only because the overhead scoreboard at The Q offers a moronic feature entitled "The Diff."
321	390	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When it was 22-8, The Diff was 14.
322	391	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Thanks.
323	392	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	(Wonder if there are any hockey or soccer scoreboards that offer The Diff?)
324	393	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics were hoping to avoid.
325	394	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We've got to come out in the first quarter and put up a better fight," said Celtics guard Sam Cassell.
326	395	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We refused to play together offensively," said Rivers.
327	396	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"And that's the thing that alarms me from Atlanta.
328	397	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got a lot of the offensive rebounds.
329	398	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But that's hustle.
330	399	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We have to do better."
331	400	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	There is cause for concern.
332	401	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This is a little more than a home- road thing.
333	402	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It feels like the Celtics are being exposed.
334	403	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Pierce and Allen have not been the same players they were during the regular season.
335	404	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Rondo looks lost.
336	405	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The team that won 66 games hasn't demonstrated the fortitude of a champion.
337	406	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They lost only 16 games during the regular season, never by as many as 20.
338	407	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are 0-4 on the road in the playoffs and smarting from a 24-point beating.
339	408	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for somebody to step forward.
340	409	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for the Celtics to show up in a game played outside the Garden.

344	414	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	A twice-convicted killer with a history of violence that continued even after he was sent to death row was executed Tuesday for gunning down two video store workers during a robbery 14 years ago in Dallas.
345	415	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I love all y'all.

347	417	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	See y'all when you get there," Leon David Dorsey IV said in his final statement.
348	418	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"Do what you're going to do."
349	419	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey, 32, acknowledged his sister when witnesses filed in but didn't direct any comments to the relatives of his victims.
350	420	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was pronounced dead nine minutes after the lethal drugs began to flow.
351	421	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey was the seventh prisoner executed this year in America's most active death penalty state and the first of two inmates scheduled to die this week.
352	422	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Two more are to die next week.
353	423	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year upheld his conviction and death sentence and no late appeals were filed to try to block Dorsey's lethal injection.
354	424	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Prison records showed that since Dorsey arrived on death row eight years ago, he's had at least 95 disciplinary cases, including a 2004 attack where he used an home-made knife to stab an officer 14 times in the back.
355	426	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks ago, authorities recovered another shank from his cell.
356	427	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	His threats of violence kept prison officials from making him available for media interviews as his execution date approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome inmates.
357	428	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	But prison officials said he offered no resistance as he was led to the death chamber.
358	429	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said, calling him a "true psychopath."
359	430	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery, when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video store in East Dallas where they worked.
360	431	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after midnight to steal $392 from a cash register.
361	432	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He shot the workers when Armstrong had difficulty opening a safe at gunpoint and Lindsey tried to run.
362	433	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Most of the crime was recorded on security cameras in the store.
363	434	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been the gunman.
364	436	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was in prison for that slaying when he was questioned again about the double slaying and confessed.
365	437	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview from prison while he was awaiting trial.
366	438	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I've done cut folks

376	451	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The results, after a similar outcome in two state elections in January, come amid an increasingly sharp conflict in Germany about whether the former Communists, known as the Left Party, would be a viable political partner in Hamburg and elsewhere in Germany.
377	457	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The Left Party, a combination of former Communists, disillusioned Social Democrats and western radicals, won enough votes last month in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony to win parliamentary representation.
378	458	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	While the Left Party is well represented in the east and has parliamentary seats in the northern city-state of Bremen, it had never sat in one of the large western states' parliaments.
379	459	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The votes contributed to a brewing sense of political helplessness.

386	469	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	China has investigated more than 6,660 government officials derelict of their duties for the past 19 months, said deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Wang Zhenchuan Wednesday here.

393	478	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Football: Win over Fiorentina puts Bayern on the brink
394	479	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern Munich ignored their poor league form to secure a convincing 3-0 win over Fiorentina in Tuesday's Champions League match in Munich to take control of Group F.
395	481	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Despite a dramatic slump in recent weeks which has seen them crash to 11th in the Bundesliga, Bayern forgot their domestic league form to take another three points in the quest to add to their 2001 Champions League crown.
396	482	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	The victory will take some of the pressure off Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann who picked up his first win of October last weekend -- his first in four league games -- as Munich's fortunes look to be improving.
397	483	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	With two wins and a draw under their belt in Group F, Bayern are now on the verge of making the first knock-out phase with seven points from Lyon second on five.
398	484	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But the result leaves Fiorentina in a precarious position -- especially after Lyon's 5-3 win at Steaua Bucharest -- at third in the table.
399	485	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern had a dream start when Luca Toni brushed off a rib injury to face his former club and flicked the ball into the path of Miroslav Klose who out-paced the defence to drill the ball into the corner after just four minutes.
400	487	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Having scored 31 league goals for La Viola in the 2005/06 season, Toni is still a firm favourite amongst Fiorentina fans despite playing for Bayern and received a warm response when he was replaced on 57 minutes.
401	489	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But Cesare Prandelli's team will leave Munich disappointed they did not finish their chances having had some 23 shots on goal, compared to Bayern's 15, but were constantly frustrated by Bayern's defence.
402	491	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But with three games left for both teams there is still all to play for in the return leg on November 5 when the two sides meet at Fiorentina's Artemio Franchi stadium.

431	539	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	China's cultural authorities are introducing a national qualification program for actors, singers and dancers.
432	540	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	The program, expected to start later this year, is open to all current and aspiring performing artists, said Guo Wei, an official with the Center of Cultural and Artistic Talents (CCAT) with the Ministry of Culture.
433	541	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"We hope the qualification will provide an authentic reference for art troupes and organizations in evaluating staff and recruiting new actors, singers or dancers," said Guo.
434	542	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	Sources with the CCAT said the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security have been planning the program for more than four years.
435	543	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"The purpose of such a program is to improve the professional level of China's art circles and discover more talented artists," said an official with the CCAT, who declined to be named.
436	544	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	The program would consist of two parts: a performance and a written test of professional knowledge.
437	545	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	Guo said the program is currently operating on a voluntary basis.
438	546	XIN_ENG_20070419.0037.LDC2009T13	"It is not compulsory now, but we hope it could be widely recognized in the future so that it could become authoritative."

556	676	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said the ship was hijacked Sunday.

561	686	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea," Christensen said.
562	688	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It is "the largest pirated vessel in the region" to date, Christensen said.

566	693	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The risk is low and returns are extremely high.
567	694	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	You will see more and more of such attacks," he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

569	699	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He said two small boats floated out to the ship and 18 men -- presumably other pirates -- climbed aboard with ropes woven into a ladder.
570	700	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"I have been fishing here for three decades, but I have never seen a ship as big as this one," he said.

585	722	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	DNA tests to identify the father of Anna Nicole Smith's infant daughter may not resolve legal struggles over custody of the girl, a lawyer for Smith's former partner said Wednesday.
586	723	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Howard K. Stern, who has been caring for 6-month-old Dannielynn in the Bahamas, was complying with the court ordered tests, but may not relinquish custody even they prove the father is Smith's ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead, attorney James Neavitt said.
587	724	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"Howard is the legal father.
588	725	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	If Mr. Birkhead's DNA matches, then he can come and say he's the biological father, and then you'll have that court battle," Neavitt told The Associated Press.
589	726	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Neavitt did open the possibility of a negotiated settlement if the test proves his client is not the biological father.
590	727	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	He said Stern respects Birkhead and that the two men will likely reach an agreement if the Los Angeles-based photographer is proven to be the father.
591	728	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"At that point, it will be a whole different scenario, and the two guys will have to work something out," he said by phone from Los Angeles.
592	729	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"Dannielynn's interests are the most important, and Howard's been protecting her from the start."
593	731	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	At the gated, waterfront home where he lived with Smith, Stern drove away with Dannielynn on Wednesday morning, then returned later without speaking to reporters.
594	732	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	The paternity dispute intensified after Smith, 39, died of still- undisclosed causes in Florida on Feb. 8.

596	734	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Last month, he too filed legal documents seeking a DNA test.
597	735	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Another contender for custody is Smith's mother Virgie Arthur, who says she could provide a more stable home than Stern and has asked the court to name her Dannielynn's guardian.
598	736	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Stern has been ordered not to leave the island nation with the girl before a custody ruling.

631	792	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Mixing penetrating groundstrokes, frequent use of the dropshot and often playing serve and volley, he immediately recovered a break to level the first set at 3-3 and then broke against for the set with a perfectly executed drop volley.
632	793	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Both players had break point opportunities in the second set, before Gulbis netted a weak backhand to give Gonzalez a break for 5-4.

671	851	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-09-18 11:13:23 UTC
672	852	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	A trial has begun in the case of a baseball player-turned-actor accused of brutally killing a cat in a jealous rage after complaining that his ex-girlfriend cared more for the feline than she did for him.
673	853	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Assistant District Attorney Leila Kermani said the cat named Norman died with broken teeth, broken ribs, a broken leg, a torn tongue, massive internal injuries including bruised lungs and a bruised liver and a chest cavity filled with blood.
674	854	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant, in a fit of anger and rage, beat a defenseless animal to death," Kermani told the jury in her opening remarks Wednesday.
675	855	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant killed Norman simply because he was an angry, jealous and drunken bully."
676	856	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Former New York Mets baseball minor leaguer Joseph Petcka, 37, is on trial on charges of aggravated cruelty to animals for killing Norman on March 27, 2007, after a night of heavy drinking.
677	857	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He faces up to two years in prison if convicted.
678	859	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"This was a tragic accident," Hochbaum said.
679	860	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was not intentional."
680	861	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum complained the district attorney's office never offered his client a plea deal.
681	862	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He said outside court he believes that was because of the publicity the case attracted and the urgings of cat fanciers.
682	864	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said one night they quarreled and he began drinking heavily.
683	865	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said she went to bed to avoid him but he woke her around 3 a.m. by putting his knee in her ribs and complaining that Norman had attacked him.
684	866	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Altobelli, a Sports Illustrated reporter, said she left the apartment after Petcka refused to calm down.
685	867	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said Petcka had complained, "You love that cat more than you love me," but she had no idea Norman would be in danger.
686	868	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	When she returned home Norman did not meet her at the door as usual.
687	869	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She found his body under her bedside table.
688	870	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Petcka, a pitcher briefly in the Mets' minor league system in 1992, later appeared in a paper towel commercial and had small roles in "Sex and the City" and other television shows.
689	871	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum said his client had more recently worked as a bartender and waiter.

696	878	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists have long prided themselves on their ability to peer into the distant past and discern the slow movements of land and sea that have continuously revised the planet's face over eons.
697	879	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Now, drawing on new insights, theories, measurements and technologies -- and perhaps a bit of scientific bravado -- they are forecasting the shape of terra firma in the distant future.
698	880	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The maps and animations by these scientists are helping explain core principles of geology to increasingly wide audiences.

704	887	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But their more short-term predictions, they note, draw on mountains of geophysical data and involve relatively small extrapolations of current trends, like the steady northward march of Southern California.
705	888	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Despite uncertainties, the field of geopredictions is booming.

708	893	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He and three co- authors present a snapshot of how the planet's surface might look 50 million years from now, calling it "a plausible scenario."
709	894	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the snapshot shows that Africa has drifted to the north, plowing into Europe and fusing the two landmasses, eliminating the Mediterranean Sea and replacing it with the Mediterranean Mountains.
710	895	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The rugged range runs down the middle of a continent far bigger than current-day Eurasia, a giant new agglomeration that might be called Afrasia.

715	901	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	You check the speedometer, do a calculation, and project your present motion.
716	902	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But beyond 50 million years," Scotese added, "like on the highway, unexpected things can happen."
717	903	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Forecasts of future continental motion developed slowly as offshoots of the theory of plate tectonics, which won acceptance in the 1960s and 1970s, shattering old dogmas of continental immobility.
718	904	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory of plate tectonics holds that the surface of Earth is composed of a dozen or so huge crustal slabs that float on a sea of partially molten rock.
719	905	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over ages, hot convection currents in this sea, as well as gravitational forces, move the plates and their superimposed continents and ocean basins, tearing them apart and rearranging them like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.
720	907	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Colliding plates grind past one another about as fast as fingernails grow.
721	908	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, geologists measure such changes with great precision thanks to the advent of global positioning satellites and small base stations that dot remote areas of the planet and operate unattended.
722	909	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Arrays of such instruments track the overall movement of plates.
723	910	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	From the start of the theory's acceptance, geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past and to render it in credible reconstructions.
724	911	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A famous result was Pangea -- "all the land" in Greek -- a supercontinent that some 200 million years ago held the outlines of today's continents in embryonic form.
725	913	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
726	916	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
727	917	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And in another 50 million years, he added, Los Angeles will have moved up the west coast into Alaskan waters.
728	918	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Such visualizations caught the eye of Scotese in the late 1970s when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
729	919	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He loved the challenge of the big picture, and of using his computer programs, new to such work, to speed the endless drawing and redrawing.
730	920	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	With his graduate adviser, he made detailed maps showing the past evolution of the continents.
731	921	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And he toyed with their future shapes.

733	923	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
734	924	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"I said, 'Hold on, how could I possibly project that far?"'
735	925	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	he recalled.
736	926	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But being a rash graduate student in need of extra change, I decided to give it a try."
737	927	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
738	928	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Scotese drew a series of futuristic maps and, in the 1990s, found an ideal way to communicate his increasingly detailed visions of the terrestrial past and future: over the Internet.
739	929	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, Scotese's Web site, www.scotese.com, which he started in 1998, showcases his work, called the Paleomap Project.
740	930	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Teachers use his animations, and his site has won scientific awards.
741	931	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	(He aids the publishing world, too, providing Press and his co-authors with their map of the future world.)
742	932	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, some of his most ambitious efforts center on envisioning how Earth might look 250 million years from now.
743	933	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The easy part, Scotese said, is the continents.
744	934	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their masses might change shape but seldom disappear altogether because their bedrock weighs little compared with dense ocean crust.
745	935	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Continents literally float above the action.
746	936	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	So do mountains.
747	937	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Once formed, they tend to persist, disappearing only after ages of erosion wear them down.
748	938	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The difficult part, he said, is predicting the development of new subduction zones in the seabed, and in comprehending how aggressively they rearrange the land.
749	939	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to understand all the forces down there," he said.
750	940	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"There's probably some input from the mantle," the deep, hot, churning zone below the crust.
751	941	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It probably has some say on which way the plates go."
752	942	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	His long-term forecast, despite the uncertainties, portrays a distant time when the world's continents come together again to form a new supercontinent, which he calls Pangea Ultima.
753	943	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	An animated depiction of Pangea Ultima demonstrates a bold exercise in futuristic thinking.
754	944	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	First, the Mediterranean closes.
755	946	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Antarctica also moves north, shedding its icecap.
756	949	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Scotese said, the biggest tectonic change of all -- driven by a giant subduction zone -- has torn through the dark Atlantic and begun to eat up seabed, slowly closing the ocean.
757	950	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some 200 million years from now, the closure forces Newfoundland to smash into Africa and, a bit later, Brazil to ram into South Africa.
758	951	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The collisions gain force
759	953	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's more like a big donut or bagel than Pangea," Scotese noted.
760	954	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In looking for a name, "I tried Bagelea or Donutea but figured that would trivialize the whole experience.
761	955	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A friend suggested Pangea Ultima -- classy, like a fancy car.
762	956	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It implies that it's the last Pangea, which certainly isn't true, but it's the last one I'm going to come up with."
763	957	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over billions of years, the continents have split and joined repeatedly in a slow dance.
764	958	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
765	959	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	As Scotese envisioned, they can break apart and reverse course to merge again.
766	960	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.

769	963	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
770	964	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Instead of the Atlantic disappearing, they say, the Pacific might slowly vanish, sending North and South America careering into Asia.
771	966	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But he said his vision bore no special likelihood of coming true.
772	967	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"My guess," he said, "is that the Pacific should disappear."
773	969	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists, he said, know too little about the causes of plate motion to predict the dance of continents into the far future.
774	970	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But in the next few decades, he added, progress in geology is likely to lay bare Earth's inner workings and enhance the art of plate forecasting.
775	971	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Even with today's efforts, Murphy said, "all the coughing stops in class when I show a projection.

796	998	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
797	1003	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
798	1004	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
799	1006	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
800	1008	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.

813	1031	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has been shrouded in controversy since coming to power in April last year after riots destroyed dozens of businesses owned by ethnic Chinese and forced the resignation of his unpopular predecessor Snyder Rini.
814	1032	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The prime minister put on a brave front, saying he was unconcerned about the moves.

827	1051	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	When AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it put farmers at an even graver risk.
828	1052	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The bankruptcy has already caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture revenue nationwide.
829	1053	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Founded in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the seed industry through mergers and acquisitions.
830	1054	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By 1999, the company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
831	1055	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	For the past five years, ABT has been the nation's main provider of alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such as corn, soybean, wheat and other vegetables.
832	1056	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The company has also supplied the turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic facilities, and its product was even used by White House landscapers.
833	1057	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Agriculture officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's bankruptcy is having a domino effect across the country.
834	1058	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Crop farmers, who are already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic losses.
835	1059	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last two weeks.
836	1060	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider for the seed industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the smaller companies - something they had trouble doing.
837	1062	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
838	1064	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
839	1065	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who were selling their product to the Nevada-based company.
840	1066	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	One grower said that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT could still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment for the next two years.
841	1067	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Of the 13 states with contracted companies, Oregon and Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking nearly $40 million in contract compensation alone.
842	1068	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Congressmen in Wyoming and Idaho have already asked for federal assistance.
843	1069	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation wrote, ``be prepared to intervene with the appropriate emergency assistance for it will become apparent that the effects of this bankruptcy will force large numbers of seed farmers out of business.''
844	1070	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Though Wyoming farmers only lost $4.5 in contract money, the state will eventually require nearly $20 million to help stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT fiasco, according to state officials.
845	1071	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Finding it too costly to wait for federal decisions to be made, the Wyoming State legislature intends to pass it's own emergency relief bill by the end of the week.
846	1072	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Bankruptcy proceedings could give ABT an estimated $80 million in asset liquidation sales.
847	1073	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	But officials say that money will be used to pay off credit debts and other loans.
848	1074	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``I am a seed grower and the focus should not be 'poor seed grower,''' said Wyoming farmer Terry Jones.
849	1075	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``States need to deal with their local economy now so they won't have a huge, disastrous impact not just on their rural communities but on the nation as a whole.''

866	1101	APW_ENG_20070329.1672.LDC2009T13	The ad will be up for a month at a cost of $16,000 (euro12,000).
867	1102	APW_ENG_20070329.1672.LDC2009T13	Depending on the response, the department may incorporate it into fliers, posters and possibly TV ads.

937	1206	XIN_ENG_20070621.0369.LDC2009T13	Dorn was quoted as saying that Poland treats its commitment in Afghanistan as a long-term task.
938	1208	XIN_ENG_20070621.0369.LDC2009T13	Poland has sent more than 1,000 troops as part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
939	1209	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	Israel to launch Olmert corruption probe: TV
940	1211	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	Attorney General Menahem Mazuz is expected to announce the probe into the allegations involving a bank privatisation in the coming days after Olmert returns from an official visit to China, the channel said.
941	1212	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately possible to confirm the report with Mazuz.
942	1214	AFP_ENG_20070109.0124.LDC2009T13	That followed a recommendation by State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss -- empowered by the Knesset, or national assembly, to review government policies and operations -- for Mazuz to open a criminal investigation into the affair.

945	1219	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Clintons Report Earning $109 Million Since 2000
946	1220	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
947	1221	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax returns released by the campaign late Friday.
948	1223	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	He's also raked in $29.6 million from his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned tepid reviews.
949	1224	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
950	1225	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The documents released Friday illustrate a remarkable financial turnaround, thanks to speaking fees, lucrative book contracts and deals with a pair of businessmen who have paid more than $15 million to the former president.
951	1227	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one- page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the past three years).
952	1228	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
953	1229	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her 2002 autobiography "Living History."
954	1230	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
955	1231	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons gave more than $10 million, or about 9.5 percent of their gross income, to charity, the records show, paying more than $33.8 million in taxes.
956	1232	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to various accounts.
957	1233	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	John Kerry is the richest senator with a net worth estimated at $211 million.
958	1234	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about $3.9 million from 2000 to 2007.
959	1235	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
960	1236	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
961	1237	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
962	1238	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.
963	1239	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.
964	1240	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Uncollected interest estimates required by the Internal Revenue Service indicate the loans were substantial, possibly in excess of $100,000, according to accountants.
965	1241	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The Clintons made interest-free loans to some of their family members," said Carson.
966	1242	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The loans ... are personal
967	1243	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons are going to respect their family members' privacy."
968	1246	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The tax returns show Gupta's company paid Clinton $800,000 in the last two years, far less than the $3.3 million in payments Clinton was said to have received in an investor lawsuit.
969	1247	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Carson did not return a request for a comment about Gupta.
970	1248	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q and A: Fashion
971	1250	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I've been trying to find a large, roomy leather tote for carrying to work, but I am debating if it's really worth the back pain for such a heavy load.
972	1251	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is the large tote trend going to die down this spring?
973	1252	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
974	1253	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
975	1254	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Do you want to carry magazines, files, bottled water and gym clothes with you every day?
976	1255	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Then a big tote is essential.
977	1256	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If not, a smaller bag might be right for you.
978	1257	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	The gargantuan bag (a la Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you need a big bag I say go for it.
979	1258	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	One thing to note in the back pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their design.
980	1259	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it -- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for my back, even when empty.
981	1260	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	So it's best to buy these in person.
982	1262	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	But I'm at a loss for a replacement bag that I can wear over my shoulder and across my chest, yet still fit in my lunch, a book, my iPod, phone, etc., etc.
983	1263	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Tips?
984	1265	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I saw some great leather (or maybe they were pleather?)
985	1266	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	messenger bags at Target.
986	1267	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	They cost $30 to $40 each and were nice and roomy, with some cool, understated hardware that distinguished them from the pack.
987	1268	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'd also suggest scouring the men's furnishings dept at department stores -- they often stock more of these styles than ladies' bag departments.
988	1269	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: Four of us girls (late 20s and early 30s) are going to ... (the ballet) on a Saturday night.
989	1270	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Some of them want to get really dressed up, but I'm trying to convince them that if we show up in long dresses, we'll probably be outnumbered.
990	1271	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A( Kelly): I would advise against wearing a long dress.
991	1272	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	It's just not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.
992	1273	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I'm wearing a Nicole Miller leopard print dress to a cocktail party.
993	1274	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Would you suggest I wear a pashmina or jacket to ward off the chill?
994	1275	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Also, should my accessories be understated and neutral, like golds and browns?
995	1276	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'm also wondering about bare legs this time of year.
996	1277	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Should I wear Spanx and closed-toed shoes, or are open-toed sandals (gold) acceptable?
997	1278	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
998	1279	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	1.
999	1280	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A cropped jacket of some sort would be more chic than a pashmina, which is a perfectly acceptable but not terribly fashion-forward choice.
1000	1281	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.
1001	1282	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	2.
1002	1283	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, matte bronze or even dark burgundy would look great here.
1003	1284	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If you choose gold, make sure it's nothing too sparkly-bright.
1004	1285	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	3.
1005	1286	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
1006	1287	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	And if this weather keeps up, they'll be practical, too!
1007	1288	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I recently purchased a long, black, boyfriend-style cardigan ... (that) ends about two inches above my knee with buttons going down the front and has three-quarter-length sleeves.
1008	1289	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
1009	1290	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): You could try a dress if it's a slinky, Calvin Klein/Helmut Lang-type sheath style, cut from a thin T-shirt fabric.
1010	1291	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look lumpy under the cardigan.
1011	1292	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Alternately, I'd try wearing the cardigan as a dress on its own, or layering it over skinny jeans.
1012	1293	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital) last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.

1027	1314	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	The competition opened to both professionals and general public both at home and abroad, organizers said.
1028	1316	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	"We already sent invitations to some professional designers and companies but it doesn't mean that we have any bias against non- professionals," he said.

1031	1319	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	They are asked to design the costumes for medal/ flower bearer (ladies), presenter usher (ladies), athlete escort (ladies) and flag bear (men).

1034	1322	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua)
1035	1323	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Major global news media have continued to give prominence to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which closed here on Sunday.
1036	1325	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Jiji said the amendment of the party's constitution showed China is going to adjust its economic-growth-orientated policy, focus on building a harmonious society, pursue a sustainable and stable economic growth, narrow the gap between the rich and poor, better protect the environment and make its people more affluent.
1037	1326	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Kyodo said raising the ratio in competitive elections to over eight percent in the preliminary election of the Central Committee has shown democracy within the party.
1038	1328	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The "scientific outlook on development" values rational thinking.
1039	1329	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	At it's core is putting people first and a basic requirement is balanced and sustainable development, the Yonhap report said.
1040	1330	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This outlook aims to serve the people, to work for their well- being, and calls for development that benefits the people and is based on the notion that the fruits of growth should be shared by all, Yonhap said.
1041	1331	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The outlook would be combined with the theory of building a harmonious society, which strives to solve problems such as the urban-rural gap, the rich-poor gap and unbalanced development and gives priority to environmental protection, Yonhap said.
1042	1332	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP) ran updated stories on the election of the new Central Committee and the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, as well as the conclusion of the congress.
1043	1333	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP said the result will determine how strong the leadership is "as it tries to ease tensions over a wide rich-poor gap at home and manage China's rising clout abroad."
1044	1334	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP also reported that a revision to the party's constitution endorses "the scientific outlook on development," calling for increased social spending to help farmers and urban workers whose living standards have not risen as fast as many other Chinese.
1045	1335	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Reuters said that the "scientific outlook of development" aims to "divert more prosperity to backward villages and poor workers" and to clean up fouled skies and waterways.
1046	1336	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) also reported on the conclusion of the Congress and the insertion of the Scientific Outlook on Development into the party constitution.
1047	1337	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The report cited General Secretary Hu Jintao as saying: "The scientific outlook on development takes development as its essence, putting people first as its core, and comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement."
1048	1338	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The scientific outlook on development requires China to move towards more sustainable growth and create a "harmonious society" by reducing the economic inequalities that have resulted from the economic developments, the DPA report said.
1049	1339	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The China Press newspaper, published in the United States, covered at length the closing of the 17th CPC National Congress.
1050	1340	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	An editorial of the paper said people's livelihood has become "the core of China's future development."
1051	1341	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	In Hu's report, China's economic growth was for the first time expressed in per capita terms rather than overall economic growth.
1052	1342	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This was a sign that the focus of economic growth is not only on strengthening the economy, but more importantly on enriching the whole population and that any development must benefit the general public.
1053	1343	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	"This is a strategic shift in China's outlook on development," the paper said.

1055	1346	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	A series of powerful tornadoes tore across the United States late Saturday, killing at least 21 people and shattering homes and businesses, officials and media said.
1056	1348	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Numerous tornadoes touched down in the evening hours as the storms ripped across Oklahoma at 35-45 miles per hour (55-70 kmh), killing seven in the area near Picher, Oklahoma, the state department of emergency management said.
1057	1349	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Some 150 people were injured.
1058	1350	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The high winds ripped roofs off houses, and other homes were crushed to kindling as the storms downed power lines, utility poles and trees.
1059	1351	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"In some cases, only a home's concrete slab remains," the state said in a statement.
1060	1354	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all of the other Oklahoma communities that have been impacted by the latest wave of severe weather," Henry told CNN.
1061	1355	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	National Guard troops were called to shut off access to Picher.
1062	1356	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The state said that about 6,300 homes and businesses were without electric power, including 3,000 near Tulsa.
1063	1357	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The storms barrelled eastward and killed one person in the Southeastern state of Georgia in the early morning hours of Sunday, that state's emergency management agency said.
1064	1358	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The small town of Kite, with some 1,000 residents, was apparently devastated.
1065	1360	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"It experienced significant damage."
1066	1361	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"Many roads are still blocked and impassable," she said.
1067	1362	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"They're having problems with trees in the road, so these are very preliminary estimates, but the town of Kite sustained significant, significant damage."
1068	1363	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Janak could not confirm whether the storm had spawned any tornadoes.
1069	1364	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"The National Weather Service will have to send out a survey team to determine that for sure," she said.
1070	1366	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	In February, a string of storms brought rare winter tornadoes to the Southern states of Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky and Alabama, killing 55 and injuring hundreds.

1072	1368	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	EL SEGUNDO, Calif.
1073	1369	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The expected return of Lamar Odom to the Lakers' starting lineup Friday will send one of his teammates to the bench, and the smart money seems to be on forward Luke Walton.
1074	1370	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Barring any last-minute setbacks, Odom, who underwent shoulder surgery in May, will play Friday.
1075	1371	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Last season, Odom partnered with Walton in the starting frontcourt, but that could change now.
1076	1372	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I know, but you don't," coach Phil Jackson said after practice Wednesday afternoon.
1077	1373	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	In response to separate questions, however, Jackson said Walton would "be really good to help that second team, too" and praised the effort of Ronny Turiaf, who has started each of the first four games.
1078	1374	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"There's some things Ronny is doing that are very good," Jackson said.
1079	1375	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"His energy is good.
1080	1376	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Sustaining it is not easy for him.
1081	1377	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It's a lot of work, and he's not in the kind of condition yet that he can sustain that, so it's great to have Lamar coming back, who can come in and play a couple different positions."
1082	1378	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson did indicate that Odom would start, rather than ease his way back into the lineup as a reserve.
1083	1379	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Walton, a reserve in his first three seasons, started all 60 games in which he appeared last season.
1084	1380	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom, who led the Lakers in rebounding last season and was second in points and assists per game, went though his most physical practice to date and pronounced himself ready to return to game action.
1085	1381	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom said he didn't fear that the shoulder would impact him physically and wasn't concerned that he would think about it while on the court.
1086	1382	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I go all out," Odom said.
1087	1383	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's how I play.
1088	1385	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Just go out there.
1089	1386	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	We're athletes, so we have to play in pain sometimes.
1090	1387	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It took me some time to come back from this injury but I feel like I'm ready."
1091	1388	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	WALKING WOUNDED: Kwame Brown (right-heel bursitis) and Maurice Evans (lower-back pain) did not practice.
1092	1389	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Evans is unlikely to play Friday and Brown's status remains day to day, Jackson said.
1093	1390	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Brown received electronic-stimulation treatment near the end of practice, then hobbled off the court.
1094	1391	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	DECISION TIME FOR JACKSON: Still uncertain is whether Jackson will return beyond this season.
1095	1392	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The Lakers have a standing contract extension on the table, and Jackson said he will make his decision soon.
1096	1393	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"It will probably be before Thanksgiving, or around Thanksgiving time," Jackson said.
1097	1394	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's a good time period."
1098	1395	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson has maintained that health, along with the Lakers' chances of being a championship contender, will determine his future.
1099	1396	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson periodically uses a cane to walk, five-plus months after his second hip-replacement surgery.
1100	1397	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson said "things are going very positive for me" but said he wants to see how he feels after a longer road trip before he makes a decision.
1101	1398	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I've yet to experience a two-game road trip, or something like that, to just know that I can get out of bed, get my clothes on and make it to breakfast in the morning," Jackson said.
1102	1404	XIN_ENG_20080518.0007.LDC2009T13	Under the theme "Learning from the future", the Forum will attract 1,500 people, including heads of state, business leaders and ministers from 55 countries.
1103	1405	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	INSURERS CITED AS CAUSE OF CLOGGED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY SYSTEM
1104	1406	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle- blowers.
1105	1407	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies are the source of the problem, the lawsuits say.
1106	1408	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers are forcing many people who file disability claims with them to also apply to Social Security -- even people who clearly do not qualify for the government program.
1107	1409	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially.
1108	1410	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.
1109	1411	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers say that requiring a Social Security assessment is a standard practice and that there is nothing wrong with it.
1110	1412	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice.
1111	1413	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Thus, if a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else -- like workers' compensation, a disability pension or Social Security -- the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that amount.
1112	1415	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"Anybody who is forced to come into this system, and who doesn't need to be there, is affecting someone else," said Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as an expert witness for the plaintiffs.
1113	1416	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"They're holding up cases for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in many cases are much worse off."
1114	1417	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security.
1115	1418	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old- age trust fund.
1116	1419	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work force ages, since recovery time increases with age.
1117	1420	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The number of people waiting for hearings on their claims by an administrative law judge has more than doubled since 2000, and the average wait has grown to 512 days in that time, from 258 days.
1118	1421	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration is not an active participant in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them.
1119	1422	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	THIS RESEARCH IS A JOKE
1120	1423	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don and Alleen Nilsen take humor seriously.
1121	1424	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
1122	1425	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They can tell you why a particular joke succeeds and why another falls flat.
1123	1426	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take the show The Simpsons.
1124	1427	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
1125	1428	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Their research may seem light- hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to studying science and technology.
1126	1429	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
1127	1430	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Using humor can give you power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships.
1128	1431	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	A spontaneous joke relieves tension or saves face when your presentation flops.
1129	1432	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It also can have the opposite effect.
1130	1433	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Tell the wrong joke and you alienate people and become a jerk.
1131	1434	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	(More on that later, including how to keep out of trouble.)
1132	1436	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	His students paid more attention to a funny paragraph than to a bunch of sentences.
1133	1437	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
1134	1438	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are both literature professors, and the study fit with their love of language.
1135	1439	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor
1136	1440	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
1137	1441	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.
1138	1442	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Instead of toiling in a lab, the Nilsens watch television sitcoms and rent DVD comedies.
1139	1443	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are voracious readers of anything funny.
1140	1444	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can jot down anything funny that he reads or hears.
1141	1445	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Once a year, the couple attends an academic humor conference where about 300 academics from around the world give humor presentations.
1142	1446	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting.
1143	1447	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
1144	1448	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't stop him from trying.
1145	1449	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and setting up the joke.
1146	1450	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	I get it set up really well, and then I think, 'What was it about?'
1147	1451	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	My students love to see me get caught this way."
1148	1452	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Even though he is joke-challenged, he and his wife believe the average person can learn to be funny.
1149	1454	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of humor.
1150	1455	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
1151	1456	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use," Alleen Nilsen said.
1152	1457	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor is much broader.
1153	1458	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	What is funny
1154	1459	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In their research, the Nilsens have put together 11 basic types of humor.
1155	1460	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They range from "superiority," which includes jokes that put down Congress, to "hostility," which can be perceived as hate speech, depending on the audience.
1156	1461	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Ambiguity," in which something can be understood in two or more ways, is widely used.
1157	1462	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck: Our business is picking up."
1158	1463	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes have common threads.
1159	1464	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
1160	1465	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
1161	1466	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Penicillin."
1162	1467	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean an ultimate dream.
1163	1468	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Humor pitfalls
1164	1469	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Just as humor has common threads, humor gone awry can mean trouble.
1165	1470	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
1166	1471	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
1167	1472	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.
1168	1473	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
1169	1474	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
1170	1475	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
1171	1477	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
1172	1478	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The most successful administrators were the ones who made spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments.
1173	1479	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	People who were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
1174	1480	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."

1312	1687	APW_ENG_20080819.0878.LDC2009T13	Lavrov spoke to journalists in Moscow Tuesday shortly after top officials from NATO nations met in Brussels.
1313	1688	APW_ENG_20080819.0878.LDC2009T13	They urged Russia to withdraw its forces after a brief war in Georgia and promised to bolster support for NATO hopeful Georgia.

1316	1691	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	PHILADELPHIA
1317	1692	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	His white helmet knocked askew, Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby slowly skidded on his back toward the Philadelphia Flyers' goal, picking up snow on the seat of his pants.
1318	1693	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	He, and his team, did not look so invincible Thursday.
1319	1694	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Facing elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers rediscovered the ferocity they had displayed in the first two rounds, scoring three first-period goals and then holding off Pittsburgh, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 19,972 at Wachovia Center.
1320	1695	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the difference," Crosby said.
1321	1696	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	After scoring one goal on nine power-play chances in the first three games of the series, all won by the Penguins, Philadelphia scored two power-play goals and avoided being swept from the Eastern Conference finals.
1322	1697	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Game 5 is scheduled for Sunday in Pittsburgh.
1323	1698	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Philadelphia goaltender Martin Biron stopped 36 of 38 shots against the Penguins, who had won 11 of their first 12 playoff games.
1324	1700	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to seal the victory.
1325	1701	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	It was the second goal of the game for Lupul.
1326	1702	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
1327	1703	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval, the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
1328	1704	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh penalty box.
1329	1705	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' other elite center.
1330	1706	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Stevens juggled his line combinations, placing Richards on his stagnant top line, which includes Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell.
1331	1707	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Vinny Prospal centered a line with R.J. Umberger and Lupul.
1332	1708	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere said he and Richards had chemistry on the power play throughout the year.
1333	1709	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I thought, wow, maybe that could work five-on-five," Briere said.
1334	1710	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"So I was excited and enthusiastic about the idea."
1335	1711	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Thirty seconds after a tripping penalty on Briere ended early in the first period, Lupul stormed into the Penguins' zone and took a slap shot at goaltender Marc-Andr?
1336	1712	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury before he reached the face-off circle.
1337	1713	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh defenseman Hal Gill.
1338	1714	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury flinched his left shoulder to try to stop the shot, but the puck went in 8:27 into the first.
1339	1715	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The crowd howled when Briere, pounded by the Penguins in the series, was tripped by defenseman Sergei Gonchar, and Gonchar was called for a penalty.
1340	1716	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers scored on the power play, when Briere swept in the rebound of a slap shot by defenseman Randy Jones at 11:48.
1341	1717	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere reached the puck before Gill and knocked in his ninth playoff goal as Gill was knocking him to the ice.
1342	1718	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I think we had a tough time containing them in front," Staal said.
1343	1719	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They're strong players."
1344	1720	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Pittsburgh defenseman Brooks Orpik picked up a roughing penalty late in the first, and Jeff Carter scored a power-play goal with 1:10 left in the period by flicking in the rebound of a hard shot by Umberger, making the score 3-0.
1345	1721	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	At the midway point of the first period, the Flyers had been outshot by the Penguins, 11-4.
1346	1722	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Philadelphia ended the period with a 17-13 edge in shots.
1347	1723	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers had eight shots through the first two periods of a 4-1 loss in Game 3 on Tuesday.
1348	1724	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they've got offensive power," Biron said.
1349	1725	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they can come up and score any time in the game.
1350	1726	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	To have played the way we played in the first period really gave us a chance to be ready for their two goals in the third period.
1351	1727	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	That gave us a cushion."

1383	1776	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Video pulled off YouTube after U.S. Navy complaint
1384	1777	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
1385	1778	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	A video clip shot by sailors aboard U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan has been pulled off the YouTube video sharing website after Navy officials complained it might compromise security, a report said Saturday.
1386	1779	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The video, apparently shot by sailors based at a naval base in California, has caused one sailor to be "counseled" and the ship's captain to be called to the Pentagon to review security procedures, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
1387	1781	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Titled "Women of CVN 76: 'That Don't Impress Me Much'," the four- minute clip had been viewed 31,000 times before it was pulled off the popular website, apparently by the person who posted it.
1388	1782	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	CVN 76 is the Navy's call-sign for the aircraft carrier, which is longer than the height of the Empire State Building and home to 5,500 sailors.
1389	1783	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	A Navy spokesman in San Diego told the paper that the video " was a lighthearted and positive description of women officers and sailors aboard aircraft carriers and in Navy squadrons."
1390	1784	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Charlie Brown said the Navy was concerned that the video producers exercised a "lack of propriety" in a few scenes involving sailors dancing and lip- synching with safety equipment.
1391	1785	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	One of the scenes showed a sailor dancing to the ditty dressed in a full-body radiation suit, and also showed the doors to the Reagan's nuclear power plant.
1392	1787	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Navy regulations strictly forbid the dissemination of photos of anything related to the ship's nuclear propulsion gear.
1393	1788	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Brown said the ship's captain was summoned to a Pentagon meeting about the video, and the sailor who produced the video was counseled.
1394	1789	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	According to the report, the sailor who posted the video was not identified, but his YouTube page also features videos of Naval aviators based in California's Ventura County that frequently are stationed on board the Reagan.
1395	1795	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	That suggested the tape was made before the assassination.
1396	1796	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's comments offered an unusually direct attack on Israel, stepping up al-Qaida's attempts to use the Israeli-Arab conflict to rally supporters.
1397	1799	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"We will not recognize even one inch for Jews in the land of Palestine as other Muslim leaders have," bin Laden said.
1398	1800	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In Iraq, a number of Sunni Arab tribes in western Anbar province have formed a coalition fighting al-Qaida-linked insurgents that U.S. officials credit for deeply reducing violence in the province.
1399	1801	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has been working to form similar "Awakening Councils" in other areas of Iraq.
1400	1802	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunni Arabs who have joined the Awakening Councils "have betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people.
1401	1803	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	They will suffer in life and in the afterlife."
1402	1805	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"It also reminds us that the mission to defeat al-Qaida in Iraq is critically important and must succeed," Fratto said.
1403	1807	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	And we stand with them."
1404	1809	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Petraeus said al-Qaida attaches "enormous importance" to "these tribes that have turned against them, and to the general sense that Sunni Arab communities have rejected them more and more around Iraq."
1405	1810	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al- Qaida, he said.
1406	1812	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"The most evil of the traitors are those who trade away their religion for the sake of their mortal life," bin Laden said.
1407	1816	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Besides the Awakening Councils, some Sunni insurgent groups that continue to fight the Americans have rejected the Islamic State.
1408	1817	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunnis should pledge their allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the little known "emir" or leader of the Islamic State of Iraq.
1409	1819	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Failure to give allegiance to the emir after he has been endorsed leads to great evils," bin Laden warned.
1410	1820	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Emir Abu Omar would rather have his neck severed than betray the Muslims ... Emir Abu Omar and his brothers are not one of those who accept compromise or meeting the enemy halfway."
1411	1821	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The authenticity of the tape could not be independently confirmed.
1412	1822	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	But the voice resembled that of bin Laden.
1413	1823	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, issues the group's messages.
1414	1824	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing any tapes.
1415	1825	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years.
1416	1826	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The other messages this year have been audiotapes.
1417	1828	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	He took a conciliatory stance, chiding even al-Qaida's followers for being too "extremist" in their positions toward other insurgents.
1418	1829	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec. 16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti- Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone cooperating with the Americans.
1419	1835	AFP_ENG_20070611.0604.LDC2009T13	"He brings ANZ considerable experience of the Asian marketplace and a strong commercial banking background," Goode added.

1424	1842	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Investors loved it.
1425	1843	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Central bankers worried about it.
1426	1844	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
1427	1845	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
1428	1847	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
1429	1848	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The markets have now had a real-world look at what happens when that edifice of debt unravels.
1430	1849	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
1431	1850	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
1432	1852	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"These are trades that everybody in our business knew were going to come unstuck."
1433	1853	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much over."
1434	1854	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
1435	1857	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
1436	1859	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.
1437	1861	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But the volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it does, "the carry trade will resume."
1438	1863	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.

1457	1899	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Rescuers dug through the muddy wreckage of collapsed clay houses in northwest Iraq on Wednesday, uncovering at least 200 bodies from suicide truck bombings the U.S. military blamed on al-Qaida.
1458	1900	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The victims were members of a small Kurdish sect -- the Yazidis -- sometimes attacked by Muslim extremists who consider them infidels.
1459	1901	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Four suicide truck bombers struck nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, killing more people than any other concerted attack since Nov. 23, when 215 people were killed by mortar fire and five car bombs in Baghdad's Shiite Muslim enclave of Sadr City.
1460	1902	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was most vicious attack yet against the Yazidis, an ancient religious community in the region.
1461	1905	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	He said the casualty tolls were expected to rise.
1462	1906	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We are still digging with our hands and shovels because we can't use cranes because many of the houses were built of clay," Qassim said.
1463	1907	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We are expecting to reach the final death toll tomorrow or day after tomorrow as we are getting only pieces of bodies."
1464	1910	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We're continuing to investigate, and we'll learn more in the coming days."
1465	1911	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The bombings came as extremists staged other bold attacks on Tuesday: leveling a key bridge outside Baghdad and abducting five officials from an Oil Ministry compound in the capital in a raid using gunmen dressed as security officers.
1466	1912	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Nine U.S. soldiers also were reported killed, including five in a helicopter crash.
1467	1917	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was unclear whether that projection would hold, after Tuesday's staggering death tolls.
1468	1918	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Arab League also issued condolences Wednesday, in a statement saying "the best way out of this circle of violence is to go ahead with steady steps toward national reconciliation."
1469	1919	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials believe extremists are attempting to regroup across northern Iraq after being driven from strongholds in and around Baghdad, and commanders have warned they expected Sunni insurgents to step up attacks in a bid to upstage the report.
1470	1920	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Yazidis comprise a primarily Kurdish religious sect with ancient roots, that worships an angel figure considered to be the devil by some Muslims and Christians.
1471	1921	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Yazidis, who don't believe in hell or evil, deny that.
1472	1922	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Islamic State in Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, distributed leaflets a week ago warning residents near the scene of Tuesday's bombings that an attack was imminent because Yazidis are "anti- Islamic."
1473	1923	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The sect has been under fire since some members stoned a Yazidi teenager to death in April.

1475	1926	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Its authenticity could not be independently verified, but recent attacks on Yazidis have been blamed on al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents seeking revenge.

1483	1939	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military issued another statement Wednesday putting the death toll in the Yazidi bombings at 60.

1536	2007	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	A chapter on Australia in the report on global impacts warns that coral bleaching in the Barrier Reef is likely to become an annual occurrence by as early as 2030 due to warmer, more acidic seas.
1537	2008	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Bleaching occurs when the plant-like organisms that make up coral die and leave behind the white limestone skeleton of the reef.

1546	2027	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't say scared.
1547	2028	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
1548	2031	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The dream was about to end.
1549	2032	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr did not make another 3-pointer, and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult 72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
1550	2034	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	For most of the game, he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the Tennessee defense.
1551	2035	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by spreading out the Volunteers on defense.
1552	2036	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Tennessee big men were stuck outside trying to help on screens being set for Carr.
1553	2037	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
1554	2038	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's a race to the boards."
1555	2039	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The difference in the game was a two-minute stretch that ended with about four minutes left in the second half and with Tennessee holding a comfortable lead.
1556	2041	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said.
1557	2042	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I turned it into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him.
1558	2043	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	I wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
1559	2044	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for Tennessee.
1560	2045	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a 3 down," Carr said.
1561	2046	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
1562	2047	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Volunteers took a 63-53 lead as American managed just one field goal over its next nine possessions.
1563	2048	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Smith finished with 19 points to lead Tennessee.
1564	2050	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
1565	2051	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31 free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.
1566	2052	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Chris Lofton, Tennessee's leading scorer (16.1 points), was only 1 of 7 from the field.
1567	2053	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament.
1568	2054	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Simon was averaging 7.2 points.
1569	2055	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl came to his postgame television interview on the floor still wiping the sweat from his brow.
1570	2056	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Most expected his team to have an easy time of it.
1571	2057	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference regular-season championship and was briefly ranked No. 1.
1572	2058	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Now, there is some question how fit the Volunteers will be Sunday against seventh-seeded Butler, which defeated South Alabama, 81-61.
1573	2059	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did not show any discouragement afterward.
1574	2060	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"This is the NCAA tournament," Pearl said, "and no matter how we try and prepare you guys to understand that this is what it is, this is what you get, you just think that we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way."

1576	2063	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning Sunday afternoon for ships operating in seas south and southeast of Taiwan as Tropical Storm Hagupit intensified into a typhoon and headed northwest toward the southern tip of Taiwan.
1577	2065	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	They said that Hagupit, which has a radius of 250 km, was moving northwest at a speed of 21 kph and is likely to change direction slightly toward west- northwest.
1578	2066	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	It had maximum sustained winds of 118.8 kph near the center, with gusts reaching 154.8 kph.
1579	2067	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The meteorologists also said that the CWB will not rule out the possibility of issuing a land warning soon for Typhoon Hagupit to alert residents in southern Taiwan.
1580	2069	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The CWB urged people in southern Taiwan to prepare enough food and water for seven days and avoid going outdoors unless absolutely necessary in the next few days.
1581	2070	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The storm was first spotted Sept. 14 as a tropical disturbance northeast of Guam.
1582	2072	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	The tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later and given the name Hagupit.
1583	2073	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	It further intensified into a severe tropical storm Sept. 20 and became a typhoon a day later.

1643	2164	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The family of Mohamed Mamduh Abdel Aziz, who had been arrested for theft, have filed a complaint against the police, claiming they tortured their son to death, the source said.
1644	2165	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The boy died at Mansura hospital, where he was brought four days earlier after police released him.
1645	2166	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The source said the boy had lost consciousness during his six days in police detention, apparently after being violently beaten.
1646	2168	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The report was based on individual testimonies, legal cases and medical and autopsy reports and included 26 cases of police torture recorded this year alone, which resulted in three deaths.
1647	2169	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	According to London-based Amnesty International, torture in detention is systematic in Egypt and, in the majority of cases, the perpetrators are not brought to justice.
1648	2172	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	Cold front to bring showers to most parts of Taiwan
1649	2174	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	A cold front will drape over Taiwan for about three days beginning Monday, bringing showers to northern, northeastern and eastern Taiwan and causing temperatures in most parts of Taiwan to drop slightly, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted in a weather forecast Sunday.
1650	2175	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	CWB meteorologists said that as a result of the cold air mass, the northern, northeastern and eastern regions of Taiwan, as well as the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, will see slightly cooler weather in the next three days, with temperatures slipping to between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius.

1664	2196	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In the workplace, social settings, and family situations, effective communication is key to productive relationships.
1665	2197	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But different personality types communicate in different ways, often causing communication breakdowns when opposing styles clash.

1670	2203	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The benefit is improved personal and professional relationships, enabling managers to delegate more effectively, bosses to better motivate their employees, coworkers and family members to interact more harmoniously, and people with very different personalities to quickly establish rapport.
1671	2205	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's about being aware of behavior that will be counterproductive in an interaction with the other person.
1672	2206	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	You just modify your behavior in the name of better interpersonal interaction."
1673	2209	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The one-day program teaches participants to watch for behavioral clues - such as energy level, pace of speech, sentence structure, body language, and word choices - that hint at a person's personality and communication style.
1674	2210	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some people are harder to read than others, and no one clue is foolproof.
1675	2211	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	So participants are taught to treat the clues as a "working hypothesis" that will evolve with future interactions.
1676	2212	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who speaks in long, complex sentences and focuses on future possibilities, for example, is probably intuitive, a description based on the Jungian model of personality types.
1677	2213	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	When dealing with such a person, emphasize the larger picture and avoid too many details.
1678	2214	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who talks in short, concise sentences responds precisely to what is said, and uses down-to- earth speech is probably a so-called sensor.
1679	2215	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Sensors are best reached by avoiding theories and stressing concrete benefits.
1680	2216	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In many ways, consciously or not, all of us make these subtle tweaks in our communication styles all the time.

1682	2218	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	SpeedReading People aims to make this process instinctive and immediate, so we don't reach a point of exasperation before realizing that our method of communicating is at odds with someone else's.

1685	2222	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That can lead to what Garrison, of Vertex, calls "unconscious incompetence," or unproductive interactions that inhibit progress and workplace success.
1686	2223	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	At Vertex, which is hiring new employees at a rate of about one person per business day, innovation is critical to the company's mission of developing drugs that treat devastating diseases.
1687	2224	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That means its workers must be able to communicate effectively with each another, since poor communication impedes innovation, Garrison said.

1689	2227	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"I was having a discussion on a very high conceptual level with a person who really needed a lot more detail and a more linear progression of ideas," recalled Wilson, 39, who has worked at the company for five years.
1690	2228	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"So I essentially conveyed the same information but in a completely different way - from the details up instead of from the top down - and I think he gained a much better understanding of what I was getting at."
1691	2229	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Many other behavior-training programs focus on helping participants identify personality types, particularly their own, but few emphasize the practical application of this knowledge.

1693	2231	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some personality types are obvious.
1694	2232	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Extraverts tend to be high- energy, outgoing, talkative people, so it's beneficial to communicate verbally with them and keep the conversation lively.
1695	2233	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Introverts tend to be reserved, private, quiet, and introspective, so it's advantageous to communicate with them in writing first if possible and give them time to reflect.
1696	2234	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Other communication differences are more nuanced.
1697	2235	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a coworker who frequently questions your decisions, he may not simply be an aggressive jerk
1698	2236	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	he may be an intuitive thinker who loves debate and wants to understand your thought process.
1699	2237	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be assertive with him and avoid taking his remarks personally.
1700	2238	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a boss who rarely smiles and never seems to break out of work mode, she may not be socially inept
1701	2239	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	she may be a so- called sensor-judger who doesn't like to combine work and play.

1726	2272	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He gave one alcohol.
1727	2273	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He convinced them to let him take nude photos of them, and for them to take nude photos of themselves.
1728	2274	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	And when they agreed, he mailed them payments, sometimes hidden inside computer disc cases so parents would not be suspicious.
1729	2275	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He offered at least one of the boys $200 in exchange for oral sex.
1730	2276	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
1731	2278	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He's being held in the Hillsborough County Jail.
1732	2279	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal criminal complaint reveals more details about how authorities think Zimmerman victimized at least two teenagers and possibly more over several months' time.
1733	2280	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman paid two teenage boys money to pose nude and masturbate for photographs between 2006 and 2007, authorities say.
1734	2281	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	They say he took some of the photos on a Canon camera
1735	2282	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	others were sent to Zimmerman by the teens on his cell phone.
1736	2283	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman met one of the boys, a foster child, through his job.
1737	2284	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	At a first appearance hearing in the Tampa federal courthouse Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Murphy-Davis argued that Zimmerman should not be released on bail, calling him a community danger.
1738	2285	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	She said Zimmerman was so obsessed with talking to underage boys that he used his work computer to constantly ask them to send him pornography that he could sell.
1739	2286	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	In one message dated June 29, 2007, authorities say he wrote one of the teens: "If you can get a hold of a camera that you can use regularly whether it's a cell phone cam or regular digital, I could sell a few pics here and there every month and make you 100 to 200 a month in cash, or 50-80 depending on if they're just shirtless or naked."
1740	2287	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	But Zimmerman's attorney, Brian Albritton of Tampa, asked Judge Mark A. Pizzo to delay a bond hearing.
1741	2288	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He said he wanted Zimmerman's parents to be present so they can testify that their son won't skip bail if he's granted a release.
1742	2289	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	His parents have already put up their house as collateral for $120,000 bail after he was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Feb. 2, he said.
1743	2290	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He returned to the jail Monday.
1744	2291	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, formerly of Tallahassee, had been living with his parents in his hometown of Lakeland until he was picked up Monday on the federal charge.
1745	2292	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The judge agreed with Zimmerman's attorney and scheduled the bond hearing for 1:30 p.m. today.
1746	2293	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Federal marshals took custody of Zimmerman in the meantime, leading him out of the courtroom Monday evening in leg shackles.
1747	2297	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	If convicted of the federal charge, Zimmerman could get a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 15 years.
1748	2298	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He could get up to 120 years if convicted of the eight state charges.
1749	2299	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal case will be prosecuted before the state case, Murphy-Davis said.
1750	2301	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	When authorities recently arrived at Zimmerman's Tallahassee home with a search warrant, they found a DCF computer technician, Michael Hernandez, in his driveway, the complaint states.
1751	2302	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez told investigators that he had thrown Zimmerman's home computer in a Dumpster at Zimmerman's request.
1752	2303	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez also told them two days earlier he had "wiped" and reformatted Zimmerman's laptop computer at his co-worker's request.
1753	2304	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says Zimmerman admitted he was "involved in a pornography business."
1754	2305	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told investigators the first victim showed him identification stating he was 18 years old, but Zimmerman said he suspected the card was a fake.

1824	2405	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:
1825	2407	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	No matter that the law has helped boost student learning and narrow the achievement gap, that schools are more accountable, and that students who go to failing schools now have options.
1826	2408	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Not even the threatened loss of millions of dollars in federal education aid seems to worry lawmakers more intent on making political points than good public policy.
1827	2409	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Both the House and Senate passed bills that would drop Virginia from the federal education program unless the U.S. Education Department waives some requirements.
1828	2410	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The legislation directs the state Board of Education to come up with a plan for withdrawal, with one version even setting a deadline of June 30, 2009.
1829	2411	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Del.
1830	2412	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	R. Steven Landes, R-Augusta, a sponsor of the House bill, said that he hopes to clarify it so that the legislature would have to act again to sign off on any withdrawal.
1831	2413	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The bills are in conference, where one hopes that they will die as the legislature rushes to adjourn.
1832	2414	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, D, has said he won't support the measure, and the state board, while wanting more flexibility, doesn't favor a state withdrawal.
1833	2415	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	They undoubtedly are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300 million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be tolerated.
1834	2416	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the bills passed by overwhelming margins, a product of Republicans averse to f!
1835	2417	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	ederal involvement and Democrats mindful of teachers unions' opposition to No Child Left Behind.
1836	2418	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The result could produce the dubious distinction of Virginia becoming the first state to try to opt out of the landmark bill.
1837	2420	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Most notable was its ill-advised rebellion over the testing of children with limited proficiency in English.
1838	2421	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The state eventually backed down in the face of a loss of federal funds, but the reluctance to hold all students to the same standards says much about why No Child Left Behind is needed.
1839	2423	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Until No Child Left Behind came along, school districts were able to mask the low achievement of poor and minority students, there was no recourse for parents and children in failing schools, and no one was held accountable.
1840	2424	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	In passing the measures, lawmakers talked about sending a message to Washington.
1841	2425	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Too bad it's one that ignores the interests of children.

1866	2479	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups lashed out at Myanmar's military leaders for evicting cyclone refugees from relief camps and forcing them back to their isolated, storm-shattered homes.
1867	2480	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
1868	2481	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a release Saturday that hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people had also been expelled from schools, monasteries and public buildings.
1869	2483	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Another group, Refugees International, said authorities appear to be trying to get villagers back to their land to begin tending their fields and reviving agriculture.
1870	2484	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.
1871	2485	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Eight camps set up for homeless survivors in the Irrawaddy delta town of Bogalay were "totally empty" as the clear-out continued, said Teh Tai Ring of the United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- at a meeting of U.N. and private aid agency workers discussing water and sanitation issues.
1872	2486	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing."
1873	2487	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	After his statement was reported, UNICEF issued a statement saying the remarks referred to "unconfirmed reports by relief workers on the relocation of displaced people affected by" the May 2-3 storm.
1874	2488	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said the information came from a relief worker who had just returned from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he recounted his findings earlier in the day.
1875	2489	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Separately, at a church in Yangon, more than 400 cyclone victims from a delta township, Labutta, were evicted Friday following orders from authorities a day earlier.
1876	2490	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"It was a scene of sadness, despair and pain," said a church official at the Yangon Karen Baptist Home Missions in Yangon, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisal.
1877	2491	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.
1878	2492	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They have no home to go back to."
1879	2493	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young children and those with severe illnesses left the church in eleven trucks Friday morning.
1880	2494	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The authorities told church workers that the victims would first be taken to a government camp in Myaung Mya -- a mostly undamaged town in the Irrawaddy delta -- but it was not immediately clear when they would be resettled in their villages.
1881	2495	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid groups meanwhile said Myanmar's military government was hindering foreign assistance for victims of the cyclone, despite a promise to U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon to ease travel restrictions.
1882	2496	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.
1883	2497	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They said the International Red Cross was waiting for permission to send 30 foreign staffers into the delta.
1884	2498	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	An estimated 2.4 million people remain homeless and hungry after the May 2-3 cyclone hit Myanmar, also known as Burma.
1885	2499	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's government says the cyclone killed 78,000 people and left another 56,000 missing.
1886	2500	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations and then they are forced to move."
1887	2501	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	But others were being denied such aid because they had lost their government identity cards, he said.
1888	2502	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it was time for "reconstruction."
1889	2503	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Foreign aid experts disagree, arguing that many people are still in need of emergency assistance for food and shelter, as well as medical care.
1890	2504	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid workers who have reached some of the remote villages say little remains that could sustain the former residents.

1903	2522	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	Under a February 13 deal, the North was supposed to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor within 60 days -- expiring Saturday -- and to invite UN atomic inspectors back in.
1904	2524	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	"Our patience is not in infinite supply but given the kind of complexities that did arise with some of the banking issues, it is probably prudent to give this a few more days to see if the statement of February 13 is something they are going to follow through on," the State Department official said.

1923	2552	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues -- through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the election.
1924	2554	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
1925	2556	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	And so ensued a series of ongoing volleys on an issue that, until eclipsed by rising concerns over the economic meltdown, had retained national interest.
1926	2557	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
1927	2558	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Even before the economy took over as the top campaign issue, neither candidate took the initiative to bring up immigration on the trail because both actually share similar views and neither saw a clear opening to gain political muscle.
1928	2560	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State University in San Marcos.
1929	2562	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Through these attack ads, they've found a safe way to make their case on who's the best candidate for Latinos," Subervi said.
1930	2563	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"They've found a common denominator that's not offensive to the broader public."
1931	2564	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Each campaign's point person for Hispanic media accused the other's boss of being the culprit of the ad war while avoiding a direct answer on why it's being conducted only in Spanish.
1932	2566	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unlike McCain, who's only willing to tackle immigration in Spanish so he won't get burned by his party's more restrictionist base, de Jesus said, Obama shares his views in both languages.
1933	2567	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"We don't have anything to fear or hide," he said.
1934	2569	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.
1935	2570	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Their views on the economy, health care, education and national security are just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.

1937	2574	XIN_ENG_20080425.0030.LDC2009T13	The quake hit at 20:16 Jakarta time (1316 GMT) with epicenter at 231 kilometers northwest Saumlaki town, Maluku province, and 104 kilometers in depth, an official of the agency said here.
1938	2575	XIN_ENG_20080425.0030.LDC2009T13	Indonesia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity.
1939	2576	XIN_ENG_20080425.0030.LDC2009T13	The archipelagic nation was hardest hit by the earthquake- triggered Asian tsunami in December 2004 which killed an estimated 168,000 people in Aceh province.
1940	2578	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	300 evacuated
1941	2580	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	About 300 people were evacuated from homes, campgrounds and a recreational vehicle park Sunday and a helicopter was sent to rescue others after flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane Dolly.
1942	2581	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	Meteorologists said more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in the mountainous area, and flash flood watches were in effect for central and eastern New Mexico.
1943	2582	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	The Rio Ruidoso went over its banks about midnight, said Tom Schafer, Ruidoso's emergency management coordinator.
1944	2583	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	"Water's just going everywhere," Schafer said.
1945	2585	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	A dive team was also sent to rescue people from the flooded areas, he said.
1946	2586	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	He said he had no idea how many were stranded.
1947	2587	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	Earlier, four people were rescued after being trapped by rising water, but no one was seriously injured, Schafer said.
1948	2588	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	State officials estimated more than 60 homes have been damaged.
1949	2589	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	People evacuated from the Bonito Creek Campground was sent to a nearby church, he said.
1950	2590	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	Most of the 40 or so people who showed up at the Angus Hill Church of the Nazarene were campers "who just came up for a nice weekend" and were flooded out, said Sue Hutchinson, who operates a first aid clinic at the church.
1951	2591	APW_ENG_20080727.0634.LDC2009T13	Several campers said they awakened when their tents began floating down the river, Hutchinson said.
1952	2592	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	'Dreamgirls' and 'Babel' Lead the Oscar Race
1953	2593	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	We was robbed?
1954	2594	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The blogospheric fan reaction to this year's Oscar nominations included -- as always -- a flurry of what-ifs: concern for ``Dreamgirls''' lack of a Best Picture nod, for the overlooking of Sacha Baron Cohen's acting, for the absence of ``Volver'' in the Best Foreign Language Film category.
1955	2595	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Oh, the agony, the nitpicking, the sighs.
1956	2596	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But for the winners, the winners!
1957	2597	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	From A-list to obscure, Tuesday was for basking.
1958	2598	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The musical ``Dreamgirls'' led the day with eight nominations, followed by the ensemble film ``Babel'' with seven.
1959	2601	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding hands when their film's nominations were announced.
1960	2602	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And there was Jackie Earle Haley, a man whose more recent credits include titles such as ``Maniac Cop 3,'' who wept when the honor sank in.
1961	2603	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, crazy day,'' said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as Ronnie the pedophile in ``Little Children.''
1962	2604	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It started off with me pretending to sleep last night,'' he continued.
1963	2605	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
1964	2606	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	You got it!'
1965	2607	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I sat up and I just hugged her and we cried for like five minutes.
1966	2608	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
1967	2609	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Overall, the academy dug international themes and locales, and diversity -- something it has taken a hit for in the past.
1968	2610	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	As for ``Dreamgirls,'' it may have earned the most nominations, but it got snubbed for biggies -- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay.
1969	2611	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	(And let's be candid: The eight nominations include three in the same category, Original Song).
1970	2613	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In addition to Forest Whitaker, Murphy and Hudson, Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor for ``The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Djimon Hounsou for his supporting role in ``Blood Diamonds,'' putting five black actors and actresses in top categories.
1971	2614	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Commenting on the overall diversity in nominations, Deepa Mehta, director of Best Foreign Language Film nominee ``Water,'' said, ``It just shows that it's an international year, isn't it?''
1972	2615	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I think it's wonderful, because I think what the academy has done is acknowledge that there's a whole world of films out there.''
1973	2618	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Royalty, in other words, is big.
1974	2619	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was also some serious Americana -- in the form of ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' which took four major nominations (including Best Picture) for an indie film about a dysfunctional family en route to one of those truly red-white-and-blue events: a little girls' beauty pageant.
1975	2620	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Extra-thick double-fudge icing'' is how producer Peter Saraf referred to the film's Oscar success, which included nods for original screenplay and supporting actors Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
1976	2621	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris watched the announcements on TV, hands clasped together.
1977	2622	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``This is a new one,'' Faris said.
1978	2623	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``We've never been through something like this together, but it's better than going through it alone.''
1979	2625	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The directors?
1980	2627	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Fun bits from Tuesday's announcements in Beverly Hills: Meryl Streep got her 14th Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress as the witchy boss in ``The Devil Wears Prada.''
1981	2628	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Marky Mark -- okay, we should refer to him as Mark Wahlberg for this particular performance -- trumped Academy fave Jack Nicholson for a supporting nod in the star-studded cast of ``The Departed.''
1982	2629	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And ``Little Miss Sunshine's'' 10-year-old Breslin could tie Tatum O'Neal in ``Paper Moon'' for the youngest Oscar winner ever.
1983	2630	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.
1984	2631	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Then there was the choice by the academy's screenwriters to nominate ``Borat,'' a film that was all allegedly unscripted and improvised, for Best Adapted Screenplay (the film scribes are apparently very, very confident of their future job security).
1985	2632	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Speaking of job security, studio heads should perhaps consider backing anything -- anything, even a finger-painting tutorial -- that involves a combination of Clint Eastwood and Kate Winslet.
1986	2633	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Eastwood is a 10-time nominee (this year both for producing and directing ``Iwo Jima'') and a four-time winner (Best Picture and director, for both ``Million Dollar Baby'' and ``Unforgiven'').
1987	2634	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress for ``Little Children.'')
1988	2635	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining Winslet in that category are Penelope Cruz for Pedro Almodovar's ``Volver,'' Judi Dench for ``Notes on a Scandal,'' Streep and Mirren.
1989	2636	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In the Best Actor category, Whitaker is up against Leonardo DiCaprio -- who was nominated for ``Blood Diamond'' but was just as often mentioned for his role in ``The Departed'' -- Peter O'Toole (``Venus''), Ryan Gosling (``Half Nelson'') and Smith.
1990	2637	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I don't think anyone is more shocked than me,'' Gosling said Tuesday, noting that ``Half Nelson'' was a smaller film ``we didn't even expect to get distribution.''
1991	2638	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Arkin got the news that he was up for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the heroin-sniffing porn aficionado in ``Little Miss Sunshine'' while watching the sun rise over his home in New Mexico.
1992	2639	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I guess it was the role that did it,'' he said.
1993	2640	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It was a brilliant script and a brilliant character, and the minute I read the script I knew I wanted to do it.''
1994	2641	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Barraza -- who is originally from Mexico -- was one of several nominees who admitted she didn't sleep the night before.
1995	2642	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I kept thinking yes, yes, yes, and then no, no, no, like a crazy person,'' she said.
1996	2644	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I talked with Al this morning,'' said Davis Guggenheim, the film's director.
1997	2645	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``He was really happy.
1998	2646	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I asked him, 'So you're ready to go to the show?'
1999	2647	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And he said, 'I'll think about it.' ''
2000	2648	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But Guggenheim, son of the late Washington documentarian Charles Guggenheim, said sure, Al Gore will be there at the Oscars.
2001	2649	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``The thought of him going down the red carpet is really exciting,'' he said. ''
2002	2650	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	... And a billion people will see him, and that means that more people will see the movie and wake up to this very inconvenient truth.''
2003	2652	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The twosome were flying to Santa Barbara for a screening when they heard the news.
2004	2653	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	A flight attendant had earlier given the pilot a heads-up, and the pilot contacted a United Airlines representative on the ground, who monitored the Internet for the news.
2005	2655	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I'm only going to fly United from now on,'' Ewing said.

2009	2662	APW_ENG_20070303.0260.LDC2009T13	Koivuranta took bronze 8.7 seconds off the pace.
2010	2663	APW_ENG_20070303.0260.LDC2009T13	Demong is the first American to win a medal in Nordic combined at the world championships since Johnny Spillane won gold in the 7.5-kilometer sprint event at the 2003 meet in Val di Fiemme, Italy.
2011	2665	APW_ENG_20070303.0260.LDC2009T13	Demong, who had the second-fastest cross country time of 37:04.1, stood in eighth place after jumps of 89.5 and 94.5 meters and was 1:40 back of Chappuis for the cross-country race.
2012	2668	APW_ENG_20070303.0260.LDC2009T13	Kuitunen crossed the finish line in 1 hour, 29 minutes, 47.1 seconds to pick up her fourth medal of the meet.
2013	2671	APW_ENG_20070303.0260.LDC2009T13	She also captured gold in the team sprint and a bronze medal in the 1.2-kilometer sprint event.

2018	2678	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Mike VI, a 2-year old Bengal-Siberian tiger who is expected to grow to 700 pounds, was acquired in August from an animal-rescue center in Indiana.
2019	2681	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He's one charmed cat."
2020	2682	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That is a widely held view here, where football and a live tiger are seen as essential to the character of the state's flagship university.
2021	2683	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
2022	2684	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
2023	2685	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Perhaps never before have animals been so prominent on the sports landscape.
2024	2686	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age 17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger.
2025	2687	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.
2026	2688	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting.
2027	2689	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court effectively prohibited the sale of soccer shoes made from kangaroo hides.
2028	2690	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with synthetic materials for its basketballs.
2029	2691	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and the national outrage aimed at the NFL quarterback Michael Vick after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.
2030	2695	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off and given him chance to cover up his tracks," Coakley said.
2031	2697	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public attitudes appear to have changed since then.
2032	2699	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
2033	2700	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."
2034	2701	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The ban takes effect in August 2008.
2035	2702	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a campaign by animal-rights groups.
2036	2703	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.
2037	2704	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Response to the court decision has been mixed.
2038	2705	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	While animal- rights groups celebrated, officials in Australia protested, saying that kangaroos are no longer endangered and need to be culled for proper conservation.

2040	2708	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
2041	2709	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Vick, who has been suspended by the NFL and faces a possible prison sentence, has been widely criticized.
2042	2710	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Yet some observers say that Vick has been subjected to greater outrage and punishment than players who have committed violence against people in shootings, incidents of domestic violence or fatal traffic accidents.
2043	2711	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The LSU case represents perhaps PETA's most visible attempt to dissuade universities from using live mascots.
2044	2712	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU has kept live tigers since 1936.
2045	2713	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	About three dozen schools keep live mascots.
2046	2714	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too costly for appropriate care.
2047	2715	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans.
2048	2717	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Everybody was excited, then the reality of keeping a live animal on campus set in," Chapple said.
2049	2718	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"We weren't set up to handle that."
2050	2719	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates.
2051	2720	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.
2052	2722	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"As grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger.
2053	2723	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
2054	2724	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots.
2055	2725	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded habitat.
2056	2726	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That same year, the University of South Carolina ignored PETA's request that it stop using Gamecocks as a nickname, given that cockfighting is illegal in the state.
2057	2728	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.
2058	2730	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	(At the Indiana rescue facility, Mike VI shared with four other tigers a 20-foot-by
2059	2731	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	foot outdoor concrete enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G. Baker, the LSU veterinarian who is the tiger's caretaker, said in an interview.)
2060	2732	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	O'Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to preserve the exotic cats "will need to be conducted in captivity."
2061	2734	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU also plans to build an education center to inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.
2062	2735	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least LSU's initial two home games, Baker said.
2063	2736	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	First, it will attend soccer games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds.
2064	2737	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said.
2065	2738	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And no one will be allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt to make it roar, he said.
2066	2739	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field.
2067	2740	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.
2068	2741	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Referring to PETA officials, Baker said, "According to them, humans don't have the moral authority to eat, own, exhibit or experiment upon animals.
2069	2742	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	I don't share that religion."

2071	2745	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	you wonder how he's going to keep the energy up.
2072	2746	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Well, he doesn't, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
2073	2747	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Spurlock grabs your attention in the film's opening 15 minutes with a mad attack of bells and whistles and graphics and jokes.
2074	2748	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	He even displays full-on videogame graphics in which he battles Osama.
2075	2749	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	And then he settles into a calmer, more contemplative groove as the film progresses.
2076	2750	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Of course this is somewhat unavoidable since he spends the balance of movie traveling through the Middle East.
2077	2751	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	The sobering side of life is hard to ignore when you're wearing a bulletproof vest in Afghanistan.

2079	2753	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Suddenly he's struck by how dangerous a world their child will be entering.
2080	2754	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	So he sets out to make it safer by hunting down Osama.
2081	2755	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	This eventually leads to him doing things like walking through a Middle-Eastern mall asking people if they've seen Osama, and standing outside a cave in Afghanistan, yelling in, "Yoo-hoo!
2082	2756	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Osama?"
2083	2757	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Yes, modern documentary sarcasm is alive and well in Morgan Spurlock.
2084	2758	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	But so is modern humanism.
2085	2760	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Most actually consider him a major pain in the butt.
2086	2761	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Not that they're all enthusiastic about America these days, and the terrorists do have their sympathizers.
2087	2762	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	But they are comparatively few.
2088	2764	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Spurlock isn't really looking for Osama
2089	2766	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	And although "Osama" wraps up a bit too quickly, and ends a bit too obviously, the thing Spurlock finds is, for the most part, these people resemble us.

2099	2778	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	District Attorney Kate Hogan had said a more serious charge of criminal negligence was not supportable because there was not enough evidence to show the operators knew the boat would capsize.

2105	2785	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The federal board concluded last year that the boat was dangerously unstable and should have carried only a quarter of the passengers onboard.
2106	2786	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The Ethan Allen was certified to carry 48 passengers plus two crew, according to weight limits that have since been modified.
2107	2787	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	There were 48 people on the boat -- including Paris -- when it capsized, but federal investigators said the boat should not have been certified to carry that many people.
2108	2788	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The boat's passenger capacity was calculated when it was manufactured in 1966, but modifications over the years made it less stable and its capacity should have been slashed to 14 people, the NTSB reported.

2162	2866	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Josephine Donatelli, a photographer from Scotch Plains, N.J., who worked with Celebration Studios before opening her own studio, said she had received checks from Celebration that had stop- payment orders on them, and other checks that bounced.
2163	2867	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She eventually got paid, after waiting three months.

2165	2869	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	According to the suit filed by the New Jersey attorney general, Anne Milgram, the nine-year-old company "engaged in the use of unconscionable commercial practices, false promises, misrepresentations and/or the knowing concealment, suppression or omission of material facts."
2166	2871	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"As of 2005, obviously Celebration Studios knew that people were not getting their pictures, and since then they continued soliciting and taking people's money," he said, citing problems at least two years old.
2167	2872	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"People are giving them their family heirloom photographs and baby pictures, and not getting the pictures of the most important days of their lives."

2186	2899	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were here to promote "The Counterfeiters."
2187	2900	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Ruzowitzky wrote and directed and Markovics stars in the based-on-fact drama about a massive Nazi-run counterfeiting operation during World War II that used concentration camp prisoners.
2188	2901	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	.
2189	2902	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But their excitement was already evident about the possibility of winning this year's best foreign language picture Oscar - which, in fact, "The Counterfeiters" did.
2190	2903	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics and Ruzowitzky spoke of the award with mounting animation - though not enough to mar their fluent, moderately accented, English.
2191	2904	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when asked if the award had much meaning a continent away.
2192	2905	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an event."
2193	2906	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are back home," Ruzowitzky said.
2194	2908	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
2195	2909	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism, or its absence, is a central concern in "The Counterfeiters."
2196	2910	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him.
2197	2911	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's a crook, a survivor - but also a master of his trade and a man who does his best to protect his fellow workers.
2198	2912	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But by doing so, he's helping the Nazi war effort.
2199	2914	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Is Sally a hero?
2200	2915	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
2201	2916	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Neither?
2202	2917	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"No, he's not a hero," Markovics said.
2203	2918	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe in heroes - and he doesn't either.
2204	2919	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are no heroes under these conditions.
2205	2920	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There's only surviving to the next day and being able to face yourself in the mirror."
2206	2921	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism isn't the point, Ruzowitzky said of Sally.
2207	2922	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"He himself believes he has no ideals or principles.
2208	2923	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Then we find out he does have ideals.
2209	2924	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good citizen.
2210	2925	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But he definitely has them."
2211	2926	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.
2212	2927	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The printers take pride in their work because they are, in their way, artists, too.
2213	2928	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A counterfeiter is not unlike an actor or filmmaker.
2214	2929	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Each earns his income creating a version of reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
2215	2930	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of Sally.
2216	2931	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
2217	2932	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he appears in "The Counterfeiters."
2218	2933	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Bearded and amiable, he could be a professor playing hooky from MIT, a few blocks away from the Hotel Marlowe, where the interview took place.
2219	2934	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Of course I look different," he said with a smile.
2220	2935	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to be in a concentration camp."
2221	2936	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference is more than just a matter of having put on a few pounds.
2222	2937	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
2223	2938	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I always have fun playing characters not really hiding but giving the impression there's much more under the surface," Markovics said.
2224	2939	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"This always attracts me more than showing everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing.
2225	2940	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	This character especially gave me a chance to do this."
2226	2941	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The source of the movie is a memoir by Adolf Burger.
2227	2942	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger, who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his radical political views.
2228	2943	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He tried to sabotage the forgeries, risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
2229	2944	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger is played in the movie by August Diehl.
2230	2945	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
2231	2946	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In a camp, you can't do the right thing or the wrong thing.
2232	2947	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	All these different perspectives are understandable.
2233	2948	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and is the one who stands up against the Nazis.
2234	2949	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So actually we shot some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow.
2235	2950	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Why?
2236	2951	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Because in real life we can identify with his approach, which is, yeah, I'm just trying to get along, not change the world, be a human."
2237	2952	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	World War II seems very much a thing of the past to his generation, said Ruzowitzky, who's 46.
2238	2953	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's the Holocaust, rather than the war, that I think about.
2239	2954	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That's a real difference.
2240	2956	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For us, I don't know any battles.
2241	2957	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Talking about the Second World War is talking about the Nazis, talking about the Holocaust."
2242	2958	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
2243	2959	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The one hard and fast rule he had while filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's point of view.
2244	2960	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
2245	2961	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"So our master shot, which is usually in old-school filmmaking a wide shot from an objective point of view, was always following Sally - over his shoulder.
2246	2962	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	We never, ever did a shot over-shoulder of one of the Nazis.
2247	2963	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger says in the movie, 'I'd never be in the place of an SS criminal.'
2248	2964	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	My ((director of photography)) and I felt this should be true for us as well."
2249	2965	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Counterfeiters" makes clear the Nazis' evil, but that doesn't mean it fails to acknowledge the various moral complexities arising from the title characters' situation.
2250	2966	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are ways in which the World War II film it most resembles isn't one about the Holocaust but "The Bridge on the River Kwai."
2251	2968	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"That aspect is there," Ruzowitzky agreed.
2252	2969	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"If you meet Mr. Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone: whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
2253	2970	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But as soon as he starts discussing these works of art they were producing there, and how well they worked, and even the Bank of England thought they were right, his eyes light up!
2254	2971	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's so proud, because he's a printer, and this was quite an achievement for them."
2255	2972	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The response to "The Counterfeiters" (it's been sold to more than 60 countries) speaks to a greater interest in German-language films generally, Ruzowitzky said.
2256	2973	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The success of movies like 'Lives of Others' and 'Downfall' ((the 2004 release in which Bruno Ganz played Hitler)) has helped us a lot.
2257	2975	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Entertaining may be the wrong word for a concentration camp movie, but it is accessible.
2258	2976	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	You're not tortured if you go watch this movie.
2259	2977	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	I think German-language movies are quite successful these days."
2260	2978	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign- language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for "The Counterfeiters."
2261	2979	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's not just the films themselves that have won, though.
2262	2980	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?'
2263	2981	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's her Oscar as well."

2265	2983	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	China's Crackdown Wins Wide Approval From Public
2266	2985	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Here in China, people have embraced a different view
2267	2986	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	they regard Tibet as a historical part of the nation and see its sympathizers in the West as easily fooled romantics.
2268	2989	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In street conversations, Internet discussions and academic forums, most Chinese have readily embraced the government's contention that the violence resulted from a plot mounted by the Dalai Lama from his exile headquarters in India.
2269	2990	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Against that background, the Communist Party has met with broad popular approval in vowing to crack down on the rioters -- most of whose victims were Han Chinese -- and in qualifying the "impudent" Dalai Lama as a "master terror maker" who has hoodwinked the West with his appeals for peace.
2270	2993	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks are very easily influenced by their religious leader, so they are irrational compared to other types of people," he added.
2271	2994	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe any country in the world would allow anything that would destroy social order and ruin people's lives.
2272	2997	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	But actually, the reality is not like that."
2273	3000	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I believe the government is capable of resolving this situation," said a young woman walking in central Beijing on a brilliant spring afternoon.
2274	3001	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"It's not the first time this has happened."
2275	3004	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks who are connected to this conduct have to be arrested.
2276	3005	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, it is not in conformity with rule by law."
2277	3007	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Tibet!"
2278	3008	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	after a song about independence.
2279	3009	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Censorship officials huffed about how her gesture was out of place and pledged to tighten controls over foreign performers in China.
2280	3010	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Tibet Autonomous Region's local government issued an announcement after the riots saying the Dalai Lama and his followers instigated the violence "intending to break Tibet away from the motherland."
2281	3011	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Their allegation reflected China's long- standing complaint that the Dalai Lama, though he preaches limited autonomy, in fact has not abandoned his campaign to make Tibet and its 2.8 million residents fully independent from China.
2282	3012	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	For those with long memories in Beijing, that has always been the situation.
2283	3014	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The subversion campaign failed, and he was forced in 1959 to flee on horseback to India, where he has lived in exile for half a century.
2284	3015	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	It was to mark the anniversary of his dramatic flight over the Himalayas that anti-China demonstrations in Lhasa got started last Monday.
2285	3016	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	(optional add end)

2314	3066	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
2315	3067	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrats counter that McCain's event Tuesday in Des Moines shows he cannot be elected president without winning in states where he trails his rival.
2316	3068	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Republicans acknowledge that McCain is behind, but say the race is closer than the polling indicates.
2317	3070	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	A Des Moines Register poll conducted Sept. 8-10 showed Obama ahead, 52 percent to 40 percent, while a Big Ten Battleground Poll a few days later, conducted Sept. 14-17, found the rivals tied at 45 percent.
2318	3071	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks.
2319	3072	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He held a small-business round-table in Des Moines, following up on a Sept. 18 stop in Cedar Rapids with running mate Sarah Palin.
2320	3073	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	His campaign also has continued television advertising in the state at roughly the same level as Obama.
2321	3075	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	That Republican optimism comes despite voter registration trends that show Democrats have gained a more than a 100,000-person edge in Iowa.
2322	3076	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Still, the last two presidential elections were decided by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point.
2323	3078	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
2324	3079	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"They still have the time, they still have the money.
2325	3080	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	It's too early for them to bail out of Iowa," he said, noting the fairly cheap cost of advertising here.
2326	3082	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I have never seen an election that has had this many violent mood swings," he said.
2327	3083	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Six months ago we were talking about Iraq, two months ago we were talking about flooding and now we're talking about federalizing the financial system."
2328	3084	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain used the roundtable discussion to issue his latest call for dealing with the U.S. financial crisis, saying he spoke earlier in the day with Bush and urged action.
2329	3085	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He asked Treasury Department officials to use their stabilization funds to shore up money market accounts, and to purchase mortgages.
2330	3086	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Housing and mortgages are at the root of this crisis," McCain said.
2331	3087	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I urge Treasury to take action to shore up mortgage values."
2332	3088	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain aides say Iowa has made the list of competitive states he is focusing on.
2333	3089	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Iowa has seven electoral votes
2334	3090	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	it takes 270 decided in state-by-state contests to win the presidency.
2335	3091	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"John McCain views Iowa as a key battleground," said spokeswoman Wendy Riemann.
2336	3092	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"He intends to fight here until Nov. 4."
2337	3093	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Obama aides read something else into McCain's focus and argued it was simply electoral math.
2338	3094	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"It's pretty clear John McCain believes he needs Iowa to win," said spokesman Brad Anderson.
2339	3096	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He said Obama's operation was "the best presidential organization in the history of Iowa" and noted that McCain is only now creating one.
2340	3097	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"You can't catch up," Crawford said.
2341	3098	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, said McCain's problem in Iowa has less to do with organization than where he is on the issues, such as a new farm bill and incentives for alternative fuels.
2342	3099	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Both are popular throughout the Midwest, and McCain opposed both.
2343	3100	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I think he has a lot of explaining to do," Culver said.
2344	3101	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the farmers and rural Iowa in particular are going to forgive him."

2352	3110	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	The party primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the year- end legislative elections is already over, but former members of the disbanded New Tide Faction who have fallen into disfavor are still incensed about the way they were treated by the party's central leadership.
2353	3113	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Asked how they will respond if the party leadership decides to summon them to run in "tough electoral zones" where the odds are against DPP candidates, at least four of the "11 nemeses" within the DPP reacted with indifference or made sarcastic remarks.
2354	3114	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Of the 11 nemeses -- reform-minded former members of the New Tide Faction who dare to criticise the party's policies -- all but one failed to be nominated to run for a legislative seat.
2355	3116	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng had lambasted Lin a week earlier for calling former New Tide faction members defeated in the primary "opportunists."
2356	3117	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng said those who were branded as opportunists are unfit to be nominees in tough districts.
2357	3118	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	"If we lose, we will be blamed for not having enough voter support.
2358	3119	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	And if we win, the credit will go to the party central because of its successful strategy," he said.
2359	3120	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Lin Cho-shui, a former DPP legislator-at-large who resigned from the legislature in November last year over the corruption scandal involving the first family, also said the DPP should summon party members who are not opportunists, adding that Lin would be an ideal choice.
2360	3121	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Legislator Shen Fa-hui criticized the DPP leadership for conducting opinion polls for the primary in such a way as to exclude all supporters of the opposition Kuomintang and its "pan- blue alliance" partner -- the People First Party.
2361	3122	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Shen and another DPP legislator, Hsiao Bi-khim, who was the victim of a smear campaign during the party primary, both questioned why the DPP would want to summon opportunists to run against KMT nominees in the year-end election if the party leadership believes they have deviated from the DPP's core values.

2423	3212	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia, saying it could benefit from new conditions on troubled markets, reported a net profit of 2.533 billion euros (3.85 billion dollars).
2424	3213	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	This was more than the figure of 2.296 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Thomson Financial.
2425	3215	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	"In view of these results and events in 2007, Dexia is showing that it is one of these banks."
2426	3216	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia forecast average annual dividend growth of 10.0 percent and said it was recommending a 12.3-percent rise in the dividend for 2007 to 91 cents per share.
2427	3217	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Sales fell by 1.6 percent to 6.896 billion euros, which was slightly more than forecast by analysts.
2428	3218	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	But in the fourth quarter of the year, net profit fell by 25.3 percent to 587 million euros and sales by 10.0 percent to 1.695 billion euros.

2437	3235	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	FOR MANY, EMERGENCY VISIT ENDS IN DISCONNECT
2438	3236	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The vast majority of patients don't fully understand the instructions they receive from doctors when they leave the emergency department, according to a new report.
2439	3237	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Further, the vast majority of those patients weren't aware that they didn't understand.
2440	3238	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at two hospitals in southeastern Michigan.
2441	3239	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers asked patients to recall what their doctors told them about their diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency department care, and return instructions.
2442	3240	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers then compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked whether the patients thought they had fully understood the instructions.
2443	3241	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do when they left the hospital.
2444	3243	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If there's one aspect of a patient's care and instructions that I would hope they'd leave the emergency department with, it's ... what they should be doing when they get home.
2445	3244	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This means that those people are likely to have difficulty following the directions," Engel said.
2446	3246	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
2447	3247	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do when they get home.
2448	3248	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.
2449	3249	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five - of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem," she said.
2450	3250	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"They won't even say ((their comprehension is)) only very good - they'll say it's excellent."
2451	3252	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said.
2452	3254	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that patients were given handwritten discharge notes, instead of the printed, bullet-point style fact sheets that have become standard, he said, was also problematic.
2453	3255	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Still, the study exposes a vulnerability in a field that is constantly stretched because of pressure to see patients rapidly, he said.
2454	3256	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Whatever strategy people develop for a discharge procedure should be sure it includes real-time communication and an opportunity to ask questions," Bachur said, particularly in emergency departments.

2490	3315	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NO CHECKS FOR BOMBS IN CERTIFIED AIR CARGO
2491	3316	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
2492	3318	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
2493	3319	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in getting the legislation blocked.
2494	3320	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But in late July, Democrats passed the measure.
2495	3322	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey put a video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website, proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger planes."
2496	3323	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given three years under the law to develop a full inspection program, says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
2497	3325	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by hand, just like bags checked by passengers.
2498	3326	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	They said the Bush administration's decision to implement the new law with a "certified shippers" program is only a slight improvement over the current system, which allows cargo from "known shippers" to be loaded directly onto passenger planes.
2499	3327	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The only difference is that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not have to meet security standards.
2500	3329	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines up on the deck where they run it through.
2501	3330	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	That's what we want" for cargo.
2502	3331	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the TSA's procedures are finalized.
2503	3332	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the early signs, he said, show that "it will be necessary to very closely monitor how this law is implemented."
2504	3333	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline industry would even think that they could get away with anything less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto passenger planes," Markey said.
2505	3334	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.
2506	3335	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press conferences, and issued 17 news releases.
2507	3336	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He is known for using props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline cargo.
2508	3337	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the passenger airline industry had stoutly resisted any such requirement, saying it would cause delays that could jeopardize $4.3 billion per year in cargo business for air carriers.
2509	3338	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry has also long insisted that machines do not exist that can screen certain densely-packed cargo boxes.
2510	3339	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
2511	3340	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The company that makes the machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without unpacking them.
2512	3341	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to enact a law requiring such screening.
2513	3342	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Immediately after Democrats won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill passed.
2514	3344	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed Markey's proposal as part of the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act, which Bush signed Aug. 3.
2515	3345	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags" within three years.
2516	3346	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Many supporters of the bill assumed that meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either X-rayed or physically inspected.
2517	3347	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute says the TSA must require more than a simple check of a shipment's paperwork against a database of registered shippers.
2518	3348	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The law requires that if such data checks are used, they must be paired with a physical check or screening method approved by the TSA.
2519	3349	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute does not require the screening to be performed on the airport premises or specify any screening method, but lists several examples of methods that would suffice, including X-ray machines, explosive detection systems, bomb-sniffing dogs, and a physical search.
2520	3351	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He said the agency is also considering whether to require tamper-evident seals on cargo shipments.
2521	3352	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Together, such precautions would be good enough, he said.
2522	3353	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline industry, declined to comment on the new screening law.
2523	3354	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
2524	3355	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
2525	3356	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
2526	3358	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey said he is willing to give the TSA a chance to demonstrate that a "pack and seal approach" could really achieve the same level of security screening for bombs that checked luggage receives at airports, but expressed doubts.
2527	3359	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	If Congress decides that the final regulations for freight security are not truly "commensurate" with the level of security that checked bags receive, Markey said, he and other lawmakers will seek to change them.
2528	3360	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.
2529	3361	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"If the Bush administration tries to bend the law, it is going to discover that there is a new sheriff in town."

2531	3363	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
2532	3365	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The initiatives are intended to restore an authentic coffeehouse experience to the company's stores and, in turn, re-energize an ailing stock that has lost half its value in the last 15 months.
2533	3366	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow customers to see baristas making their beverage.
2534	3367	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He said the company would roll out the Swiss-made Mastrena machines to three- fourths of Starbucks stores by 2010.
2535	3368	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one cup at a time.
2536	3369	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The price was not disclosed.
2537	3370	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will roll out Clover systems in select markets.
2538	3371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz described a host of other plans: a pungent new coffee blend, a partnership with Conservation International to certify environmentally responsible whole-bean espresso products, and a rewards program for users of the Starbucks customer card.
2539	3372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Beginning in mid-April, users of the customer card will be able to customize their drinks -- with soy milk or vanilla, for example -- at no cost.
2540	3373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The announcements are intended to help Starbucks hang on to customers in the face of intensifying competition for brewed coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, which is widely introducing espresso beverages this year.
2541	3374	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This was more of a position statement.
2542	3376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	amp
2543	3377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Co. "They are saying, 'We are not going to change who we are, we are going to defend turf aggressively."'
2544	3378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters.
2545	3379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people are making unique claims about coffee and what they do," he said.
2546	3380	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"What's interesting to me is that they are not coffee roasters."
2547	3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	But Schultz tried largely to keep the focus on the company's internal challenges and future moves.
2548	3382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time the U.S. business is under pressure.
2549	3383	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	It's a character test," he said.
2550	3384	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
2551	3385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
2552	3386	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
2553	3387	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Don't believe the media hype.
2554	3388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	There's no coffee war going on.
2555	3389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
2556	3390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
2557	3391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
2558	3392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
2559	3393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis.
2560	3394	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
2561	3395	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the face of those pressures, Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago.
2562	3396	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He quickly announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least profitable Starbucks stores in the United States.
2563	3397	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He also said Starbucks would stop selling a line of breakfast sandwiches that were served warm, creating an aroma that overwhelmed that of the coffee in stores.
2564	3398	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the company's early devotion to high-quality coffee.
2565	3399	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The new coffee blend, called Pike Place Roast, is a reference to the location of the first Starbucks store.
2566	3400	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will introduce the blend in stores next month.
2567	3401	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Baristas will be directed to brew smaller batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30 minutes.
2568	3402	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
2569	3403	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
2570	3404	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community, mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will contribute to a corporate blog.
2571	3405	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Customers will also be encouraged to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with employees.
2572	3406	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
2573	3407	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
2574	3408	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
2575	3409	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
2576	3410	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The last innovation widely thought to be successful was the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
2577	3411	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz partly has his own relentless ambition to blame for the woes at Starbucks.
2578	3412	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, citing ever-larger expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity to one another and to competing coffee shops.
2579	3413	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
2580	3414	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
2581	3415	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
2582	3416	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event as early as 6 a.m.
2583	3417	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	As a barbershop quartet sang and employees dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
2584	3418	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm.
2585	3419	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks is his heart," said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was there with her husband, Bill.

2589	3424	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Wall Street's deepening fears about a spreading credit crunch sent stocks plunging again, with the Dow Jones industrials extending their series of triple-digit swings and falling more than 380 points.
2590	3426	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The announcement by BNP Paribas raised the specter of a widening impact of U.S. credit market problems Thursday.
2591	3427	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The idea that anyone -- institutions, investors, companies, individuals -- cannot get money when they need it unnerved a stock market that has suffered through weeks of volatility triggered by concerns about tight credit and bad subprime mortgages.
2592	3428	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	A move by the European Central Bank to provide more cash to money markets intensified Wall Street's angst.
2593	3429	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Although the bank's loan of more than $130 billion (euro94.69 billion) in overnight funds to banks at a low rate of 4 percent was intended to calm investors, Wall Street saw it as confirmation of the credit markets' problems.
2594	3430	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	It was the ECB's biggest injection ever.
2595	3431	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve added a larger-than-normal $24 billion (euro17.48 billion) in temporary reserves to the U.S. banking system.
2596	3432	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The concerns that arose in Europe and spilled onto Wall Street underscored the potential worldwide ramifications of an implosion of some subprime loans and perhaps also weakened arguments that strength in the global economy could help keep profit growth going in the U.S. among large companies that do business overseas.
2597	3434	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Co., adding that it shows that problems in subprime lending are, in fact, spreading into the general economy.

2599	3436	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	"All the things that had been denied up until this point are unraveling.
2600	3437	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	On top of this, retail sales were mediocre, which shows that indeed, the housing collapse is affecting the consumer."

2602	3439	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	The Fed did not soften its stance on inflation after leaving short-term interest rates unchanged Tuesday.
2603	3440	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	However, the renewed credit market concerns spurred bond traders who bet on its next move to predict that the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next month.
2604	3441	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Before Thursday, traders had bet on a 1 in 4 chance of such a cut.

2610	3447	APW_ENG_20070810.0204.LDC2009T13	Some experts have been calling for a textbook correction -- a pullback of at least 10 percent.

2649	3491	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The compound was cordoned off by U.S. soldiers.
2650	3492	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Residents said the blast from the failed attack may have ignited fuel storage tanks, but there was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.
2651	3493	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Helicopters were seen landing at the base and leaving.

2659	3501	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Police said at least 62 people died Sunday in the attack in the mostly Shiite area of New Baghdad.
2660	3502	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Scores were injured as extremists sent a bloody calling card to officials boasting that militant factions were on the run.
2661	3503	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military announced Monday that a U.S. Marine was killed two days earlier during combat operations in Anbar province, a Sunni insurgent hotspot west of the capital.
2662	3504	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The latest attacks were a sobering reminder of the huge challenges confronting any effort to rattle the well-armed and well-hidden insurgents.
2663	3505	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Just a few hours before the weekend blasts, Lt. Gen. Abboud Qanbar led reporters on a tour of the neighborhood near the marketplace and promised to "chase the terrorists out of Baghdad."
2664	3507	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Nearly 130 people were injured.
2665	3508	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Another person was killed in a car bombing Sunday in the Shiite militia stronghold of Sadr City.

2667	3512	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Sunday was by far the deadliest day since the security sweeps began last week.

2670	3515	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	But that could change as they move into more volatile sections.
2671	3517	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	U.S. soldiers pressed closer to Sadr City and the reception changed noticeably.

2678	3532	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Being shackled to a rock by your father as a 6-year-old in 98-degree heat might not be a part of a typical family vacation in the Bahamas -- but April Yvette Thompson didn't have a typical family.
2679	3533	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In "Liberty City," a powerful and compelling new one-person show now on view at off-Broadway's New York Theatre Workshop, the magnetic Thompson takes us on a tour of her girlhood in the mostly black Miami neighborhood Liberty City.
2680	3534	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Through a wonderfully varied cast of characters we are introduced to a singular clan -- and a singular period in history.
2681	3535	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Thompson embodies each person completely and seamlessly transitions from one to another, thanks to sensitive direction by co-author Jessica Blank.
2682	3536	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Never changing her casual clothes, she uses accents and mannerisms to portray her parents, her aunt Valerie, her adoptive grandmother Carolyn and herself.
2683	3537	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The audience gets to know and care about each individual through Thompson's strong, specific characterizations.
2684	3539	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Her father, Saul, is a tenacious community organizer who serves on the city council and teaches April to stand up for herself and always speak her mind.
2685	3540	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In Saul, there exists "the expectation of good," as his wife Lily says.
2686	3541	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Despite his later failings, his fight for justice is the moral center of this production.
2687	3542	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The revolutionary spirit binding Thompson's family begins to splinter when Saul is removed from the city council for demanding that corporate chains hire blacks in black neighborhoods.
2688	3543	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	He starts an affair and moves in with his girlfriend.
2689	3544	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Lily turns to a "cult church" and drags April along to knock on doors on Saturday mornings.
2690	3545	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	April's fractured family mirrors the fragmentation of the neighborhood caused by a lack of jobs and the prevalence of crack.
2691	3546	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	The simmering resentment boils over into the Miami riots of 1980 -- sparked by a not guilty verdict for four white policeman accused of beating Arthur McDuffie, a black man, to death.
2692	3547	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	These riots seem all the more terrifying as seen through April's 11 -year-old eyes as she struggles to get herself and her brother home from school through streets filled with chaos.
2693	3548	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Antje Ellerman's evocative set includes Carolyn's kitchen, Saul and Lily's living room and a tiny piece of Valerie's condo, with a backdrop of chain link fence.
2694	3549	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Behind all this is the Brotherhood Supermarket, complete with a painting of Martin Luther King.
2695	3550	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	We also get a tiny sliver of beach with a rusted shackle.
2696	3551	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	Above the stage are wide screens for Tal Yarden's projections of Liberty City skylines, archival footage of the riots and the ocean surrounding the rocky island of Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.
2697	3552	APW_ENG_20080306.0239.LDC2009T13	In that last location, Saul is teaching April about her ancestors.

2704	3561	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The company attributed the downgrade in part to last week's government proposal to nationalize private pension funds, which has greatly spooked investors, sending overall confidence in the local markets into a tailspin.
2705	3564	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The index has since rebounded slightly, but analysts attribute the recuperation to favorable investment decisions in the U.S. and Europe, rather than domestic measures.

2726	3601	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-10-25 20:23:22 UTC
2727	3602	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	The criminal investigation of New York's former police commissioner is on track to crash headlong into the Republican presidential race -- and Rudy Giuliani's final push for the nomination.
2728	3605	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Ethics questions and corruption allegations also have swirled around Kerik.
2729	3606	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president," Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly vetted his associate of nearly two decades.
2730	3607	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Such acknowledgments may not be enough for Giuliani to emerge politically unscathed as prosecutors wrap up their investigation of Kerik on multiple federal felony charges.
2731	3608	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Kerik is expected to confront the results of the investigation as early as next month -- and it is widely believed he will either be indicted or reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.
2732	3609	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should prosecutors charge Kerik and the case reach trial, Giuliani could end up being called to testify during the general election campaign.
2733	3610	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should Kerik agree to a plea deal, he could be admitting guilt on some level for activities that may have taken place while the city employed him -- and on Giuliani's watch.
2734	3611	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	At the very least, the case will be in the headlines again, especially if soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Michael Mukasey, another Giuliani friend, recuses himself from any Justice Department prosecution of Kerik.
2735	3612	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani aides play down any political implications, but they acknowledge that Kerik's woes could be a distraction during a period in which they want their candidate promoting his vision for the United States.
2736	3613	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"It will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up," said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political science professor.
2737	3614	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"And, they very well might, especially if he's the front-runner."
2738	3615	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	If Giuliani wins the nomination, Shapiro said, "the Democrats will make this an issue.
2739	3616	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	You can count on that."
2740	3617	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	So far, Kerik's troubles have not seemed to nick Giuliani's primary campaign narrative that he is a Republican who tamed a Democratic city and heroically led New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
2741	3618	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani leads other Republicans in national polls and is competing strongly in early presidential preference voting states.
2742	3619	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Rivals have stepped up criticism of him lately, and Kerik's case would give them more fodder.
2743	3620	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Opponents Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John McCain or Mike Huckabee could use Kerik to try to define Giuliani as somebody who lacks good judgment and surrounds himself with unsavory people.
2744	3621	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"This speaks to issues of ethics and corruption.
2745	3622	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	It speaks to capability and leadership," Shapiro said.
2746	3623	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"Giuliani plays up his leadership as New York City mayor, and Kerik was a part of that."

2754	3635	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Hadad Adel's remarks come two days after a stormy incident in parliament, in which media reported that a conservative deputy slapped the government's parliamentary representative, accusing him of vote buying.

2775	3677	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
2776	3678	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	2008 will be a pivotal year for both Kosovo and Bosnia.
2777	3679	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Kosovo will likely declare independence from Serbia in the next few months.
2778	3680	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If it does, the United States and most members of the European Union will recognize Kosovo, but will insist upon the establishment of an international mission similar to the United Nations Office of the High Representative in Bosnia to ensure the new state's stability.
2779	3681	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Serbia and its patron Russia will strongly oppose any move towards independence by Kosovo, but what form that opposition will take is uncertain.
2780	3682	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Contrary to some news reports, Serbia will not demand control of the Serb entity in Bosnia - or Republika Srpksa (RS) - in exchange for the loss of Kosovo.
2781	3683	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Doing so would almost certainly lead to a direct confrontation with the United States and European Union.
2782	3684	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Neither Serbia nor Russia wants that.
2783	3686	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	And despite the sentiment in some quarters for Kosovo remaining an autonomous province of Serbia, the prospects of that occurring are close to zero.
2784	3687	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	An independent Kosovo will be a weak state for many years to come, but it will not be (or allowed to be) a threat to the region.
2785	3688	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the political future of Bosnia is murky.
2786	3692	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosniaks, on the other hand, under the leadership of Haris Silajdzic, have pushed for a strong central government.
2787	3693	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The international community has tried without much success to navigate these opposing positions.
2788	3694	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	A set of amendments to the constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament.
2789	3695	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	EU-led efforts at police reform were likewise rejected in October.
2790	3696	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of national legislation easier.
2791	3697	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	These reforms essentially challenged the practice of elected representatives and government ministers of absenting themselves from key votes.
2792	3698	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	RS politicians, who frequently deployed this tactic to avoid being outvoted, interpreted these reforms as a threat to the entity and to their ethnic protections at the state level.
2793	3699	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	They provoked a crisis by demanding that the High Representative rescind his measures.
2794	3701	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
2795	3702	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains unresolved.
2796	3703	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The political situation is now fraught with uncertainty for a number of reasons.
2797	3704	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	First, the international community is anxious to end the U.N.'s Dayton mission and turn the reform effort over to the EU.
2798	3705	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
2799	3706	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	However, the events of the past six months have clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to go it alone.
2800	3707	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Second, during the past year the RS economy has grown rapidly while that of the other entity, the Bosniak-Croat Federation, has stagnated.
2801	3708	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The RS may not be hesitant about using its new economic power to push for more devolution of political power.
2802	3709	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Bosnia is at a precipice.
2803	3710	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If the international community commits itself to finishing the job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a constitutional government capable of serving all the people of Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future of the country will brighten considerably.
2804	3711	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If, however, the international community turns its back on Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next year.
2805	3712	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In view of the enormous investment that the international community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.

2816	3731	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that Zoellick had emerged as the first choice of economic ministers around the world, who have been calling for someone to overcome the bank's credibility problems among donor and recipient countries alike.
2817	3732	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	"Bob has a very strong track record working with colleagues and leaders to get results," Paulson said in an interview after word of the appointment spread.

2821	3736	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	His selection is to be officially announced by Bush on Wednesday.
2822	3737	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He plans to visit the bank and meet with its staff almost immediately, administration officials said, and the bank's 24-member board of directors is to vote on the nomination soon afterward.
2823	3738	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He faces an institution not only riven by the travails of Wolfowitz, who resigned earlier this month amid charges of favoritism, but also by major disagreements among donor nations over its future mission.

2831	3746	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Against Ottawa, Bruins' Thornton had the upper hands
2832	3747	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His name is not on the scoring summary, but Shawn Thornton left an impression in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators yesterday.
2833	3748	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Twice the burly fourth-line wing saw a teammate knocked to the ice and stepped into the offending Senator with his fists cocked, standing up for his teammate, hockey-style.
2834	3749	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates, and his coach.
2835	3750	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks.
2836	3751	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's the best time of year to play - the last 10-15 games and the playoffs, that's what you're playing for.
2837	3752	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	As a kid, no one's saying, 'It's Game 22, who wants to play for the Cup?'
2838	3753	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	when you're playing road hockey."
2839	3754	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
2840	3755	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and Thornton helped shake it loose.
2841	3757	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	A few minutes later, Thornton called Neil aside and opened up a little chat with his fists.
2842	3758	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on Reicher," said Thornton.
2843	3759	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see it because I was forechecking right away.
2844	3761	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	We're down again after ((Reich)) left, and everyone pulled up their socks again, so congrats to everyone for standing in there."
2845	3762	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period, but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded scrum.
2846	3763	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart skated slowly off the ice with his left arm hanging.
2847	3764	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton was incensed.
2848	3765	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Or maybe just pumped up.
2849	3766	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His body language betrayed his rink rage.
2850	3767	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	No time to chat, Cody Bass, say hello to my fist.
2851	3768	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I thought it was a high-stick ((on Stuart))," said Thornton.
2852	3769	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It was more reactionary than anything else.
2853	3770	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I had just come on the ice and I saw Stuart laying there.
2854	3771	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's our house and I don't want people taking liberties with one of my teammates, especially if I'm on the ice.
2855	3772	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I'm not going to let that slide."
2856	3773	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Though Stuart returned a few minutes later (he called the injury to his right arm a "stinger"), Thornton had made his point.
2857	3774	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"First of all, we know what he did to step up and protect our players because there were a couple of questionable hits there," said Bruins coach Claude Julien.
2858	3775	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"He stepped up and did his job that way.
2859	3776	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Also, what hopefully didn't go unnoticed is that he played a solid game, too.
2860	3777	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	He was good along the wall, he was skating well, he got pucks in deep, and he played a pretty good hockey game tonight.
2861	3778	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"You have a tendency to think of those guys as one-dimensional players, but he played more and more as the game went on because he was so reliable."
2862	3779	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart acknowledged the game is a little easier knowing Thornton is around.
2863	3780	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game," Stuart said.
2864	3781	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton, who has four goals and three assists in 54 games, had a slow start to the season, and missed 20 games with a foot injury, but returned in mid-December, leaner and fitter, and just as mean.
2865	3782	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's anybody in the league I haven't got my mitts off with," he said.
2866	3783	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I can take care of myself, and if that has to be done, I don't put too much thought into it.

2894	3826	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the chest to save a life.
2895	3828	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Experts hope bystanders will now be more willing to jump in and help if they see someone suddenly collapse.
2896	3829	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.
2897	3830	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
2898	3831	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
2899	3832	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
2900	3833	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.
2901	3834	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used.
2902	3835	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
2903	3836	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.
2904	3837	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But in either case, "Something is better than nothing," Sayre said.
2905	3838	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
2906	3839	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
2907	3840	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	those "unable or unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
2908	3841	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR.
2909	3842	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.
2910	3843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Sayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now -- the next update was not due until 2010 -- because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR.
2911	3844	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only will be added to CPR training.
2912	3845	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
2913	3846	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location.
2914	3847	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving.
2915	3848	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But less than a third of victims get this essential help.
2916	3849	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Dr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was "dancing in the streets" over the heart association's change even though he does not think it goes far enough.
2917	3850	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.
2918	3851	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
2919	3852	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
2920	3853	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
2921	3854	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.
2922	3855	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's not only the yuck factor."
2923	3856	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.
2924	3857	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"They love it.
2925	3860	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February.
2926	3861	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in the meantime.
2927	3862	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until paramedics arrived.
2928	3863	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
2929	3864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.
2930	3865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine," said Hjelmstad.
2931	3866	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was just fortunate enough to be there."
2932	3867	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Goodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.
2933	3868	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was lucky," he said.
2934	3869	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Had the situation been reversed, "I wouldn't have known what to do."

2948	3889	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The operators of a Utah mine at the center of a collapse that led to nine fatalities in August last year have been fined 1.6 million dollars, health and safety officials announced Thursday.
2949	3890	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said the operators of the Crandall Canyon Mine had failed to report repeated collapses at the facility which meant inspectors were unable to assess practices at the facility.
2950	3891	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Six miners were killed on August 6 when pillars propping up tunnels some 1,500 feet (450 meters) underground collapsed.
2951	3892	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Three rescue workers were killed 10 days later after a tunnel they were working in collapsed.

2957	3902	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux all posted excellent European wins, but that has been overshadowed by the fate of one Marseille fan facing an eight-year jail term following an incident at an Atletico Madrid match.
2958	3903	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	The supporter, Santos Mirasierra, is accused of inciting disorder, attacking a policemen and resisting arrest, and has been detained in Spain since the incident on October 1.

2978	3929	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	A dozen or more people were wounded in the melee when gunfire erupted as demonstrators were throwing rocks and fireworks at a phalanx of troops.
2979	3931	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence came two days after a massive car bomb killed one of the country's top intelligence officials and 12 days after another explosion struck a U.S. Embassy convoy, killing three civilians.
2980	3933	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"In these moments, our country is passing through its most difficult and dangerous times," he said.
2981	3934	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence was the latest sign of deteriorating security in a country that has been paralyzed by a political standoff between two camps, one favoring the West and the other backed by Iran and Syria, over the formation of a new government.
2982	3935	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The fighting erupted near the southern Beirut neighborhood of Ain al-Roumaneh, site of a 1975 massacre of Palestinians that helped spark a 15-year civil war in Lebanon.
2983	3938	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of demonstrators, some wearing ski masks, gathered in the streets of the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya to protest power cuts.

2989	3945	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	They tossed tires and explosives into a bonfire, set cars on fire and showered security forces with rocks.
2990	3946	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Gunfire again erupted.

2994	3950	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	In a statement, the army said it was launching an investigation to determine the identity of the shooters.
2995	3951	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Many of the demonstrators said they were loyal to Amal, one of the groups in the camp led by the Shiite militia Hezbollah and backed by Iran and Syria.

3001	3959	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-01-29 11:33:11 UTC
3002	3960	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The European Commission on Monday called for a temporary cut in EU sugar production to avoid surplus sugar stocks.
3003	3961	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The 27 EU nations should cut their sugar production by 2 million tons, or 12 percent, for the 2007-08 production year, EU Farm Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said.
3004	3962	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Part of the quota for that period will either have to counted toward the quota for the following year, or be sold for industrial use, such as bioethanol.
3005	3963	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU governments will study the proposal and decide on a new production ceiling in October, the Commission said in a statement.
3006	3964	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU reformed its sugar subsidy program in 2005, ending the dumping of cheap sugar on the world market.
3007	3965	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The reform has caused job cuts at refineries and forced many farmers out of growing sugar beet and sugar cane.
3008	3966	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Under the old system, production was supported by generous EU subsidies and import tariffs that guaranteed and inflated price for sugar.
3009	3967	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	That will now be phased out.
3010	3968	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU sugar prices are more than three times higher than the global market rate.
3011	3969	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU also pays out export subsidies to get millions of tons of sugar off its market every year.

3023	3987	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan, completed last week, envisions withdrawing two more brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, from Iraq in the first six months of 2009, the military officials said.
3024	3988	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	But that would leave 12 combat brigades in Iraq by June 2009, and while declining to be more specific, the officials made clear that the withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals' recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010, Obama's target.
3025	3990	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	They said all participants had sidestepped the details of how to reconcile Obama's timetable for withdrawing combat forces with the more extended one recommended by the generals.
3026	3991	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A transition official said that in future meetings, "the military will get a chance to articulate their preferences."
3027	3992	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	In the campaign, Obama said he would not hesitate to overrule his commanders.
3028	3993	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	By early December, however, he signaled some flexibility when he said that he still wanted combat troops out of Iraq in 16 months but that he would also listen to the recommendations of his generals.

3037	4007	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Obama apparently did not ask Gates or Mullen for specifics on withdrawals, according to people briefed on the discussions.
3038	4008	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"There was not challenging or questioning of any particular timetable," a transition official said.

3146	4175	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The casualties could have been higher if guards had not opened fire on the two attackers, one in a car followed by another in a truck, forcing them to detonate their explosives at least 50 meters (yards) from the office, police said.
3147	4177	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	It was the second suicide attack this week aimed at the KDP in that area.
3148	4178	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Monday, a suicide car bomber attacked a KDP office in another town near Mosul, which is 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and wounding 20.
3149	4179	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	In a separate attack in Mosul on Monday, suspected insurgents assassinated a local KDP official in a drive-by-shooting, police said.
3150	4180	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Across Iraq on Wednesday, 45 people died in attacks by suspected insurgents or militias, including four police officers who were killed when a suicide bomber struck a police station in Balad Ruz, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
3151	4182	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Two days earlier, a double truck-bombing killed nine U.S. soldiers in the volatile province.
3152	4183	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	An al-Qaida-linked group claimed responsibility for the attack.
3153	4184	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a funeral procession was held in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City for an Iraqi who locals said was killed in an attack by the U.S. Air Force early that morning.
3154	4185	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Associated Press Television News footage showed three large craters in the ground of the commercial area and the windows of some of its stores had been blown out.
3155	4186	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military said it was checking the report, but could not immediately confirm it.
3156	4188	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al- Sadr called the wall a "sectarian, racist and unjust" plot by the Americans to divide Iraqis.
3157	4189	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr supporters also demonstrated in Sadr City, chanting "No, no to division."
3158	4190	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Others carried a banner that read, "the building of the Baghdad wall is the beginning of Baghdad's division."
3159	4191	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's Mahdi militia has been blamed for much of the sectarian bloodshed the U.S. says the Azamiyah wall is designed to stop.
3160	4193	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	He said that if security permits, al-Sadr's followers would like to join Sunni demonstrators in Azamiyah.
3161	4194	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, apparently seeking to shore up his political support, has been trying to make overtures to the Sunni minority while distinguishing between ordinary Sunnis and extremists who target Shiites.
3162	4195	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has said al-Sadr is in neighboring Iran, despite insistence by his aides that he is in hiding in Iraq.
3163	4196	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al- Obaidi said al-Sadr was in hiding "for security reasons" and that "it is not necessary to know where he is."

3166	4203	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	Workers handling cargo at the complex near the Bayan Lepas International Airport in Penang grew suspicious when they heard hissing and "slithering sounds", the Times reported, and alerted wildlife officials.
3167	4204	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The officials found the snakes, worth an estimated 240,000 ringgit (US$68,400

3172	4209	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	PARIS
3173	4210	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
3174	4211	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
3175	4212	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
3176	4214	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
3177	4217	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.
3178	4219	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
3179	4220	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
3180	4223	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
3181	4224	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.
3182	4226	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance chiefs see looming growth, inflation risks
3183	4227	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance chiefs warned on Friday that the 15-nation bloc faced growing risks to economic growth and inflation, but insisted there was currently no threat of a recession.
3184	4230	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The US and the eurozone are certainly different in that respect."
3185	4231	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also acknowledged that "downside risks have increased" since he forecast in February that the eurozone economy would grow 1.8 percent this year.
3186	4232	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Almunia said eurozone finance ministers expected a "better scenario" than the International Monetary Fund's recently reduced forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year in the bloc.
3187	4233	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	He blamed the bleaker outlook on the current financial crisis, which he said was lasting longer than previously expected.
3188	4234	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The longer these tensions will be maintained the greater the risks are the financial market turmoil will be transmitted to the real economy," he said.
3189	4235	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"We are receiving some negative impacts in our economies."
3190	4237	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"It's going to keep us busy throughout 2008, but I advise against getting hysterical about it," he said.
3191	4238	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance ministers, who were to be joined later by counterparts from all EU countries for a two-day meeting, are struggling to come up with concrete responses to the growing threats hovering over their economy.
3192	4239	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Though under pressure to try to counter the financial crisis, deep divisions on the best strategy have so far kept the European finance ministers from taking concerted action.
3193	4241	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	While the outlook for economic growth was falling, Almunia said inflation was rising and would probably top the 2.6 percent he forecast for 2008 in February.
3194	4242	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although eurozone finance ministers were "concerned" but not "on the pessimistic side" regarding economic growth, Almunia said "we are extremely concerned on the inflation side."
3195	4243	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Inflation in the 15 eurozone countries jumped in March to 3.5 percent -- the highest level since the bloc was formed in 1999, according to official EU data earlier this week.
3196	4245	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The changes that we are now seeing seem every day more of a structural nature than just a question of short-term development," he said.
3197	4246	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although the euro's record strength helps limit the cost of dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil, it is also weighing on exports from the eurozone.
3198	4247	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	As a result, the bloc's finance chiefs are edgy about spikes in the euro's exchange rate.
3199	4249	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The recent excessive moves are an element of concern."
3200	4250	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden plans new video in advance of Sept. 11 anniversary
3201	4251	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	first video in 3 years
3202	4253	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
3203	4254	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
3204	4255	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Still, bin Laden's appearance would be significant.
3205	4256	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The al-Qaida leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004, and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his longest period without a message.
3206	4257	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
3207	4258	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black.
3208	4259	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In his past videos, bin Laden's beard was almost entirely gray with dark streaks.
3209	4260	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror messages.
3210	4261	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
3211	4262	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al- Sahab, frequently posts messages.
3212	4263	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al- Sahab.
3213	4264	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Such announcements are usually put out one to three days before the video is posted on the Web.
3214	4265	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours, before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
3215	4266	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
3216	4268	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
3217	4269	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	It's drawn to video releases."
3218	4270	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But the fact that bin Laden is delivering the message is significant, he said.
3219	4271	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
3220	4273	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
3221	4274	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would only underscore the threat the United States and other nations face from extremists.
3222	4276	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the U.S. presidential elections.
3223	4277	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
3224	4278	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.
3225	4279	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	His last audiotape was on July 1, 2006, in which he welcomed new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq succeeding the slain Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
3226	4280	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
3227	4281	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	That absence sparked widespread speculation he was ill, wounded or possibly dead.
3228	4282	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	There has been little such speculation since then.
3229	4283	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.
3230	4284	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	He is thought to be hiding in the tribal regions of western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
3231	4285	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	During bin Laden's silence, his deputy Egyptian-born Ayman al- Zawahri has been frequently issuing videos and audiotapes.
3232	4286	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri appeared in a 2006 video marking the 9-11 anniversary.
3233	4287	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	An anniversary video in 2003 showed footage of bin Laden and al- Zawahri walking through mountain paths, with voice-over messages from both leaders.

3237	4292	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON-Legislation that would strengthen the beleaguered Freedom of Information Act had all the makings of what Capitol Hill politicos call a "hotline bill."
3238	4293	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote.
3239	4294	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	More than 100 groups from across the political spectrum support it.
3240	4295	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The House approved a companion measure by a wide margin.
3241	4296	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Yet, the bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sits in limbo.
3242	4297	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The reason?
3243	4299	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that Kyl was the one who invoked a parliamentary procedure known as a "secret hold" last month to block the bill from sailing through the Senate without debate.
3244	4300	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	With just one objection, the bill went from "hotline" status to a legislative black hole.
3245	4301	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"I cannot overestimate the power of each U.S. senator," said Robert B. Dove, the former parliamentarian of the Senate.
3246	4302	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	By placing the hold on the measure, Kyl is assured that nothing passes without his support, he said.
3247	4303	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government advocates are blitzing Capitol Hill in a last- ditch effort to win approval for the measure before Congress recesses for the Fourth of July holiday-the 41st anniversary of the bill.
3248	4305	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It really illustrates how Congress has become dysfunctional."
3249	4306	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's hold on the Open Government Act eliminates majority rule in favor of the "idiosyncrasies of one individual," Aftergood said.
3250	4307	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to see how government can function this way."
3251	4308	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	So far, the open government groups -conservative and liberals included--have been unsuccessful in budging Kyl.
3252	4309	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Cornyn-Leahy bill attempts to reduce the long backlog of FOIA requests by imposing consequences for missing the 20-day statutory deadline.
3253	4310	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill establishes a FOIA hotline service to track requests and creates an ombudsman to settle disputes.
3254	4314	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	To date, McConnell has not responded to a request to allow two hours of debate on the measure.
3255	4315	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	An aide to McConnell said that the debate proposal did not permit discussion of Kyl's concerns.
3256	4316	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Until those concerns are addressed, the bill will not move.
3257	4317	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's a sad day in democracy when an open government bill does not see the light of day," said Rick Blum, director of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups.
3258	4318	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	If Kyl has concerns, those concerns should be openly debated so the bill can move forward, Blum said.
3259	4319	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's office did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment for this story.
3260	4320	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	However, Kyl did list his objections to the bill in a Senate Judiciary Committee report filed in Congress.
3261	4321	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl, a Judiciary Committee member, baffled open government groups because he objected in writing after allowing the measure to clear the committee by voice vote.
3262	4322	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Although the goals of the Open Government Act are laudable, the bill reported by the committee has a number of flaws that must be addressed," Kyl said in his dissenting opinion.
3263	4323	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.
3264	4324	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl was concerned that the provision would inadvertently release sensitive information about national security.
3265	4325	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Justice Department concurs, calling it a "Draconian remedy with enormous consequences" because it would lead to the automatic release of all information with only a few narrow exceptions.
3266	4326	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Overall, Kyl's list of concerns mirrors the Justice Department's concerns.
3267	4327	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	And Kyl objects to a provision that would allow requesters to seek attorneys fees when they challenge denials in federal court.
3268	4329	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The higher court ruled that a party suing the government is not entitled to attorney's fees if the government voluntarily changed its position and gave the plaintiff what he wanted.
3269	4330	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government groups say this is an important provision.
3270	4331	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	They have testified that agencies are routinely delaying the release of government records past the statutory 20-day deadline, forcing FOIA requesters to mount an expensive legal challenge to get the records.
3271	4332	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Some have reported that they spend thousands of dollars in legal fees only to have the government cough up the records in the 11th hour.
3272	4333	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have tried to address Kyl's concerns over the past month.
3273	4335	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have eliminated the provision that would bar agencies from asserting exemption to a FOIA request if they failed to meet the 20-day deadline set by law.
3274	4336	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Staffers for Cornyn and Leahy say they are hopeful that Kyl will ultimately support the measure.
3275	4338	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"He believes the Senate should act on this good government legislation as soon as possible."
3276	4339	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law needs to be improved, Leahy said.
3277	4340	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law is hampered by excessive delays and lax agency compliance, he said.
3278	4341	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Today, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIA's 41-year history," Leahy said.
3279	4342	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"This bill would help to reverse this trend and to restore the public's trust in their government."

3282	4346	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	More than 3,000 firefighters are trying to tame the fires that are ravaging forests in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, sources with local fire squad headquarters said on Friday.
3283	4347	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires were spotted at 10:00 a.m. Friday in the forest areas between Heihe City and Yichun City, bordering the Lesser Hinggan Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, said a provincial meteorological bureau spokesman.
3284	4348	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The two largest fires in Xunke County of Heihe City, were estimated to cover 5.5 and 6.6 square km respectively, according to earlier report.
3285	4349	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	Six helicopters have been dispatched to carry firefighters and scout for fire condition, while provincial meteorological bureau is working to induce artificial rains.
3286	4350	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires, fanned by high winds of 29 to 50 kilometers per hour, are spreading quickly.
3287	4351	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	"It is hard to make out the size of forests devoured by the blaze on satellite pictures due to clouds," an official with the meteorological bureau told Xinhua in an interview.
3288	4352	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	Severe drought hit the province this summer and the average temperature this autumn was higher than usual, posing a high fire risk to forest areas as well as the Lesser Hinggan Mountains and the Greater Hinggan Mountains, the country's largest forest zone, the bureau said.

3309	4382	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I asked him a few questions about his past, but all he told me was that he had been married, that he had children and grand- children."

3327	4423	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
3328	4424	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
3329	4425	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.
3330	4426	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee already had said the warning did not affect Hamm's spot on the team for the Beijing Games.
3331	4427	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG's announcement came a day after Hamm's twin brother, Paul, withdrew from the Olympics, saying he won't be healthy enough to defend his all-around title.
3332	4428	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Paul Hamm had a broken right hand and strained left rotator cuff.
3333	4429	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle.
3334	4430	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	After being notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
3335	4431	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USADA said it had "absolutely no concern" the shot was for anything but medicinal purposes.
3336	4432	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	As part of his punishment, Hamm's results from the second day of nationals were wiped out.
3337	4433	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm would still have made the team.

3355	4462	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
3356	4463	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The date was July 17, 2007.
3357	4464	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The football team on which Blank had lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as completely as any football team ever has.
3358	4465	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season that never ended.
3359	4466	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Every day there was another twist to the story - there was the Michael Vick story, and then there was the Bobby Petrino story.

3362	4469	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	This fire, alas, had a wickedly long tail.
3363	4470	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Within five months, Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the quarterback's singular skills.
3364	4471	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the field," the work carries no guarantee.
3365	4472	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
3366	4473	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
3367	4474	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"Clearly the answer we felt was, 'Yes.'

3369	4476	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
3370	4477	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
3371	4478	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.

3382	4490	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"A lot had been speculation up to then.

3399	4509	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	ECB chief says markets not wrong in betting on June rate hike
3400	4511	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June rate rise were correct, Trichet said: "I will not say anything to change market expectations over the next one or two months."
3401	4512	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, the Frenchman insisted that the ECB had not "pre- committed" to any pre-set timetable of interest rate moves.
3402	4513	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	The bank, known as the guardian of the euro, held its benchmark "refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent at its regular monthly policy-setting meeting on Thursday, just a month after raising them by a quarter of a percentage point to their highest level in five and a half years.
3403	4514	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi to 4.0 percent in June.
3404	4515	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Trichet said that "there was no discussion" within the ECB's policy-making governing council of possible move this month.
3405	4516	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	The decision to hold rates steady was "unanimous", he said.
3406	4517	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, even at the current level of interest rates, the ECB's monetary policy stance remained "on the accommodative side", Trichet said.
3407	4518	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	And the bank would "act in a firmly and timely manner" to safeguard price stability in the euro area, he promised.
3408	4519	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Report: Officers joked about dying immigrant in NY case
3409	4521	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Police officers were taped joking about a dying, homeless Guatemalan immigrant after he was found on the side of a deserted road in their suburban town, a television station reported.
3410	4522	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	"You wanna hear something really funny?
3411	4523	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	... He's alive," a Bedford police officer tells a sergeant on a taped phone call aired Thursday on WCBS-TV.
3412	4524	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The two go on to marvel -- with the officer chuckling -- that Rene Perez had apparently revived himself temporarily after authorities thought him dead on April 28, 2007.
3413	4525	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The television station said Perez died an hour after the officers' taped exchange.
3414	4526	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez had had a series of encounters with police in Bedford and neighboring Mount Kisco that night.
3415	4527	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A Mount Kisco police officer has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in Perez's death.
3416	4528	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say the officer drove the drunken Perez to Mount Kisco, dealt him a deadly blow to the abdomen and left him to die.
3417	4529	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	In a later phone call to another Bedford sergeant, after Perez' death, a Bedford officer sings the title line from the 1966 hit record "Walk Away Renee" by The Left Banke.
3418	4531	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He said he could not comment further on the ongoing case.
3419	4533	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Mateo called for the suspension of the officers involved.
3420	4534	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the Mount Kisco officer charged in the case, George Bubaris, did not immediately return a telephone call late Thursday.

3422	4537	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	a hearing is set for next week.
3423	4538	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez, 42, an illegal immigrant, had a history of making drunken calls to the police emergency dispatcher.
3424	4539	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He called Mount Kisco police complaining of stomach pain on April 28, and police records show Bubaris reported there was no need for further action.
3425	4540	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits filed on behalf of Perez' family maintain that Mount Kisco and Bedford made a practice of "dumping" each other's undesirables in the neighboring town.
3426	4541	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Bedford police had taken Perez into Mount Kisco hours before Bubaris allegedly took him to Bedford.
3427	4542	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Through a translator, Perez' brother, Anival Perez, called the Bedford officers' taped conversations "unrespectful."

3431	4547	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
3432	4548	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer, health researchers say.
3433	4550	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The overall prevalence was slightly higher than previous estimates.
3434	4552	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The new report, based upon a national analysis of nearly 2,000 women, was released amid a heated debate in Texas over whether 11 -year-old girls should be required to receive a vaccine that protects women from the virus.
3435	4553	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
3436	4555	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
3437	4556	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
3438	4558	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry said his goal was to protect future generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000 women a year in this country.
3439	4560	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The Texas Medical Association, too, has said the vaccine shouldn't be mandated, citing, in part, the high cost of the three-shot regimen, which starts at $360.
3440	4561	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
3441	4562	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
3442	4564	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.
3443	4565	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The earlier studies indicated that widespread use of the vaccine would save money because initial investments in the cost of the vaccine would be more than recouped by a reduction in cancer treatment expenses and eventually might increase the recommended interval between Pap smears, Stanberry said.

3470	4611	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain Moves to Soften the Tone at Rallies, if Not in Ads
3471	4613	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences with Obama.
3472	4614	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the United States.
3473	4615	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We want to fight and I want to fight, but we will be respectful," McCain said, again prompting loud boos when he declared that he admires Obama's accomplishments.
3474	4616	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"I want everyone to be respectful, and let's be sure we are.
3475	4617	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... That doesn't mean you have to reduce your ferocity.
3476	4618	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It's just got to be respectful."
3477	4619	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At one point in the event, McCain grabbed back the microphone from an elderly woman who had begun to say that she didn't like Obama because he is an Arab.
3478	4620	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"No, ma'am.
3479	4621	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	No, ma'am," McCain said.
3480	4622	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have serious differences with on fundamental questions."
3481	4623	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was mentioned.
3482	4624	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
3483	4625	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I wouldn't be running."
3484	4628	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
3485	4629	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of that relationship."
3486	4630	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At the town hall, McCain promised not to relent on tying Obama to Ayers, telling the crowd, "We'll be talking about that more."
3487	4631	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning will backfire.
3488	4632	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"They can run misleading ads.
3489	4633	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They can pursue the politics of anything goes.
3490	4634	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It will not work.
3491	4635	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Not this time," Obama said.
3492	4636	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
3493	4637	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses, a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and complement what has already been done for major financial institutions.
3494	4638	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain said the federal government should suspend rules that require seniors to begin withdrawing from their retirement accounts when they reach age 70 1/2 to allow them more times to try and recoup recent losses.
3495	4639	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on Obama's character.
3496	4642	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"ACORN is an organization that has violated the law on a repeated basis," Davis said.
3497	4643	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
3498	4644	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad, in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks, intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business."
3499	4645	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It says ACORN stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to ACORN run long and deep.
3500	4646	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... They even endorsed him for president."
3501	4647	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a lawyer.
3502	4648	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They said his work as an organizer in 1992 was not connected to the group.
3503	4650	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented challenges facing their families and our nation."
3504	4651	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
3505	4653	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter registration forms that they collect.
3506	4654	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But, in many states the law requires them to submit forms to election officials even if they contain suspect information.

3509	4658	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	A 40-year-old convicted of orchestrating and participating in the fatal stabbing and beating of a man during a 1995 robbery was executed by lethal injection Thursday in the state of Texas, officials said.
3510	4659	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Larry Davis was put to death at Huntsville Prison at 6:19 pm local time (2319 GMT), a representative of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice told AFP.
3511	4660	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis was accused of entering the Amarillo, Texas home of Michael Barrow with several conspirators and killing Barrow, who was stabbed with a knife and an ice pick and beaten with a pipe.
3512	4661	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis had proclaimed he was innocent of planning and carrying out the murder.
3513	4662	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	The execution is the third in July in the state of Texas, and the 16th in the United States since the Supreme Court in April ruled that lethal injections are constitutional.
3514	4663	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Executions across the country had been put on hold for months as the court deliberated.
3515	4664	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 16 executions are expected between now and September, including 10 more in Texas, the state that has put a record 409 people to death in the past 30 years.

3518	4678	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Patterson, a former diplomat from Costa Rica, claims to have proper ownership of the artifacts, investigators said.
3519	4680	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger said that Patterson recently arranged for the collection to be shipped from Costa Rica to Europe.
3520	4681	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	After clearing customs in Spain, the artifacts were loaded onto a caravan of semitrailers and driven to Munich.
3521	4682	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Bavarian authorities found the collection packed in more than 100 wooden crates at an undisclosed location in Munich in southern Germany.
3522	4683	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	They also found Patterson, who has been questioned by investigators but is not in police custody, said Waldinger.
3523	4684	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	He could face criminal charges if it is determined that he is not the collection's rightful owner, Waldinger said.
3524	4689	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"In the past this was not possible, we could get it at best in under a quarter of an hour to half an hour," he said.
3525	4691	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"The difference in time is really important because the challenge is to warn people away from the coastline within minutes.
3526	4692	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	It takes 10 to 20 minutes before a tsunami hits the coastline," he said.
3527	4693	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"If you have the information this soon after the earthquake hits, you could get information to hotels and villages and avert a potential disaster."

3529	4697	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	One of two components that must still be added to the detection system is a way of measuring where in the ocean a tsunami begins and where it will hit the coast.
3530	4698	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	Zschau said the software had only been installed in recent weeks and his group was "relieved" that it passed a baptism of fire in the series of powerful quakes that has struck in the Pacific around Indonesia since late Wednesday.
3531	4699	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	At least 10 people have died and some 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed, but fears that large-scale destruction mirroring the events of 2004 have so far proved unfounded.
3532	4700	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The latest quake hit off the northern tip of Sulawesi Island early on Thursday, like the earlier ones triggering a tsunami warning that was soon cancelled.

3540	4711	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	"I am very pained and ashamed for not having been honest for the past two months."
3541	4712	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Earlier Friday, Kim said he regrets that he "failed to control impulsive emotion" and apologized for causing trouble.
3542	4713	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	"I hope there will never be a silly father like me again," Kim told reporters after the court hearing.
3543	4714	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	The dramatic details of the case, which media have likened to a gangster movie, has drawn intense public interest in South Korea, where the heads of family controlled conglomerates wield great economic, political and social clout.
3544	4715	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	The younger Kim, a student at Yale University, reportedly suffered an injury that required 11 stitches in the scuffle on stairs outside the karaoke pub.
3545	4716	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	Victims have told police the elder Kim and his bodyguards took them to a mountainous area south of Seoul, where Kim himself allegedly assaulted them, including hitting one of them on the back with a 5-foot (1.5 meter) steel pipe.
3546	4717	APW_ENG_20070511.1007.LDC2009T13	They have also told police Kim later sought out another man at a bar in central Seoul and had his son beat him, according to a police statement.

3552	4729	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Iran rejects a UN Security Council resolution of December 23 which imposed limited sanctions to force it to stop enriching uranium.
3553	4730	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	ElBaradei has proposed that in simultaneous moves Iran should suspend enrichment and the United Nations should hold off on sanctions.
3554	4731	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	A diplomat close to the IAEA said European states would be seeking in Munich to use informal contacts with Larijani to get Iran "to come up with some realistic, achievable proposals" to meet the UN demands.
3555	4732	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The uranium enrichment uses centrifuges to make fuel for civilian nuclear reactors but can also be used to make material for bombs.
3556	4734	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Tehran insists its programme is peaceful.
3557	4736	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	"They might agree on some sort of framework or concept under which the Iranians will pull the plug on centrifuges for a couple of months" -- opening the door to wider talks including the United States -- and for the Security Council to take "no action for that period" on sanctions.
3558	4737	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Moscow supports ElBaradei's "time-out" proposal.
3559	4740	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	But diplomats said some European states were at least playing with the idea of a face-saving solution along the lines of a "time-out" that fudges the need for Iran to unconditionally stand-down.
3560	4741	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The Security Council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by ElBaradei later this month shows Tehran continuing to defy the Security Council, especially since Iran is pressing ahead with building an underground plant at Natanz for industrial-level uranium enrichment.

3573	4763	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Roger Federer is not lonely at No. 1.
3574	4764	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He has plenty of company off the court.
3575	4765	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	New York has been the site of Federer's three consecutive U.S. Open triumphs, and the two-week event has also given Federer a platform to meet and befriend luminaries.
3576	4766	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Anna Wintour and Tiger Woods are now only a phone call away.
3577	4768	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour threw Federer a dinner party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and invited 60 guests, including the designers Diane von Furstenberg, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta.
3578	4769	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"That was great fun," Federer said Friday in a public garden atop Niketown, before speaking to children from the City Parks tennis program.
3579	4770	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer first met Wintour at a charity event in New York.
3580	4772	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I know Anna very well," Federer said.
3581	4773	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"And then meeting the designers -- these people are a big inspiration.
3582	4774	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	I've gotten into fashion the last few years, done my own fashion statements on center court at Wimbledon."
3583	4775	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer wore a white blazer with the "RF" crest at Wimbledon, where he has won five straight titles.
3584	4776	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Anna said that was fantastic," Federer said, grinning.
3585	4777	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I think she's also excited about this outfit at the Open."
3586	4778	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wearing different styles for day and night matches, Federer is seeking to become the first man in the open era to win four straight U.S. Open titles.
3587	4779	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Lendl and John McEnroe also won three in a row.
3588	4780	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	In July, Federer tied Bjorn Borg's record of five straight Wimbledon titles.
3589	4781	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It would be nice to win four in a row, but basically I'm here to defend my title for last year," Federer said.
3590	4782	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Wimbledon was great because it was five in a row.
3591	4783	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	That was for me a really big streak."
3592	4784	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	The victory at Wimbledon gave him his 11th major title.
3593	4785	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	A month later, Woods won his 13th major title, at the PGA Championship, stoking their friendly competition to catch their sports' career leaders (Pete Sampras's 14 major titles and Jack Nicklaus's 18).
3594	4786	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Last September, Woods was in Federer's box to watch him win the U.S. Open final against Andy Roddick.
3595	4787	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Only afterward did Woods and Federer meet for the first time.
3596	4788	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I had met many sports greats, but Tiger was a logical thing because we were always talking about each other," Federer said.
3597	4789	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Now they frequently talk or text-message each other.
3598	4790	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	(Federer said he did not think that Woods, a new father, would be coming to the Open this year.)
3599	4791	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	They have seen each other play when their tournament schedules overlap, in Shanghai, Miami and Dubai, where their Gillette advertising campaign was announced in February.
3600	4792	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Watching Woods play made him feel even more of a kinship.
3601	4793	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"He does things a little bit similar to me," Federer said.
3602	4794	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Like on the golf course, you think he's serious, so focused, concentrated guy.
3603	4795	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	But then you get little hints of actually what personality he has off the golf course.
3604	4796	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	When he gets a bit angry or laughs or does a joke with other golfers.
3605	4797	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Off the court, he's so laid back, it's unbelievable."
3606	4798	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer, 26, from Basel, Switzerland, is also laid-back.
3607	4799	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He travels with a small entourage led by his longtime girlfriend, Mirka Vavrinec, who arranges his schedule in minute detail leading up to the Open.
3608	4800	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Even though he has had daily practices since arriving Tuesday, Federer said he was grateful for some down time in New York after a grueling last few weeks in North America.
3609	4803	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer avenged that loss at Wimbledon in a five-set thriller.
3610	4804	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It's good sometimes to lose," said Federer, who followed the loss in Montreal by defeating James Blake for the title in Cincinnati last week.
3611	4805	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"You start new.
3612	4806	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Like last week, people talk, people think.

3623	4821	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Presidential candidates are collecting contributions at a record- setting pace and are racing to load their schedules with fundraising events ahead of March 31, the campaign's first deadline for filing financial reports.
3624	4822	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
3625	4823	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.
3626	4825	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
3627	4826	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
3628	4827	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
3629	4828	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
3630	4829	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week.
3631	4830	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Campaigns are also aggressively trying to manage expectations, providing low-ball estimates of what they will raise while exaggerating predictions for their opponents.
3632	4831	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
3633	4833	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
3634	4836	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.
3635	4838	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
3636	4839	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''
3637	4841	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama is holding low-dollar ``kickoff'' fundraisers in cities nationwide, including a $100-per-ticket fundraiser in Denver and a $25-per-ticket event in Oklahoma City in recent days, and a $100-per-ticket event in West Palm Beach this weekend.
3638	4842	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton.
3639	4843	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
3640	4845	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
3641	4846	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama's rivals argue that his ability to hold multimillion-dollar events in New York and Los Angeles belie the campaign's claim that his is simply a grass-roots movement without major financial players.
3642	4847	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has stolen away dozens of Clinton fundraisers
3643	4848	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	hired a veteran finance director, Julianna Smoot
3644	4849	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	and signed up a talented team of Web designers at the company Blue State Digital to help power his online fundraising effort.
3645	4851	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who can roll over more than $11 million from her Senate race last year, has a huge, traditional network in place -- headed by the veteran Clinton finance guru, Terence McAuliffe -- and her husband, perhaps the party's biggest fundraising draw.
3646	4852	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, Bill Clinton hosted a 1,000-person gala at the Sheraton in New York
3647	4853	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	he also attended Tuesday night's event (minimum donation: $1,000) at the Marriott Wardman Park.
3648	4854	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In between, the former president was scheduled to attend a fundraising reception, at the home of Sheila and Jay Kaplowitz in Philadelphia.
3649	4856	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He said Hillary Clinton, like Obama, is bringing in new donors every day.
3650	4857	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	After an intimate ``friend-raising'' dinner at the home of Elaine and Gerry Schuster in Boston in February, Clinton supporters are preparing for a much larger gathering on March 30 -- just under the wire for first-quarter filing.
3651	4858	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaign has asked donors to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31 tally.
3652	4859	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Both Clinton and Obama are expected to hold fundraisers in Las Vegas later this week.
3653	4860	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In a significant change, strategists on both sides of the aisle agree, Democratic contenders could wind up with more money than their Republican counterparts.
3654	4861	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Still, GOP benchmarks exist.
3655	4863	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Early on, Romney impressed insiders by collecting more than $6 million in a single call-athon day in Boston, but one strategist said he has not heard much since from the former governor.
3656	4864	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Either he's gotten all the money he's going to get or they've got so much money they don't need any more,'' the strategist said.
3657	4865	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney is staying active on the fundraising circuit, with 20 events scheduled this month.
3658	4867	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In the national polls, we are in third place.''
3659	4868	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Giuliani may have the most to gain -- or lose -- with his first- quarter showing, and he and his inner circle of fundraisers are acting like it.
3660	4870	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Allies of McCain have argued that he got a late start on raising money.
3661	4871	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not years, before that announcement.
3662	4872	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His first major event was on March 2 in Phoenix, and was the first in a series of ``Exchange of Ideas'' fundraisers in which the crowd is allowed to question the candidate.
3663	4873	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
3664	4874	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Bush, an incumbent running without significant primary opposition, raised $36 million in the first six months of 2003.
3665	4875	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His campaign began fundraising in earnest only in early March.

3746	4960	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The regulator said that under the settlement's terms, Citigroup has agreed to effectively buy back 7.4 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it marketed to tens of thousands of customers.
3747	4961	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The deal also requires Citigroup to "liquidate" by the end of 2009 some 12 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it sold to other investors.
3748	4963	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"This settlement in principle is an outstanding example of federal and state regulatory cooperation for the benefit of investors and markets," Thomsen said at a news conference at SEC headquarters in Washington.
3749	4964	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The settlement was announced by federal and state regulators as a widespread credit crunch continues to weigh on major Wall Street banks.
3750	4965	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Officials said the buyback will benefit around 38,000 investors, small businesses and charities who had purchased the securities through Citigroup.
3751	4966	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Auction-rate securities, essentially debt instruments issued by financial firms, municipalities and student-loan companies, typically have a fairly lengthy maturity, but the interest rates on such securities can be volatile and change at weekly and monthly auctions overseen by banks.
3752	4967	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The SEC said Citigroup had marketed the securities as "liquid" investments, meaning they were almost as safe and accessible as cash, but the regulators said the securities were illiquid, making it hard for investors to reclaim their holdings.
3753	4968	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Such instruments formed a vital and lucrative business for many banks in recent years, but the market for auction-rate securities collapsed in February as the credit squeeze -- which began in the housing and mortgage markets -- worsened.

3762	4984	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad, who has long boasted of his ability to work hard, said he is often at his desk by 5:30 am and sometimes does not leave until after midnight.
3763	4985	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	"I used to visit my relatives more but now I do so less.

3765	4987	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	While sparking international controversy for comments predicting that Israel is doomed to disappear, Ahmadinejad has also sought to cultivate an image as a simple peace-loving man who offers friendship to everyone.

3773	5000	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	FINANCIAL CRISIS
3774	5001	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders issued a special statement on the financial crisis Saturday, vowing to take action "individually and collectively" to restore confidence in their economies and keep the region moving along the path of long-term growth.
3775	5002	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We have already taken urgent and extraordinary steps to stabilize our financial sectors and strengthen economic growth and promote investment and consumption," the statement said.
3776	5003	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to take such steps and work closely, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner, to implement future actions to address this crisis," it added.
3777	5004	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders specifically pledged support for efforts by export credit agencies, international financial institutions and private banks to ensure that adequate finance is available to businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and to keep trade and investment flowing in the region.
3778	5005	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	They also welcomed continued development and innovation in the financial sector, while calling for more effective regulatory and supervisory tools as financial systems become more complex.
3779	5006	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The APEC leaders also expressed support for the Washington Declaration adopted at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month and the common principles that will guide the Action Plan for financial markets reform.
3780	5007	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As one of the world's biggest regional blocs with a wide geographical span and huge diversity among its members, APEC has sent a strong signal that world economies are ready to do everything possible to stave off the crisis and restore market confidence, analysts say.
3781	5008	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	FREE TRADE
3782	5009	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	During the meeting, the leaders highlighted the urgency to curb any upturn of protectionism that could arise from the crisis and exacerbate the current economic situation.
3783	5010	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders reiterated their "firm belief that free market principles, and open trade and investment regimes will continue to drive global growth, employment and poverty reduction."
3784	5011	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, they promised not to raise new barriers to investment and trade in the next 12 months.
3785	5012	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We...will refrain within the next 12 months from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services, imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent measures in all areas, including those that stimulate exports," the statement said.
3786	5013	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On the Doha round of trade talks, APEC leaders expressed their hope for "an ambitious and balanced conclusion" to lay the foundation for the economic growth and prosperity in the region.
3787	5014	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We are committed to reach agreement on modalities next month on the basis of progress made to date," they added.
3788	5015	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The strong call by the leaders for free trade and rejection of protectionism indicates that world economies are determined to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s when "a wrong approach" was taken, as U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said.
3789	5016	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
3790	5017	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	One of the highlights of the APEC Leaders' Week from Nov. 16-23 was the leaders' efforts to explore the social dimension of APEC, especially corporate social responsibility, amid the crisis.
3791	5018	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"The crisis also highlights the need to develop more effective standards of corporate governance and risk management as well as the importance of social responsibility in the financial sector," the statement said.
3792	5019	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders urged companies to incorporate social responsibility into their business strategies to take account of social, labor and environmental concerns.
3793	5020	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	Such a move is likely to boost confidence among investors and consumers who have accused some companies of a reckless pursuit of profits, which triggered the financial meltdown, analysts say.
3794	5022	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	More stringent measures need to be taken to prevent a repeat of the economic turmoil, critics say.
3795	5023	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As APEC leaders largely refrained from digging into details of the pledged action before a new U.S. president takes office next January, world economies should remain strongly vigilant about the ongoing financial storm, which may get worse before it can get any better, analysts say.
3796	5024	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	U.N. chief says Bush asked for increased U.N. presence in Iraq but he cited security concerns
3797	5025	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS 2007-01-17 21:55:13 UTC
3798	5029	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	During the meetings, Ban said, he emphasized the importance of "a strong partnership" between the United States and the United Nations in addressing U.N. reform and global challenges.
3799	5030	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	He said he was "very much encouraged" that Bush pledged continued U.S. support and participation "in all areas of U.N. activities," and welcomed the "very strong support and warm reception by Congressional leaders."
3800	5031	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked to explain why he called Bush a "great leader" when talking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday.
3801	5032	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"I'm wondering why you are asking that question," he replied.
3802	5033	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"In diplomacy, it is appropriate to address any head of state or government with due respect and courtesy.
3803	5034	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	I hope you understand these diplomatic practices."
3804	5035	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his response.
3805	5040	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	U.N. international staffers started returning in August 2004 and U.N. experts played key roles in helping Iraqis draft a new constitution and prepare for elections, but the numbers on the ground are limited because of increasing insecurity, especially in Baghdad.
3806	5041	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"The United Nations has been and will continue wherever and whenever we can to increase our presence there, but that will be largely constrained by the security concerns," Ban told reporters Wednesday.
3807	5042	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	In Washington on Tuesday, Ban called the situation in the Middle East a "source of grave concern" and said "Iraq and elsewhere needs an urgent attention of the international community."
3808	5045	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Bush went ahead and led an invasion of Iraq without U.N. authorization in March 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein from power.
3809	5046	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	John Bolton, who could not win Senate confirmation as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and resigned last month as his temporary appointment was about to expire, was highly critical of the United Nations, especially its reform efforts, and was unhappy with Annan's performance on a number of issues.
3810	5047	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban refused to compare his relationship with the United States with Annan's.
3811	5048	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"What I stressed during my meetings with president Bush and all Congressional leaders is that while there was a time when the relationship between the United Nations and the United States was not easy, it is time now to look for better days between the United Nations and the United States," he said.
3812	5049	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"And I am quite confident that we will see better days and a mutually cooperative relationship."
3813	5050	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway gives 17 million euros to protect the Amazon
3814	5051	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway said Tuesday it would donate 130 million kroner (17 million euros, 24 million dollars) to help protect the Amazon rain forest, the deforestation of which is leading to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
3815	5053	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	"The felling and burning of tropical forests is a significant cause of greenhouse gases," Solheim said in a statement.
3816	5054	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	"The actions necessary to put an end to deforestation will be an important theme during the upcoming climate talks in Bali in December," he added.
3817	5055	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Deforestation currently accounts for 20 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
3818	5057	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway will contribute 60 million kroner to two projects run by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and an additional 70 million kroner to a special rain forest fund.
3819	5059	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Between August 2006 and July 2007, after the government adopted measures to protect the forest, the rate of deforestation slowed to 9,600 square kilometers.
3820	5060	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Movie review: Twisted revenge tale `Teeth ' will leave you laughing and squirming
3821	5062	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	The name "Teeth" may ring a bell with you.
3822	5063	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's a film that had audiences laughing and squirming simultaneously last year at Sundance, where it earned an acting prize for its fresh-faced, fearless star, Jess Weixler.
3823	5064	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth.
3824	5065	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Yes, she is a living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his feature debut.
3825	5066	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge tale.
3826	5067	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross- out factor he'd established early on.
3827	5068	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(You do see severed, um, parts.)
3828	5070	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	She's part of an organization known as The Promise, and gives out red plastic rings for kids to wear as a reminder of their chastity.
3829	5071	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Even kissing is a no-no.
3830	5072	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But Lichtenstein never makes fun of her, and Weixler, whose wholesome blond looks are reminiscent of a younger Heather Graham, treats the character with just as much respect.
3831	5073	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Dawn may be fiercely protective of her innocence in reaction to an event that took place when she was a very young girl, something she doesn't even remember but we see at the film's start.
3832	5074	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Her new stepbrother, Brad, tries to mess around with her while the two are in a kiddie wading pool and gets "bitten"
3833	5075	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	years later, grown-up Brad (John Hensley from "Nip/Tuck"), is tatted, pierced, perpetually stoned and hates women.
3834	5076	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But he still wants to do it with Dawn, and the fact that she's so fearful of her budding sexuality only makes her more desirable.
3835	5077	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Being a teenager, though, her curiosity eventually takes over and she allows herself to become interested in a boy in the abstinence group, the slightly goofy Tobey (Hale Appleman).
3836	5078	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But when he tries to go too far with her while swimming at the lake one afternoon, he learns too late that no really does mean no.
3837	5079	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	A visit to the gynecologist to find out what's wrong with her also has disastrous consequences.
3838	5080	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(It's the film's funniest scene, mainly because we all know what's coming and the arrogant doctor doesn't).
3839	5081	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Eventually, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew (sorry, couldn't resist) as Dawn feels increasingly comfortable in her own skin and begins seducing men who deserve their comeuppance.
3840	5082	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(Its climactic moment, if you will, is way too over the top.)
3841	5083	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	And a subplot involving her dying mother seems out of place in contrast with the comedy.
3842	5084	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But it's easy to imagine "Teeth" gaining a cult following through midnight showings
3843	5085	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	it's the kind of movie you want to watch with friends, to laugh and scream and not have to think too hard, and then who knows?
3844	5086	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Maybe go home and get lucky afterward.
3845	5087	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	"Teeth," a Roadside Attractions release, runs 87 minutes.
3846	5088	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Two and a half stars out of four.

3848	5091	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	They are two angry political warriors bearing grudges from the past, convinced the other is a liar and an incompetent destined to destroy the country.
3849	5093	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	It was then that Zapatero unexpectedly swept to victory, ousting Rajoy's Popular Party from power as enraged voters protested the government's mishandling of terrorist bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid three days before the election.
3850	5094	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The candidates have used this year's campaign not only to lay out starkly different visions for Spain but also to settle personal scores.
3851	5095	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Rajoy still contends that he was a victim of circumstances in 2004, robbed of victory after his party insisted that the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA was responsible for the attack, despite evidence that pointed to radical Islamists.
3852	5096	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, the election swept in a government that lacked legitimacy and since then has abused its mandate by shattering family values, weakening the economy, embracing unworthy immigrants and coddling terrorists.
3853	5098	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, Rajoy is a prisoner of the past who has sought revenge for his electoral loss in 2004 by using the conservative party he heads to try to undermine the government's ability to rule.
3854	5099	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Despite the mudslinging, political analysts and pollsters say neither candidate has managed to excite voters or lay out a coherent vision.
3855	5100	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	But in poll after poll for months, Zapatero has consistently stayed in the lead.
3856	5101	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The wild card in the election is potential fallout from the chilling gang-style killing of a former city councilman from the Socialist Party on Friday.
3857	5102	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Both the government and the opposition have blamed ETA for the killing.
3858	5103	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Throughout the campaign, Rajoy has attacked Zapatero for negotiating with ETA.
3859	5104	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Zapatero cut off the talks after ETA bombed Madrid's airport in December 2006, then admitted in January of this year that indirect contacts had continued.
3860	5105	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Since then, Rajoy has accused him of lying.
3861	5106	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	ETA, which has killed more than 800 people over four decades in a bid for an independent Basque homeland, is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union.

3864	5109	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for February delivery, eased 13 cents to 38.90 dollars a barrel after falling 99 cents to 39.03 dollars on Tuesday at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
3865	5110	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Brent North Sea crude for February delivery fell six cents to 40.09 dollars a barrel after shedding 40 cents to 40.15 on Tuesday in London.
3866	5111	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Prices soared in the first half of the year, reaching record highs above 147 dollars a barrel in July, before a sharp global economic downturn slashed world demand for energy and pulled prices sharply lower.
3867	5112	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	New York crude plunged earlier this month to below 33 dollars, its lowest point for almost five years.
3868	5115	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	"It is probably not productive to search too deeply for the rationale behind market movements at this time of year because they are generally more expressive of accounting necessities than market sentiment," he said.

3881	5132	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Inter coach Jose Mourinho rested striker Ibrahimovic in the first half but with Adriano, Amantino Mancini and Ricardo Quaremsa up front, his side seemed to have enough firepower to sink Bremen.
3882	5134	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Bremen, weekend by several injuries and the suspension of playmaker Diego, did not threaten much either, except for a header from close range from Pizarro that was palmed away by Cesar.
3883	5135	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Ibrahimovic came on for Adriano at the break, but Bremen had the first chance, with Pizarro sending a volley high over the net.

3887	5139	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	A bad clearance by Inter gave Mesit Oezil some space, Cesar parried his shot but could not hold onto the ball and Pizarro tapped in the rebound.
3888	5140	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Cesar was in trouble again after another shot by Oezil but this time the Inter defense cleared the ball.

3904	5165	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The lawyer had turned up at court on Friday morning to file the appeal papers when he was shown documents confirming the deportation order had been already carried out at the behest of acting attorney general Bharat Patel.
3905	5166	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Patel was also one of the judges at the high court ruling.

3911	5175	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The application has been dismissed because Simon Mann was deported before the appeal was noted at the supreme court," Julia Woods, another of the Briton's lawyers, told AFP after the hearing.

3951	5234	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed a man in northern Vietnam in the country's second death from the illness this year, and health officials warned Thursday that the virus could spread further.
3952	5236	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The man's test results came back positive Sunday for the dangerous H5N1 virus strain.

4004	5327	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The co-founder of Neteller, a company based in Britain that processed billions of dollars in Internet gambling transactions for Americans, has pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal conspiracy.
4005	5328	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Lawrence, whose company, Neteller PLC, was once one of the primary ways U.S. citizens placed bets with offshore bookies, acknowledged in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that the operation was illegal.
4006	5329	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"I came to understand that providing payment services to online gambling Web sites serving customers in the United States was wrong," he told the judge Friday.
4007	5330	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	His lawyers said he was cooperating with U.S. investigators and also had agreed to be at least partly responsible for the $100 million (euro74.05 million) the government is seeking in restitution.
4008	5331	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and another Neteller director, John David Lefebvre, were arrested in January as part of a U.S. crackdown on the online gambling industry.
4009	5333	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Their company was based in the Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
4010	5334	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Some experts initially believed that Neteller's offshore status put it beyond the reach of U.S. law.
4011	5335	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The company also was not directly involved in either placing or receiving bets.
4012	5336	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It essentially served as a financial middleman, through which bettors could send and receive cash from Web-based operations located in countries with few restrictions on gambling.
4013	5337	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors read U.S. law differently, and charged Lawrence with violating decades-old acts prohibiting the use of electronic wires to send or receive information that facilitates illegal gambling.
4014	5338	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, who remains free on $5 million (euro3.7 million) bail, declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
4015	5339	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"Mr. Lawrence is very glad to have this episode over and is looking forward to moving on to the next stage in his life," said his attorney, Peter Neiman.
4016	5340	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He said Lawrence intended to return to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been scheduled for October.
4017	5341	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear whether Lawrence will face prison time.
4018	5342	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the case.
4019	5343	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The case against Lefebvre, who pleaded not guilty, is pending.

4021	5346	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said Neteller processed $5.1 billion worth of transactions in the first half of 2006.
4022	5347	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Nearly all involved online gambling.
4023	5348	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	A majority of the company's revenue came from customers in the U.S., and the FBI began looking at its operations in June 2006.
4024	5349	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, at one point, was the company's largest shareholder.
4025	5350	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Both he and Lefebvre have since left the company's board of directors.
4026	5351	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and Lefebvre are among a group of businessmen linked to online gambling who have faced U.S. charges.

4034	5361	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
4035	5362	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, reeling under a negative TV ad campaign from rival Mitt Romney, said Monday he made a last-minute decision to pull an anti-Romney ad he had shipped to Iowa stations.
4036	5363	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
4037	5364	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge gamble on my part.
4038	5365	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
4039	5366	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll probably be the last guy to ever do this."
4040	5367	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said, appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads despite the fact that history indicates they work.
4041	5369	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
4042	5370	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.
4043	5371	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A McClatchy/MSNBC poll conducted Dec. 3-6 showed Huckabee in first place, 12 points ahead of runner-up Romney.
4044	5372	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	But last week, the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was second.
4045	5373	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
4046	5374	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign
4047	5375	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	and on the other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
4048	5376	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	And I think that's a very confusing and puzzling message," he said, referring to the news coverage that is sure to spread the Huckabee ad's message.
4049	5377	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Madden branded Huckabee's decision to pull the ad but show it at a news conference as "a bizarre display of hypocrisy."
4050	5378	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee told reporters he showed them the ad because if he didn't, "you'd say, 'Where's the ad?"
4051	5379	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The ad was produced Sunday and shipped to Iowa stations to begin airing Monday.
4052	5380	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.
4053	5382	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"If a man's dishonest to obtain a job, he'll be dishonest on the job."
4054	5383	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	University of Iowa political scientist Peverill Squire said Huckabee's move "suggests the campaign is a bit more amateur than its competition."
4055	5384	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
4056	5385	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	On the Democratic side, a Reuters-C-SPAN-Zogby poll released Monday and conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Clinton at 30 percent among likely caucus-goers
4057	5386	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama and Edwards each were at 26 percent.
4058	5387	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, making it a statistical three-way tie.
4059	5388	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A previous poll last week had Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
4060	5389	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Edwards is pushing a populist message that is finding a receptive audience in Iowa.
4061	5390	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti- Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
4062	5391	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton targeted Edwards during a stop in Keokuk, apparently mocking his animated attacks on special interests.
4063	5392	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's not something you have to do by yelling and screaming.
4064	5393	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Save your energy.
4065	5394	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Get the job done," she said about battles in Washington.
4066	5395	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"Instead of generating a lot of heat, rolling your hands and jumping up and down, sit down and figure out how we're going to beat them."
4067	5396	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as first lady amounted to chatting over tea.
4068	5397	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, she responded sharply to these jabs, noting that she was the first high-level American to go to Bosnia after the Dayton peace accords.
4069	5398	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"We landed in one of those cork screw landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire - I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac," she said.
4070	5399	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Last Friday, Obama suggested his global experience eclipses the eight years Clinton spent as first lady.
4071	5400	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's that experience, that understanding, not just of what world leaders I went and talked to in the ambassador's house I had tea with, but understanding the lives of the people like my grandmother who lives in a tiny hut in Africa," he said.
4072	5401	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout.
4073	5402	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Marion County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus.
4074	5403	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	My job is to be so persuasive that you conclude 'I've got to go for Obama.

4076	5405	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	All three Democrats found themselves negatively depicted in a last-minute round of phone calls to likely caucus-goers in Iowa.
4077	5406	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In each case, recipients told the Associated Press that a caller pretending to conduct a poll of candidate preferences began by asking who the caucus-goer intends to support.

4081	5410	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Timothy Bradley has set his sights on becoming the king of the world's light- welterweights after capturing the WBC belt in shock split point decision win over Junior Witter.
4082	5411	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	In his first professional fight outside of his native California, Bradley knocked Witter over in the sixth round and did enough to claim the World Boxing Council title by judges' decisions of 115-113 and 114-113 for, and 115-112 against.
4083	5412	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It was a controlled, clever and calculated display from Bradley, who not only conceded home advantage but ten years to the more experienced Witter.
4084	5413	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Englishman Witter looked on the verge of suffering his first stoppage defeat when Bradley caught him with a looping right.
4085	5414	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I always knew I would get to Junior in the second half of the fight," Bradley told AFP.
4086	5415	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"He pulls back his chin in the air so I felt I could throw a counter right and it worked in the sixth.
4087	5416	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"It’s a punch that I have worked on.
4088	5417	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew the first four rounds would be hard but through the sixth and seventh rounds I came on.
4089	5418	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew I had to win it in the second half of the fight."
4090	5419	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter, 34, sank to the canvas in his own corner to take a mandatory eight count and sensibly avoided any danger by back- pedalling for the rest of the sixth round.
4091	5421	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	At the end of the fight, Witter looked concerned as to the outcome and Bradley is now left in line for bigger pay days against the other world champions in the division -- Andreas Kotelnik (WBA), Paulie Malignaggi (IBF) and Ricardo Torres (WBO).
4092	5423	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I love Ricky Hatton and I would love to fight him.
4093	5424	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	If the fight took place in the USA and the money was right, I would fight Junior again too," he said.
4094	5425	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter admitted he was not in the sort of form that had seen him knock out former WBA champion Vivian Harris in September, and blamed over-training for his poor performance.
4095	5426	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"My timing and speed just wasn't there.
4096	5427	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I always thought if I just turned up I would win, but I didn't turn up.
4097	5428	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"Getting put down in the sixth cost me the fight, but I still thought I did enough to win the fight.

4100	5431	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It had nothing to do with making the weight, but I never felt great in the fight and it could be that I overtrained which was why I wasn't myself.

4117	5463	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)
4118	5464	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday issued a notice to call for intensified prevention and control of blue-ear pig disease as the country is entering the peak season for the disease.
4119	5465	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The highly pathogenic blue-ear disease, also known as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), has already killed 18,000 pigs this year.
4120	5466	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice said local governments should improve the emergency plans for the disease outbreak and section off and cease pork trading in affected areas at the time of an outbreak.
4121	5467	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	New vaccines for the disease, produced under the supervision of China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory Institution, have been put into use, said the notice.
4122	5468	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Local governments should establish immunity records for pigs, it said.
4123	5469	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said local authorities should increase studies on the cause of the disease and strengthen inspections and quarantine of pig delivery.
4124	5470	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Pig breeders have been ordered not to kill, eat, sale and deliver pigs that have died from the disease and treat the dead animals and their excrement properly, according to the notice.
4125	5471	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said stricter disinfection measures should be taken in small pig farms.
4126	5472	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Between January and May, 45,000 pigs contracted the disease, but a ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions had reported outbreaks.
4127	5474	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The ministry has dispatched inspection teams to supervise disease control and prevention work.
4128	5475	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some areas.
4129	5476	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	It is believed the price hikes will help raise the country's consumer price index, or CPI, to a new high for May.

4133	5482	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola took the helm on Wednesday of the oil cartel OPEC at a time when plunging crude prices are casting a shadow over the previously glowing prospects of Africa's fastest growing economy.
4134	5483	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	The resurgence of the southern African nation, which was devastated by a 27-year civil war, has been almost entirely dependent on its oil output which accounts for a staggering 90 percent of revenue.
4135	5484	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola is OPEC's newest member, only joining in 2007, and sees its year-long presidency as a chance to forge a new image for a country more usually associated with conflict.
4136	5486	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola has overtaken Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, pumping around two million barrels per day, and is now the biggest supplier to China.
4137	5487	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Months of high oil prices, which hit a peak of 147 dollars a barrel in July, led the ruling party to announce ambitious spending plans ahead of parliamentary elections in September such as building one million new homes.
4138	5488	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	But with price having now slumped to around 45 dollars a barrel, the government has had to revise its 2008 growth forecast from 20 percent to 16 percent and begin to eat into its reserves.
4139	5490	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Should there be the need for a revision of the state budget due to the drop of the oil price in the world market that will be done next year," Junior said in parliament.
4140	5491	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	This spending plan is essential for the reconstruction of a nation decimated by the civil war which ended in 2002, with 70 percent of the population still living on less than two dollars a day, according to the World Bank.
4141	5494	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Many members of OPEC need oil to go up because they have calculated their budgets based on high oil prices," he told AFP.
4142	5495	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"For instance Angola has promised to build one million houses and they have to find the revenues from somewhere to do that.
4143	5496	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	And you see the same things happening in Nigeria and Venezuela for example."
4144	5500	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Angola is a player -- and it's a player because of oil.
4145	5501	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Today if you talk about Angola, you talk about oil," he said.
4146	5502	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Now with the presidency of OPEC, they are going to have more visibility and I hope that this mandate goes well to guarantee a positive image for the governance of Angola."

4149	5506	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	Nataline Sarkisyan, the 17-year-old Northridge girl whose death last week sparked a renewed call for health-care reform after she was twice denied a prescribed liver transplant, was buried Friday after a tear-streaked funeral.

4160	5522	NYT_ENG_20071228.0212.LDC2009T13	On Dec. 11, Cigna denied a liver transplant for the girl, despite the pleadings of physicians at UCLA Medical Center where she was treated.

4184	5549	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
4185	5550	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
4186	5551	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
4187	5552	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
4188	5553	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	But this short-term fix is not enough.
4189	5554	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Upgrading the air traffic control system is the real solution to America's air-travel woes.
4190	5555	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
4191	5556	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In announcing the policy, the Transportation Department noted that the number of arrival delays exceeding one hour there increased by 114 percent in the first 10 months of fiscal 2007.
4192	5557	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
4193	5558	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
4194	5559	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
4195	5560	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
4196	5561	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
4197	5562	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The incentive for airport operators is that they can factor into their fees the reasonable costs associated with runway and other facility improvements that would ultimately aid in reducing delays.
4198	5563	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.
4199	5565	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Federal Aviation Administration has been waiting for nearly a year for Congress to fund a state-of-the-art satellite navigation system that would allow pilots and controllers to use air space more efficiently.
4200	5566	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	A dogfight among the various interests over how to pay for it is bogging things down.
4201	5567	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It's time Congress resolved it.

4239	5628	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Stevens did not immediately concede the race.
4240	5629	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	He could request a recount, but he would have to pay for it if the current vote margins hold.
4241	5630	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Begich's victory will end the career of the longest-serving Republican senator ever and a pivotal figure in the history of his state after it initially appeared he would triumph despite his criminal conviction just days before the election.
4242	5631	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The defeat came on Stevens' 85th birthday at the end of a day that saw him avoid expulsion from the Senate Republican Caucus as his colleagues said they would await the final results.
4243	5632	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't wish what I going through on anyone, my worst enemy," Stevens said Tuesday morning in the Capitol.
4244	5635	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision was part of the post-election congressional tableaux as Senate Democrats and Republicans re-elected their current leadership teams for the first two years of the Obama administration.
4245	5636	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	House Democrats met to make Rep. Nancy Pelsoi of California their candidate for speaker and essentially kept their leadership intact as well, with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland remaining majority leader.
4246	5638	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But a pragmatic dynamic was at work as well.
4247	5639	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Having added seven new senators to their side, Democrats want to avoid driving Lieberman to the Republican fold.
4248	5640	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Even though they fell short of the 60 needed to cut off filibusters, the Democrats are aiming to keep their majority as large as possible next year when, for the first time since 1994, they have control of Congress and the White House.
4249	5641	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Two other Senate seats, in Minnesota and Georgia, have yet to be decided as well.
4250	5643	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Democrats voted 42-13 to let Lieberman stay at the helm of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs while removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he led a subcommittee.
4251	5645	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers who attended the session said that Lieberman openly discussed the political and personal hurt he experienced when many of his colleagues campaigned against him after he lost a Democratic Senate primary in 2006 before winning re-election as an independent.
4252	5646	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After the vote, he expressed some remorse for his campaign comments but noted the resolution did not chastise him directly for backing McCain, who returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to resume life as a senator.
4253	5647	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lieberman, who only eight years ago was the party's nominee for vice president, said there were statements he could have made "more clearly.
4254	5648	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And there are some that I made that I wish I had not made at all.
4255	5649	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And obviously in the heat of campaigns, that happens to all of us.
4256	5650	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But I regret that.
4257	5651	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	And now it's time to move on."
4258	5653	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	They said that stripping the chairmanship was only fitting.
4259	5655	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"Having said that, there is an enormous amount of work that is facing the Senate, and we all have to move on and work together to address these issues," Sanders said.
4260	5656	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The reluctance of the senators to move forcefully against their colleagues illustrates again how cautious senators are when it comes to punishing their own.
4261	5657	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After being thwarted repeatedly by Republican resistance in the past two years, Senate Democrats were unwilling to lose the support of Lieberman on most domestic policy issues, particularly after Obama had urged that Lieberman be allowed to remain in the Democratic fold.
4262	5658	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The resolution noted that Lieberman's vote gave Democrats the majority in 2007 and that he voted almost 100 percent of the time with the party on key procedural issues.
4263	5660	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"But I also believe that if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk about of here saying, 'Boy, did we get even'?
4264	5661	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	I am very satisfied with what we did today."
4265	5662	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision touched off attacks on the Democrats by liberal and progressive groups and on the Internet, where critics accused Democrats of weakness in their posture against Lieberman, who they have branded a traitor to Democrats.
4266	5663	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But senators pointed to statements by the Obama campaign in support of Lieberman as justification for their decision.
4267	5667	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	In the House, Democrats gathered for the leadership elections and bid farewell to Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., who is relinquishing his No. 4 post in the party hierarchy to become chief of staff to Obama.
4268	5668	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Those in the closed meeting said Emanuel became emotional and told his colleagues it was "not an easy decision for me" to give up his House seat.
4269	5669	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know, I've got your back," Emanuel said, according to one account.
4270	5670	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I'll feel better knowing that you've got my back."
4271	5672	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The Vatican's ambassador in Spain accused the country's media of "discrimination" on Wednesday for giving what he said was too much attention to a sexual abuse scandal involving priests in the United States.
4272	5673	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	"If you read the newspapers you will find the same cases every day, sometimes filling an entire page.
4273	5675	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	"This is called discrimination, no matter how good one wants to be," he added.
4274	5677	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The case has dominated headlines in Spain this week.
4275	5679	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	Spain has passed from being a bastion of Roman Catholicism to a predominantly secular society in less than a generation.

4403	5874	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Anna Nicole Smith's daughter will inherit the former Playboy model's estate, a judge ruled Tuesday.
4404	5875	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Eighteen-month-old Dannielynn Hope was named sole heir by Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff, who also set up a trust in the girl's name.
4405	5876	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Her father, Larry Birkhead, and Smith's executor, Harry K. Stern, will be co-trustees.
4406	5877	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Beckloff granted a petition filed by Stern, who wanted to clarify Smith's intentions toward her daughter.
4407	5878	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Smith drafted a will in 2001 -- five years before the child was born -- that left her estate to her then-only son, Daniel.
4408	5879	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	However, it said the assets in Daniel's trust should be shared equally if she had future children.
4409	5880	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Daniel was 20 when he died in 2006, three days after Dannielynn was born.

4412	5884	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	His relatives have been fighting the will for years.

4432	5925	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Gillian Gibbons, in a dark jacket and blue skirt, was not handcuffed but looked tired as she walked into the courtroom in Khartoum, according to reporters inside, before media were ordered out of the chamber.
4433	5930	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"There is an innocent misunderstanding at the heart of this, not a criminal offense," Miliband told reporters.
4434	5932	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Officials at the Unity High School, a private school where Gibbons teaches, say the teddy bear was part of a class project to teach her 7-year-old pupils about animals.
4435	5933	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	She asked the students to name the bear and they chose the name Muhammad, a common name among Muslim men.
4436	5934	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Each child was allowed to take the bear home on weekends and write a diary about what they did with it.
4437	5935	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The diary entries were collected in a book with the bear's picture on the cover, labeled, "My Name is Muhammad," according to the school director, Robert Boulos.
4438	5937	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	It was unclear who made the complaint.
4439	5938	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Boulos told media earlier in the week it came from several parents, but on Thursday he told The Associated Press that police informed him it came from a staffer at the school.
4440	5939	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"We hope the case will be dismissed," he said, adding the school could hire private guards to protect Gibbons' when she returned.

4442	5945	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He briefly came out to say the proceedings were postponed as the plaintiff had not yet shown up.
4443	5949	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"When somebody is named Muhammad by his parents and then turns out to be a thief, is it an insult to religion to say, 'That Muhammad is a thief'?

4445	5951	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped the trial would be finished Thursday.
4446	5955	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He denied reports that the school had fired Gibbons.
4447	5958	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	But there were signs the case could become a rallying case for Islamic hard-liners.

4495	6035	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In Dickens World, rat-catchers hunt vermin on London's cobbled streets, pickpockets roam the alleys -- and visitors line up for a fun-tastic water ride.
4496	6037	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Literary purists may balk, but the attraction's backers are confident.
4497	6038	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"Would Dickens approve?
4498	6039	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Yes," said Thelma Grove of the Dickens Fellowship, a global association of the writer's fans.
4499	6040	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"He loved to see people enjoy themselves, and he had a very sharp eye for the latest fad."
4500	6041	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In more than a dozen sprawling novels, from "The Pickwick Papers" to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," Dickens created a rich tapestry of 19th-century England, peopled by struggling workers, aspiring clerks, jaded lawyers, ambitious orphans, rogues, runaways and thieves.
4501	6042	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Still in print after more than a century, the books have inspired numerous film and television adaptations and a popular musical, "Oliver!"
4502	6043	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Dickens World's backers say they are trying to capture that vibrant landscape in their 62 million pound (US$125 million
4503	6044	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro92 million) theme park.
4504	6045	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They insist it is "based on a credible and factual account of Charles Dickens' works and the world in which he lived."
4505	6047	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The indoor attraction includes a central square of cobbled streets and crooked buildings, where staff dressed as pickpockets and serving wenches will mingle with the crowds.
4506	6048	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Visitors who pay the 12.50 pounds (US$25
4507	6049	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro18) admission charge -- 7.50 pounds (US$15

4509	6051	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Tourists can also have a meal in the cafeteria, which has resisted the temptation to offer "Please, sir can I have some more?"

4512	6054	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	There may be a whiff of kitsch in the air at Dickens World, but its supporters include some serious Dickens buffs.
4513	6055	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's like a dream come true," said Grove, who acted as an adviser on the project.
4514	6056	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	She helped ensure that everything from the names on the faux shopfronts to the pharmacy offering "syrup of squirrels" was true to the Victorian period.
4515	6057	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"People who don't know their Dickens won't know whether they are authentic or not," she said.
4516	6058	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"But I want to be above criticism."
4517	6059	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	At the moment, Dickens World is a work in progress.
4518	6060	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A planned opening this week was postponed at the last minute until May 25 due to a glitch with the "4D animatronic theater show" about Dickens' life and work.
4519	6061	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	As journalists toured the site Wednesday, hard-hatted construction workers unfurled a banner featuring a Victorian skyline across the front of the hangar-like building in Chatham, 35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of London.
4520	6062	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Promotional literature for Dickens World promises the "sounds and smells" of the 19th century.
4521	6063	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	For now it sounds like a construction site and smells of sawdust and fresh paint.
4522	6064	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be a few weeks, but you can see we're getting there," Christie said.
4523	6065	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	One aspect of the attraction is inarguably authentic -- Dickens' links with this corner of southeast England run deep.
4524	6066	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The writer spent several years of his childhood in Chatham, where his father worked as a clerk at the Royal Navy dockyards, and he returned to the region late in life.
4525	6067	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The nearby marshland was memorably evoked in "Great Expectations."
4526	6068	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Chatham's docks are long closed, and Dickens World -- sandwiched between an outlet mall and a multiplex cinema -- is part of the region's attempt at redevelopment.
4527	6069	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Management and staff alike are embracing the project with enthusiasm.
4528	6070	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's a living experience where you can go back in time," said Eddie Sampson, who plays rat-catcher and "gentle rogue" Ned Fiendish, one of several characters who wander the streets of Dickens World adding Victorian color and dispensing directions to visitors.
4529	6071	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Sampson has taken to his work with gusto, creating an elaborate biography for his character.
4530	6072	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	He says Ned never knew his father, fought at the battle of Waterloo, supplements rat-catching with a bit of housebreaking but has a good heart.
4531	6073	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"I invented the entire story," Sampson said with pride.
4532	6074	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Managers hope the staff's enthusiasm will rub off on visitors.They want Dickens to be thought of as fun.
4533	6075	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Asked for the park's mission statement, Grove quotes the admirable Mr. Sleary from Dickens' "Hard Times": "People must be amused, squire, somehow.
4534	6076	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They can't be always a-working, nor yet they can't be always a-learning."

4559	6106	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The data spooked some pundits and Wall Street investors who had hoped that receding inflation could set the stage for a Fed rate cut sometime this year.
4560	6108	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
4561	6109	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
4562	6110	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	On a year-on-year basis, the headline consumer price index was up 2.1 percent and the core CPI rose 2.7 percent.
4563	6111	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Fed's official forecast calls for core inflation to be in a range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent for 2007.
4564	6112	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	That is slightly above what economists see as the central bank's "comfort zone" of under 2.0 percent.
4565	6114	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
4566	6115	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be well controlled," he said.
4567	6116	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates."
4568	6117	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	And minutes from the January 31 meeting of the Fed's policy committee, released Wednesday, showed that Bernanke and his colleagues "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."
4569	6118	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
4570	6120	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large 0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest such reading since August 1991," he said.
4571	6121	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the second half of the year."
4572	6122	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April 2005.
4573	6123	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
4574	6124	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"Yes, there are some strange elements in it but you cannot simply exclude the ones you don't like in the months that don't come out the way you like it."
4575	6126	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"And investors should start asking what they should expect for long-term inflation.
4576	6127	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."
4577	6128	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	In other news Wednesday, the private-sector Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of activity in the coming six to nine months, rose just 0.1 percent last month.
4578	6129	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But the December reading was revised up to 0.6 percent.

4580	6133	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	One of Amsterdam's best-known sex clubs has become the latest victim of the city's crackdown on organized crime infiltration of the city's world famous sex industry.
4581	6135	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Amsterdam has been conducting a crackdown on criminality in the city center for nearly five years, using a 2002 law that forces business operators to disclose detailed accounting in order to have their licenses renewed.
4582	6136	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal activities.

4584	6138	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Wooldrik would not elaborate on what kind of criminal activities were suspected, but so-called private clubs and brothels have in the past been accused of laundering money for crime gangs involved in everything from drug dealing to extortion rackets.
4585	6139	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The club's owners have been ordered to close it down within weeks, but can appeal the decision to pull its license, Wooldrik said.

4660	6249	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.
4661	6250	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She has never seen a bill.
4662	6251	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
4663	6252	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs.
4664	6253	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
4665	6254	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
4666	6255	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
4667	6256	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
4668	6258	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
4669	6259	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	With limited federal guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions, frequently shaped by political winds.
4670	6260	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
4671	6261	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The number of patients is not large.
4672	6262	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In California, illegal immigrants account for about 1,350 of the 61,000 people on dialysis.
4673	6263	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
4674	6264	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
4675	6265	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The investment in a single patient can easily top $1 million over time.
4676	6266	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states draw the line at illegal immigrants.
4677	6267	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
4678	6268	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	That is because patients without regular dialysis frequently end up in emergency rooms.
4679	6269	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
4680	6271	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health, it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue.
4681	6273	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Such patients are at increased risk of heart attacks and infections.

4684	6277	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In grappling with what services to provide for illegal immigrants, some states tip toward the need to care for the sick.
4685	6278	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their presence.
4686	6279	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Congress tried to establish a balance.
4687	6280	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In 1986, it barred illegal immigrants from the federal health benefits generally available to the poor, with one notable exception: emergencies.
4688	6281	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The federal government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.
4689	6282	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

4691	6284	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Debates have flared over chemotherapy, life-support and dialysis.
4692	6286	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It failed.
4693	6287	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	What's left is an ambiguous policy that the federal government itself has struggled to clarify.
4694	6288	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.
4695	6289	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	If California and other states were using federal funds to help provide routine dialysis, she said, they were mischaracterizing it as an emergency treatment.
4696	6290	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	More recently, she acknowledged that the federal government has been sharing the cost in California for years.
4697	6291	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It has long been left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis, she said.
4698	6293	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Other states have wavered.
4699	6294	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	North Carolina, for example, now provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants.
4700	6297	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
4701	6298	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
4702	6299	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
4703	6300	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In a settlement last year, the state agreed to restore its policy of providing routine dialysis, but the settlement applies only to Arizona.
4704	6302	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of one routine treatment is about $250.
4705	6303	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
4706	6304	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	To advocates of stricter immigration controls, such comparisons miss the point.
4707	6306	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will lure more sick people from other countries.
4708	6308	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
4709	6309	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Now, a free transportation service picks her up three days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
4710	6310	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"If I go home, I won't be able to afford this," said Aquino, 56.
4711	6311	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"No way am I going home."
4712	6312	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California, but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand the gravity of their plight.

4714	6314	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid program does not.
4715	6316	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals pay for plane tickets back.
4716	6317	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Mexico offers dialysis to those who can afford it, but access is far more limited for the poor.

4718	6319	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
4719	6320	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
4720	6321	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"I have friends who have died because of lack of dialysis," said Lopez, a longtime diabetic who arrived in the U.S. four years ago while her kidneys were still functioning.
4721	6322	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal immigrants.
4722	6323	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
4723	6324	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three dialysis-free years.
4724	6325	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Critics, however, say that dipping into the organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are waiting.
4725	6326	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"It's not like you go to Costco and pick up a kidney," Krikorian said.
4726	6327	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
4727	6328	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She said she is grateful for the care she has received in California.
4728	6329	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.
4729	6330	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents in Mexico, she has never returned.
4730	6331	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be able to get back.

4732	6334	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The United States should face commercial sanctions worth more than US$3.4 billion (euro2.5 billion) each year for its failure to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that its Internet gambling restrictions are illegal, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda said Wednesday.
4733	6336	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	It said the sanctions would come into effect "shortly," unless the United States requests a WTO arbitration panel on the level and scope of the sanctions.

4735	6339	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The move by Antigua comes a day after the European Union told the United States it too wanted compensation for the U.S. ban on foreign online gambling sites.

4737	6341	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Antigua argues that before the ban was introduced, online gambling provided income for hundreds of its citizens and helped end its reliance on tourism, which was hurt by a series of hurricanes in the late 1990s.

4744	6356	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	Maliki has steadfastly refused to offer any timetable for withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq, saying any decision on the departure of US-led forces will be guided by the security situation on the ground.
4745	6357	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NOT THE SEASON YANKEES MANAGER JOE GIRARDI EXPECTED
4746	6358	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
4747	6360	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Girardi did not believe it would be the final time he would manage in the ballpark.
4748	6361	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He expected the Yankees to make the playoffs in his first season, expected the Stadium to live into October in its last season.
4749	6362	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But sometime soon, the Yankees will learn that they have been mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.
4750	6363	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
4751	6364	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
4752	6365	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a miracle.
4753	6366	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
4754	6367	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
4755	6368	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We expected more.
4756	6369	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	For whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to where we thought we were going to get."
4757	6371	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
4758	6372	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.
4759	6373	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said.
4760	6374	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I feel that I should have been able to make us better.
4761	6375	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't know how you can think any differently."
4762	6377	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
4763	6378	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
4764	6379	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
4765	6380	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from finishing in fourth place.
4766	6382	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage?
4767	6383	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
4768	6384	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?
4769	6385	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	How does his intense approach influence his players?
4770	6386	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
4771	6387	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
4772	6388	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You don't really know what it's like to be the manager of the New York Yankees until you go through it," he said.
4773	6389	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'
4774	6390	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
4775	6391	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
4776	6392	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
4777	6393	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
4778	6394	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest morsel of data.
4779	6395	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
4780	6396	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
4781	6397	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.
4782	6398	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I worry about the people who know me understanding why I did something."
4783	6399	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for the YES Network.
4784	6400	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism.
4785	6401	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Torre overused some pitchers and did not trust others.
4786	6402	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
4787	6403	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins in 2006, needed to improve in other areas.
4788	6404	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
4789	6405	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
4790	6406	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing to be positive, which obviously is what he's trying to do.
4791	6407	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	It's another thing to also be honest about how you really feel and what's going on.
4792	6408	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
4793	6409	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
4794	6410	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
4795	6412	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Tony Pena, the first-base coach, said Girardi would meet with the coaches after games to try to solve problems.
4796	6413	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We suffer," Pena said.
4797	6414	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Everybody suffers.
4798	6415	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We don't want to lose.
4799	6416	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't think our players want to lose, either.
4800	6417	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough road.
4801	6418	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough year."
4802	6419	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Few have had as tough a year as Cano, whose average has plummeted to .260 this season from .306 last year.
4803	6420	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	His on-base percentage is a sickly .294.
4804	6421	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Larry Bowa, a former third-base coach for the Yankees, said he motivated Cano by getting "in his face."
4805	6422	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
4806	6423	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	In a move that is more about next season than this season, Girardi removed Cano from Sunday's game for not hustling on a fielding play.
4807	6424	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Andy Pettitte said Girardi held several team meetings in which he showed a fiery side, estimating that Girardi had challenged the Yankees as much as Torre ever did.
4808	6425	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
4809	6426	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
4810	6427	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like beating a dead horse."
4811	6428	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not specific.
4812	6429	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
4813	6430	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He added that this season's experiences could cause him to change, too.
4814	6431	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi, like the Steinbrenners, said he did not consider a season triumphant unless it ended with a championship.
4815	6432	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There are always "successful things" that happen across 162 games, he said, but how a team finishes is all that is relevant.
4816	6433	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Did you get to where you thought that you should get?"
4817	6434	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said.
4818	6435	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"With this team, right now, the answer is no."
4819	6436	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The final answer will undoubtedly be no.
4820	6437	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The season will end in disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something Girardi had not envisioned.
4821	6438	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Stadium will close earlier than Girardi expected.

4832	6454	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	And everyone was smiling.
4833	6455	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"You've either got to take it or I'm going to break it," Bean told the boy.
4834	6456	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"He was happy, and I was happy to get rid of it."
4835	6457	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean was happy with the results of the driver he used Saturday.
4836	6458	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He used a driver he'd tried earlier in the year on the Florida swing.
4837	6459	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	It was one of 40-some drivers he's tested this season.
4838	6461	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Hale Irwin, who had a two-shot lead after Friday's first round, struggled to a 1-under 71 but leads by one shot.
4839	6462	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, who has won 45 tournaments on the Champions Tour, has won 33 of 47 tournaments in which he was leading or sharing the lead heading into the final round.
4840	6463	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	When asked about his success while playing with the lead, Irwin stuck his fingers in his ears and said, "La, la, la, la, la, la!"
4841	6464	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, Bean and Bobby Wadkins will play in today's final round pairings.
4842	6465	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean and Wadkins, who shot a 67, are tied for second.
4843	6466	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Five others -- including Loren Roberts, Jim Thorpe and Gil Morgan -- are tied for fourth two shots back and 14players are within three shots of the lead.
4844	6467	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But seeing Irwin's name at the top of the leaderboard can't be too comforting for the rest of the field.
4845	6468	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"Trying to make up shots on Hale isn't the easiest thing in the world," Bean said.
4846	6469	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"I know I have to shoot at least this well (66) to have a chance."
4847	6470	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin had a three-shot lead after three holes when he made a 12-foot putt on the par-3 third hole.
4848	6471	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He was his typically consistent self -- hitting fairways and greens -- on the front nine.
4849	6472	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But Irwin struggled on the back nine.
4850	6473	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He started with an errant drive to the left on No. 17 and had to scramble, eventually sinking a 5-foot putt for bogey .
4851	6474	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Yet for all of Irwin's troubles -- he was going to go over them in his hotel, not at the range -- he still leads the tournament.
4852	6475	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that it's over, and I'm in the lead," Irwin said.
4853	6476	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that I went from a two-shot lead to a one- shot lead."
4854	6477	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hopes they can both put their best golf on display.
4855	6478	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"When you beat him, you usually beat a guy that doesn't make mistakes," Bean said.
4856	6479	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"To me, that's fun.
4857	6480	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Your games are both there.
4858	6481	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	You'd much rather win and make birdie than for someone else to make bogey."

4965	6657	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The police raids came a day after official results showed Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower house.

4971	6663	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The letter promises generous retirement packages for those unwilling to serve an MDC government.
4972	6664	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It also promises not to take back farms given to officers under Mugabe's land reform program, except in cases in which an officer got several farms or if land was being neglected.
4973	6666	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to give security forces time to clamp down.
4974	6667	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The law requires a run- off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in Harare said.

4978	6672	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people ... including myself."
4979	6673	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had canceled plans for a news conference.

4985	6681	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has ruled since his guerrilla army helped force an end to white minority rule and bring about an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, but his popularity has been battered by an economic freefall that followed the often-violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms in 2000.
4986	6682	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign, the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
4987	6683	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back to whites.
4988	6684	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
4989	6685	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and agricultural production has plunged.
4990	6686	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain and other Western nations.
4991	6687	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But Western sanctions involve only visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of his allies.

4993	6689	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old president.
4994	6690	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and suppressing the opposition.

4996	6695	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Reports said leaders of the ruling party scheduled a meeting Friday to discuss the run-off.
4997	6696	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many meetings tomorrow," but declined details.
4998	6697	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	International concern mounted about the continuing delays in releasing official election results.
4999	6700	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president," Annan said.
5000	6701	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"I urge them to do the right thing ... The election results should be released now."
5001	6702	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission said it was still receiving ballot boxes from the provinces, raising questions about where the votes had been.
5002	6703	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition has charged Mugabe planned to rig the results, and Western election observers have accused him of stealing previous elections.
5003	6704	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	According to official results, a total of 2,405,147 valid votes were cast in Saturday's parliamentary contests, supporting opposition charges that the voter roll of 5.9 million names had been hugely inflated with dead and fictitious people.

5007	6709	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 59.10 points (0.44 percent) to 13,486.74 and the Nasdaq shed 10.06 points (0.38 percent) to 2,606.90 at 1420 GMT.

5010	6712	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Mark Fightmaster at Schaeffer's Investors Service said the market was under pressure as "the impact of subprime mortgages has crept back into the picture."
5011	6713	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	He said this was highlighted by reports that Wall Street investment firm Bear Stearns was taking out 3.2 billion dollars in loans to keep creditors from seizing assets of its money- losing hedge funds hit by mortgage sector losses.
5012	6714	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"In addition, some believe that the initial public offering (IPO) of private behemoth Blackstone Group could signal a market top," Fightmaster said.
5013	6715	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	The private equity firm's share traded under the BX symbol shot higher to 45 dollars in electronic trades from 31 dollars after the biggest IPO so far this year, raising 4.1 billion dollars for the equity firm making its debut in the regulated stock market.
5014	6716	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	In floor trading, Blackstone shares were up 18 percent from the offering price at 36.45 dollars.
5015	6718	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"We believe the subprime problems have been widely publicized and thus pretty well discounted," he said.
5016	6719	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"The brake being applied on our bull (market) is simply its own internal dynamics and the internals are just a bit tired ... we look for more correction over the short term."

5018	6722	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
5019	6723	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Among stocks in focus, Bear Stearns fell 97 cents to 144.84 dollars with investors watching how it will cope with the losses at its hedge funds from mortgage securities holding "subprime" loans.
5020	6724	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the Wall Street bank appeared to be moving to avoid a "fire sale" of those assets.
5021	6725	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"The mere mention of the term 'fire sale' puts the capital markets on edge, but the notion that a loan agreement of some sort is being worked out to prevent that is helping to calm some of the nervousness," he said.
5022	6726	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"Nonetheless, the Bear Stearns hedge fund situation is providing a reality check for many investors that it is prudent to be more risk averse than they have been recently in their search for high yields."

5049	6769	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	As the fighting intensified in recent months, the rebels have been blamed for a series of deadly attacks on buses, trains and other targets in the capital of Colombo and other towns that have killed scores of civilians far from the war zone.
5050	6770	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities established a maze of roadblocks and checkpoints and continuously changed traffic patterns in Colombo in an effort to prevent new attacks.
5051	6771	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	They have also required all residents of the north to register with the police upon their arrival in the city.

5056	6777	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Ethnic Tamils living in the capital have complained of frequent police raids, harassment and arbitrary detentions as the fighting between government forces, dominated by the Sinhalese majority, and the Tamil Tigers escalated in recent years.
5057	6778	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities, who hold wide-ranging security powers under emergency regulations renewed by Parliament each month, have long accused rebel sleeper agents of hiding amid Colombo's Tamil community.

5071	6793	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Nanayakkara denied the account, saying that rebels had experimented with using chemical weapons, but had never employed them in battle.
5072	6794	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"There was no burn agent," he said.
5073	6795	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The rebels have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese majority.

5085	6814	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The violence, which left as many as 200,000 dead, was prompted by the army's cancellation of 1992 legislative elections that an Islamist party was poised to win.
5086	6815	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The number of attacks had diminished before rising again dramatically after the GSPC in 2006 reaffirmed allegiance to al-Qaida.

5117	6872	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	He said Mitzna called him, and Ben-Eliezer pledged the Mitzna his support in the election campaign.

5121	6882	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The actual vote was expected to be trickle into party headquarters in Tel Aviv in the course of the evening.
5122	6886	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Likud leads the hawkish bloc of parties, and Labor the dovish one.
5123	6888	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``There's no reason in the world for us to be in the Gaza Strip,'' he said in an interview Tuesday morning as he toured party branches in the Tel Aviv area.
5124	6889	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``We will put our forces around Gaza, around the fence, protecting Israel.''
5125	6890	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said a Gaza withdrawal wouldn't depend on negotiations with the Palestinians, but that he also intended to resume talks without conditions.
5126	6892	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The bearded Mitzna said that if he became convinced that no agreement with the Palestinians was possible, he would pull out unilaterally from parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
5127	6897	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna acknowledged he might lose in January, but said his election as party leader would give Labor a stronger showing in parliament that would allow it to be a ``fighting opposition'' if it didn't win office.
5128	6898	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ben-Eliezer had said his appeal among more hawkish voters made him the better challenger to Likud since Mitzna would ``take us further to the left and keep us as the opposition for a long time.''
5129	6900	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said he wouldn't join a new unity government under the same formula that Labor joined Likud in the past, but said he would consider a coalition if Likud accepts his positions on disengaging from the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling settlements.
5130	6901	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``If we can make unity around separation from the Palestinians, OK.

5157	6941	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But the atmosphere remained tense between Fatah and Hamas, which share power in a unity government that has come under strain.

5166	6954	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
5167	6955	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
5168	6958	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence of what it calls a systemic failure.
5169	6960	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the current CIA director, and his predecessor, Porter J. Goss, have declined to seek disciplinary action against Tenet and others named in the report.
5170	6961	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The basic outlines of the report have been known since shortly after it was completed in 2005, but it had never been made public, and its release reignited a debate about whether the CIA should have done more before the attacks, and whether Tenet and other officials should be held accountable.
5171	6963	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.
5172	6964	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The summary of the report was released at the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
5173	6965	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The bitter dispute surrounding the report's release suggests the depth of anger that remains, nearly six years after the fact, over where blame should be assigned for the intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
5174	6966	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Among the lawmakers who voiced renewed anger at the CIA's decision not to discipline anyone was Rep. Rush D. Holt, D-N.J., a member of the House intelligence committee.
5175	6971	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of their errors amount to misconduct.
5176	6972	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
5177	6973	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It cited "failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow through with operations and to properly share and analyze critical data."
5178	6974	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report does not cite the names of the officials who it says "did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner," but it identifies some of them by their titles.
5179	6976	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	J. Cofer Black, the former director of the agency's Counterterrorist Center
5180	6977	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	and other top CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
5181	6978	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
5182	6979	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
5183	6980	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report cited the CIA's failure to pass intelligence about al- Mihdhar and al-Hamzi to other agencies as potentially significant.
5184	6981	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The CIA had identified the two men in January 2000 when they visited Malaysia, but never notified the State Department to put them on the terrorist watch list.
5185	6983	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure, and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida.
5186	6984	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before Sept. 11, 2001.
5187	6986	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden.
5188	6987	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said the standoff had prevented CIA officials from gaining access to transcripts of intercepted communications between terrorism suspects, and criticized Tenet for not interceding to resolve these turf battles.
5189	6988	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In describing the period prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, the report said the CIA had carried out "no comprehensive analysis that put into context the threats received in the spring and summer of 2001."
5190	6989	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
5191	6990	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
5192	6991	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a note to agency employees on Tuesday, Hayden made it clear that he continued to oppose the report's release.
5193	6992	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed," he said.
5194	6996	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.

5201	7007	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
5202	7008	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It needs someone with the courage of Martin Luther.
5203	7009	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
5204	7010	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
5205	7012	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
5206	7013	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for many verses -- especially those having to do with relations between Islam and other religions -- to be reinterpreted in favor of a more modern Islam.
5207	7014	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
5208	7016	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
5209	7017	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
5210	7018	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
5211	7019	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
5212	7020	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
5213	7021	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I prayed to God to give me the strength to overcome them.
5214	7023	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
5215	7024	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
5216	7025	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Viewing modern education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as they had been taught 1,200 years ago.
5217	7026	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
5218	7027	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1991, I took part in firebombing video stores in Riyadh and a women's center in my home town of Buraidah, seeing them as symbols of sin in a society that was marching rapidly toward modernization.
5219	7028	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
5220	7029	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
5221	7030	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he create it himself?
5222	7031	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
5223	7032	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	By the time I turned 26, much of the turmoil in me had abated, and I made my peace with God.
5224	7033	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
5225	7034	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I saw Islamic judges ignoring the marks of torture borne by my prison comrades.
5226	7035	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I learned of Islamic teachers who molested their students.
5227	7036	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
5228	7037	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me.

5230	7042	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
5231	7043	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some men in my mosque refused to greet me.
5232	7044	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
5233	7045	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
5234	7046	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
5235	7047	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
5236	7049	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
5237	7050	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
5238	7051	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
5239	7052	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
5240	7053	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I tried to give a new interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims and Christians and Jews.
5241	7054	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
5242	7055	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
5243	7056	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
5244	7057	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
5245	7058	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban my writing.
5246	7059	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I became a favorite target on the Internet, where my writings were lambasted and labeled blasphemous.
5247	7060	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
5248	7061	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
5249	7062	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt that He was moving me toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we pray to God from the heart.
5250	7063	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
5251	7064	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is great.''
5252	7065	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
5253	7066	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
5254	7067	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
5255	7068	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
5256	7069	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
5257	7070	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
5258	7071	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring my infidelity.
5259	7072	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of the verse of light.
5260	7073	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15, I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time.
5261	7074	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
5262	7075	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
5263	7076	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
5264	7077	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
5265	7078	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
5266	7079	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I believe that others can find it, too.
5267	7081	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
5268	7082	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his everlasting paradise.
5269	7083	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
5270	7084	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	he shared it only with a small, trusted circle of students.
5271	7085	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous uprising.
5272	7086	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.

5290	7111	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Real Madrid midfielder Emerson has denied refusing to appear as a substitute during the Champions League match with Bayern Munich.
5291	7113	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Madrid led the second-round first leg by 3-1 at the time but Bayern midfielder Mark Van Bommel then scored his team's second goal.
5292	7114	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Emerson, who reportedly didn't want to play as he hadn't warmed up on touchline with the rest of his teammates, said he couldn't "understand why this has been said."
5293	7115	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	"It's not true.
5294	7116	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	I'm a professional and I have never refused to play a match and particularly not with Capello, whom I have known for many years and who has known me," Emerson was quoted as saying by sports daily Marca on Thursday.
5295	7117	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	In a similar incident on Feb. 11, FC Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o faced suggestions he had refused to play as a substitute in a league game with Racing Santander.
5296	7118	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	An angry Eto'o responded two days later by railing against coach Frank Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.

5338	7186	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno became an umpire in part because of her frustration at not being able to play in organized leagues.

5363	7218	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The bewildering crisis in Lebanon has taken another perplexing twist with reports that the gridlocked parliament has agreed to choose the country's top general, Michel Suleiman, as its next president.
5364	7220	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The presidential selection process has been anything but free or fair.
5365	7222	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the power balance in parliament isn't based on election results
5366	7223	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	rather, it tracks the tally of assassinations.
5367	7224	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	After four anti-Syrian lawmakers were murdered, their colleagues have been holed up since September in the Phoenicia Hotel in Beirut, trying to hang on to their slim parliamentary majority by the simple expedient of staying alive.
5368	7226	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The vote to replace him has been delayed six times and is now scheduled for Dec. 6.
5369	7227	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The United States and France have supported the pro-democracy movement that drew more than a million people into the streets in the Cedar Revolution that succeeded in driving Syria from Lebanon in 2005.
5370	7228	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the West has not done enough since then to keep Syria or Hezbollah from paralyzing political progress.
5371	7232	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Enter Suleiman, who is no white knight but who might be able to keep Lebanon from a new civil war.
5372	7233	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Originally handpicked by the Syrians, Suleiman refused to use the army to crush pro-democracy demonstrators.
5373	7235	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Yet he enjoys close ties to Hezbollah and, as army chief, has allowed the smuggling of weapons from Syria to the Islamist fighters.
5374	7237	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But it should not allow Lebanon to again become ground zero in a proxy war sponsored by Syria and Iran.

5535	7454	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	Starting Tuesday, he donned military fatigues, a face mask and a red armband marking him as a volunteer trying to find survivors of his former neighbourhood.
5536	7455	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	He says that his team has saved some 700 people.
5537	7456	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	But so far not his wife or their parents.

5548	7469	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	"This morning our team saved four people but as time goes on our hopes are fading," Tang said on Thursday.

5560	7485	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The impact of higher food prices is particularly marked in poor countries where 75 percent of a family's revenues go on food, compared to rich countries where just 15 percent of a household's income is spent on meals.
5561	7487	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The country is particularly vulnerable as it depends on food imports from China and India, which are restricting exports, said Berthiaume.
5562	7488	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	In many countries, the only warm meal children get in a day is the meal served in school canteens, she added.

5564	7490	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	"They prefer to sell elsewhere at a higher price," said Berthiaume.
5565	7492	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	Food security has become a major concern in recent weeks as supplies of basic commodities have dwindled in the face of soaring demand, triggering riots and outbreaks of violence from Haiti to Indonesia.
5566	7493	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The World Bank on Sunday said a doubling of food prices over the past three years could push 100 million people in developing countries further into poverty.

5573	7505	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	And we're working to help prevent that from happening," Bush said in an interview with Fox News.

5575	7510	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"The people gave me the power I have, and it's within the framework of a constitution," Chavez said.
5576	7511	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Critics have called the measure giving Chavez sweeping powers to legislate as a move toward dictatorship.
5577	7516	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure that they're going to accept this because we are going to continue being partners.

5580	7519	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"One of the first laws will be the one to nationalize the electricity sector," Chavez said.
5581	7520	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	"It was a mistake to leave that sector in the hands of local and foreign owned private sector companies."

5583	7523	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Gasoline prices broke records again Monday as triple-digit oil prices kept pressure on the pump, giving Congress a well-timed set-up as it prepares to grill oil executives today on soaring energy costs.
5584	7524	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The national average price for regular unleaded climbed a fraction of a penny to $3.29 a gallon, up 12 cents from a month ago, AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report said.

5586	7526	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The records came on the eve of a congressional committee appearance by executives from the nation's five largest oil companies.
5587	7527	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The title of the hearing -- "Drilling for Answers: Oil Company Profits, Runaway Prices and Pursuit of Alternatives" -- hints at the reception industry leaders may expect from the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.
5588	7529	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	With pump prices high and the economy limping, U.S. gasoline demand has declined recently.
5589	7530	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	After growing at an average 1.5 percent for a decade, gasoline demand growth slowed to 0.4 percent in 2007 and demand is down 0.8 percent through the first 12 weeks of 2008, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
5590	7531	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	U.S. gasoline stockpiles have swollen nearly 10 percent above their five-year average in response, a situation that historically might have helped cool down pump prices.
5591	7533	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The price of crude, which typically accounts for about 48 percent of the price of gasoline, accounts for 70 percent of the pump price today, he said.
5592	7534	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Weak returns refiners have posted recently attest to the industry's struggle to absorb higher crude costs, Felmy said.
5593	7535	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	On Monday, light, sweet crude for May delivery fell $4.04 to $101.58 in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
5594	7536	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	But it is still up more than 50 percent from a year ago.
5595	7537	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The difference between what refiners pay for a barrel of oil and the price they get for products made from it is known as the gross refining margin.
5596	7538	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	This figure is widely used as a rough indicator of the profitability of the refining business.

5600	7543	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Refining margins often rise sharply in the spring and summer months as gasoline demand increases during the vacation season.
5601	7544	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The government anticipates pump prices will peak at a monthly average of $3.50 a gallon sometime this spring as vacation driving begins, topping $4 in some markets.
5602	7545	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	If that holds true, the price will surpass the inflation-adjusted record of $3.40 a gallon set in March 1981.
5603	7546	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"Gas prices are outrageous," said John Jardell, 33, as he paid $20 to pump six gallons into his 1995 Lexus sedan Monday at a Texaco station at Richmond and U.S. 59.

5609	7552	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Declining gasoline demand, flush fuel inventories and rising ethanol output should have eased pump prices, the Consumer Federation of America said.
5610	7553	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Instead, the industry has used its market power to cut production and maintain that pressure, the group said.
5611	7554	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	API officials flatly denied that allegation Monday.
5612	7555	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"There's no way you can make those claims," Felmy said in a conference call.

5614	7558	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	"I've never seen a credible allegation that private oil companies have much market power in crude oil, which appears to be the biggest driver," Seesel said.
5615	7559	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The FTC has investigated the refining industry in the past for possible price manipulation and found nothing, he said.

5663	7631	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Inc. on Monday, accusing the drugmaker of defrauding the main health benefit program for the poor and other government insurance programs by hiding the risks of heart problems associated with its pain medication Vioxx.
5664	7633	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	For its residents receiving Medicaid assistance, New York City paid a substantial share of those costs.
5665	7634	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit says tens of millions of dollars (euros) were paid for prescriptions for patients with preexisting heart conditions.
5666	7635	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Those funds would not have been spent had the risks associated with Vioxx been known, court papers say.
5667	7637	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, removed Vioxx from the market in Sept. 30, 2004 because it doubled risk of heart attack and stroke.
5668	7638	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Before stopping Vioxx sales, court papers say, Merck "undertook a concerted and tenacious campaign of false and fraudulent statements to minimize the import and seriousness" of the possible association between Vioxx and heart problems.
5669	7639	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	This "disinformation campaign" continued until a month before Merck ceased sales of the drug, causing New York doctors to continue writing prescriptions for Vioxx that they otherwise would not have written, according to the lawsuit.
5670	7641	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that our behavior has been responsible," Jarrell said, adding that similar lawsuits seeking reimbursement for insurance costs have been filed in "a handful" of other states.
5671	7642	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit asks that Merck be ordered to pay New York City and the state three times their damages, to be determined at trial.
5672	7643	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	It also asks that Merck be required to pay the state a civil penalty of $12,000 (euro8,647) for each false claim, and $15,000 (euro10,809) to the city for each such violation.

5678	7649	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she created that uses computer play to teach reading.
5679	7650	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for children.
5680	7651	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" launched by Sabi Inc. immerses children in an animated world that they control and shape by using software developed by Microsoft Labs.

5682	7653	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for kids gaming," Johnson said.
5683	7654	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"We wanted to have a fun game fine-tuned to the way children learn," she said.
5684	7655	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity stakes in firms.
5685	7657	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Sabi consulted learning specialists and brought in engineers that worked on videogames for Microsoft's XBox 360 consoles and computers running the Windows operating system.
5686	7658	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	They set out to create a computer game for children that bolsters reading skills along with creative expression.
5687	7659	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Out of that came Living Ink, which we hope delights children in that what they draw comes to life and they interact with it," Johnson said.
5688	7660	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"What has happened in the edutainment field is games feel like work.
5689	7661	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	It is our goal and passion to establish this category of games that children actually think are fun and, you know what, you happen to start reading."
5690	7662	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Some believe that the education entertainment computer game industry has languished because titles tend to take on the appearance of interactive school assignments based on academic curricula.
5691	7663	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
5692	7664	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market," said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures Program.
5693	7665	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"There aren't that many games today that offer the rich, engaging experience of other games with the educational component.

5731	7715	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	years now, is to show the power of sports to impact lives."
5732	7716	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb's life changed in a matter of 24 hours, when he visited the Basketball Hall of Fame for the first time on Sept. 10, 2001 (his 39th birthday), and lamented the absence of an all-sports museum in the United States.
5733	7717	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The attacks the next day spurred him to pursue his goal of a museum that would celebrate all sports, and to build it in Manhattan.
5734	7718	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Sixteen months later, the Basketball Hall of Fame became the first partner.
5735	7719	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb speaks warmly of the first athlete to join the advisory board, Celtics legend Bob Cousy.
5736	7720	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We call Bob our patron saint," said Schwalb.
5737	7721	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Cousy, a New York native, was also the subject of a rallying cry when the fledgling museum was trying to gain its footing.
5738	7722	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The mayor had given us the use of Gracie Mansion for a meeting with the deputy mayor for economic development, and we wanted noteworthy athletes to join us," said Schwalb.
5739	7723	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We had four or five lined up, but as time went on the others kept canceling.
5740	7724	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Finally, only Cousy was left, so our slogan was 'Don't lose the Cooz."'
5741	7725	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Another Hall of Famer, Bill Bradley, steered the project toward Lower Manhattan, which resulted in Schwalb's group securing Liberty bonds, part of a federal initiative to revitalize the area.
5742	7726	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a dozen or so businesses out of some 300 applicants won approval, and that landed the museum $60 million of its required $100 million.

5746	7731	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	What did those organizations have to gain?
5747	7732	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	As in many sports stories, the statistics are telling.
5748	7733	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"In the case of the Basketball Hall of Fame, they work hard, they hold special events, and they get just over 100,000 visitors a year," says Schwalb.
5749	7734	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"There must be what, 30 million basketball fans in this country?
5750	7735	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	And a lot of them don't even know the Hall of Fame is in Springfield."

5752	7737	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum is about 50 yards from the park, right across the street from the famous "charging bull" statue symbolic of Wall Street, a couple of blocks from Ground Zero, and at the starting point for ticker-tape parades down Broadway, the mile-long "Canyon of Heroes" leading to City Hall.
5753	7739	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We also have a photo of Jesse Owens in a convertible during his parade in 1936 that was taken directly in front of our building," said Schwalb.
5754	7740	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum sits at 26 Broadway and boasts a commanding presence in the historic former headquarters of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co.

5770	7757	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The siblings' chain-reaction quest for holy war was ignited in 2003, when Qabil Nasri, a tall man with a sparse beard, was imprisoned on terrorism charges.
5771	7758	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	His case radicalized his siblings, two of whom were arrested after sneaking into neighboring Algeria to train with Islamist militants.
5772	7759	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A third was caught before he crossed the mountainous border to join them.
5773	7760	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Nasri was freed in 2005
5774	7761	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	his brothers, including a former police officer, are still in prison.
5775	7763	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The nation wears an intriguing facade.
5776	7764	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Women enjoy a degree of liberation, men in suits have their shoes polished while reading newspapers on the sidewalks -- and secret police slip in and out of lives like uninvited guests.
5777	7766	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nasri brothers and thousands of young Tunisians like them epitomize the intersection of ideological currents and technological wizardry fueling Islamic extremism across North Africa.
5778	7768	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"A young man cannot find true Islam in state-sanctioned religion," Nasri said.
5779	7769	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"So a young man, with all his power, starts searching for messages on TV and the Internet.
5780	7770	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... Young Tunisians are peaceful, but when we face pressures because we are religious, our thoughts start to change.
5781	7771	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Why are we subjected to this?
5782	7772	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Why are they attacking my religion?
5783	7773	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Eventually, a young man starts to think that his government is the enemy of Islam."
5784	7775	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's a great concern for all North Africans," he said.
5785	7776	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"But these Islamist militants don't have the appeal of the Islamists of decades past.
5786	7777	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They're a very radical sub-phenomenon.
5787	7778	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They are influenced by radical organizations that operate across borders.
5788	7779	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	But our security forces are ready.
5789	7780	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	We are careful and vigilant."
5790	7781	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A Western diplomat who requested anonymity said, "I think the Tunisians are beginning to wake up.
5791	7782	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They used to see it as a blip: `Let these young guys go to Iraq -- what do we care?'
5792	7783	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	But now they're dealing with these guys coming home."
5793	7784	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2005, about 300 Tunisians were jailed for religious-inspired militant activity.
5794	7787	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The extremists, including Tunisians and a Mauritanian, were part of a group that trained in Algeria and allegedly was planning attacks on the U.S. and other Western embassies in Tunis.
5795	7792	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The veil has swept the streets, and the Islamists are here," Ben Amor said.

5798	7796	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They are of the sons she has lost to Islamic militancy.
5799	7797	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The younger, Marwen, was studying business at a university when he left to fight in Iraq, where he died in Fallujah in 2004.
5800	7798	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The older, Maher, was an engineering student whose college ID card was confiscated by police, who told him he wouldn't get it back until he shaved off his beard.
5801	7799	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He is now serving a 10-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist organization.
5802	7800	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed mourns her sons less than she celebrates what they have done.
5803	7801	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"Our government doesn't have any sovereignty.
5804	7802	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	It does the work of the Americans and the Zionists," she said.
5805	7803	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The religious resurgence is much stronger here than it was in the 1990s.
5806	7804	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	This new movement includes the rich and the poor, the rural and the city, and the religious and those who had not been religious before.
5807	7805	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"My sons were depressed at Friday prayers and by the sermons they heard from government-controlled preachers.
5808	7806	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	They looked for the true version of Islam on TV, the Internet and in banned books."
5809	7807	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed sat next to another mother, Noura Ben Slimene, whose pale, angular face seemed to glow against a black hijab.
5810	7808	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Her son, Anas, fought with the insurgency in Baghdad and died, she said, in a U.S. airstrike along the Iraqi-Syrian border.
5811	7809	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"He came to me and said, `I'm going to Iraq.
5812	7810	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I need my passport.
5813	7811	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I'm prepared to do this for God,' " Slimene said.
5814	7812	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"I felt the same way about the injustice he saw.
5815	7813	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I was convinced he was going to fight injustice.
5816	7814	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... In the neighborhood where I live, the police arrest many people who feel like my son."
5817	7818	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The government licensed mosques, banned religion-influenced political parties and stripped national identity cards from 10,000 to 15,000 suspected radicals.
5818	7819	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Human-rights groups complained that the measures violated religious freedom.
5819	7820	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The radicalism today is the result of Tunisia not allowing even moderate Islam to exist," said Ali Larayedh, a member of Nahda who spent 14 years in prison.
5820	7821	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"But this radicalism is not a large part of the Islamist revival we're seeing in Tunisia.
5821	7822	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... The government is exaggerating the radical threat to justify the blockade it imposes on Islam."
5822	7823	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A young man with a receding hairline sat in a wind breaker, his hands nervously folded.
5823	7824	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He would give his name only as Abdel.
5824	7825	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2003, he was one of six men and boys charged with downloading subversive Internet files and trying to make a bomb in the southern town of Zarzis.
5825	7826	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He was 17 when he went to prison and 20 when he was freed.
5826	7827	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The case became a national sensation, pitting a government wanting to show it was fighting terrorism against critics who claimed security forces were exaggerating Islamic threats and making arrests to impress the United States.
5827	7828	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The police said I was a Salafi, a radical.
5828	7829	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I didn't know what Salafi meant back then," Abdel said.

5830	7831	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	My face was paralyzed for a while.

5833	7834	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I've noticed young Tunisians have changed a lot since I went into prison.

5843	7845	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Nasri has remained defiant.
5844	7846	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Because his young face wears a light beard, most employers, under government pressure, will not hire him.

5887	7923	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua)
5888	7925	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	NTAI chairperson Peter Mangani said here Wednesday the taskforce has drawn up a budget of 12 million U.S. dollars for the creation of the national capacity to respond to a possible outbreak of the disease.
5889	7926	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	Mangani said a national response plan had also been worked out with emphasis on public awareness, surveillance and development of reliable diagnostic capacity in the prevention of the bird flu outbreak in the country.
5890	7927	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	He said the taskforce which comprises ministries of agriculture, health and information would remain alert in ensuring that the disease would not spread to Zambia from other African nations like Egypt and Nigeria.
5891	7929	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	A total of 291 cases of bird flu has been reported worldwide between 2003 and 2007 among human beings out of which 172 have died, NTAI said.

5893	7932	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The Arab League is in dire financial straits because most of its 22 member states haven't paid all their annual contributions, said an internal report obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.
5894	7935	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	Member states have paid only 86 percent of their contributions due for 2006 and 2007, said the report, stating that members owed US$88 million (euro55.75 million) in contribution arrears.
5895	7936	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The League's annual budget runs at about US$36 million, with most of the contributions coming from oil-rich countries likes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
5896	7937	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	But the report showed that some wealthy Gulf countries such as Qatar and Kuwait have reservations on their share of the budget --despite a boom in oil prices that has generated billions of dollars of additional revenues-- while poor nations like Somalia and Djibouti can't afford to pay their due.
5897	7942	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Jung said it was unclear how serious the contamination was.
5898	7943	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The region is popular for its scenic beaches and is also the site of fish farms, a national maritime park and is an important rest stop for migrating birds.
5899	7944	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters
5900	7945	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	2.7 million gallons) of oil gushed Friday from the Hong Kong-registered tanker after a crane-carrying barge slammed into it.
5901	7946	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The spill was the country's largest, involving twice as much oil as the worst previous spill in 1995.
5902	7947	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The accident occurred about 7 miles (11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach.
5903	7948	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Strong winds and prevailing currents have spread the oil slick to an area about 1 mile (2 kilometers) wide and 10 miles (20 kilometers) in length, Jung said.
5904	7949	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	YTN television showed a contaminated beach, with some rocks and sand stained in black.
5905	7950	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The Coast Guard planned to mobilize 103 vessels and six helicopters Saturday in an effort to clean it up, Jung said, adding that the operation was expected to take at least three days.
5906	7951	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	"We're doing our best to remove the contamination as quickly as possible, but it will take some time to clean up the shore because it needs to be done by hand," said Kim Woon-tae, a Coast Guard official stationed in the region.
5907	7952	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Kim said oil was still trickling out of the punctured tanker, but the hole would soon be sealed completely.
5908	7953	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Chang Geun-ho, an official of the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry, said Friday that the extent of environmental damage would depend on the success of the containment operation, though he added that cold winter temperatures could help slow the spread of the oil slick by freezing it.
5909	7954	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The size of the leak reported by the authorities would be about one-fourth that of the 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons, of oil spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
5910	7956	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	There were no casualties in the accident, it said.
5911	7958	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to high winds, waves and currents, he said.
5912	7959	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Kim said the Coast Guard planned to question the barge's captain to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy weather.
5913	7960	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The July 1995 leak caused damage estimated at 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million).

5952	8010	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	Biomet, which makes joint replacement devices and other orthopedic products, said its board unanimously recommended the deal to shareholders.
5953	8011	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	The private equity funds backing Biomet's buyout -- Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. and TPG -- had struck a deal last year for a 10.9 billion-dollar acquisition.
5954	8012	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	But last month, Institutional Shareholder Services, a research firm for shareholders, recommended against the deal, saying it was low in view of the growing market for prosthetic devices.

5962	8024	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Cars, bank notes and TVs were going up in flames one chilly winter morning in the parking lot of Universal Chung Wah Funeral Home in Alhambra, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
5963	8025	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Thirteen white-clad relatives of Dam Lam, 87, formed a circle, each cradling a stack of paper models: a foot-long 747 jetliner, a black-and-gold car sitting in the courtyard of a 2-foot-tall, red-tiled paper mansion.
5964	8026	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	One by one, the items were thrown into the fire licking out of a 4-by-4-foot wheeled container, charred from years of use.
5965	8027	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam would need the items in heaven, his family said.
5966	8029	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Traditionally, stacks of bamboo or rice paper bank notes were burned in braziers before the body of the deceased was lowered into the ground.
5967	8033	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Many believe that spirits spend the month sniffing for souls to take, prompting the superstitious to crowd dzi-dzat stores looking for offerings to appease dead relatives.
5968	8036	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"For some people who cannot buy the actual items, they pursue the desire in the paper-goods form," said Xin Zhao, a professor of international marketing at the University of Hawaii.
5969	8037	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"It's like vicariously having them."
5970	8038	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lately, Southern California Chinese have become very particular about what they take to heaven, opting for fashionable upgrades of older dzi-dzat models, funeral workers said.
5971	8039	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Which explains the paper cell phones, paper DVD players, paper jewelry and clothing.
5972	8040	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	It also explains why mourners purchase paper laptops: so their dead kin can keep track of the paper credit cards that came with them.
5973	8041	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	At Lam's funeral in December, several paper cars, including a gray sedan with a red-jacketed chauffeur behind the plastic windshield, were parked on the altar amid mounds of pears, apples and pomelo.
5974	8042	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam was a simple man with a gentle soul, according to his son, Konn Lam, 37.
5975	8043	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Born in Guangzhou, China, he got married in Vietnam, raised his four children in Hong Kong and moved to Alhambra in the 1980s.
5976	8044	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	He made some money in the import-export business but also endured some financial difficulties.
5977	8045	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Now, Lam's family wanted to give him all the luxuries that eluded him in life.
5978	8047	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	White flowers framed a large photo of Lam on an altar, which about 25 mourners approached with incense sticks, bowing as the sutras continued playing over speakers.
5979	8048	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Smoke from incense sticks curled under the gold and silver paper bridges that Lam's spirit was expected to cross, near a golden servant boy and a silver servant girl.
5980	8049	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Strips of yellow paper listing Lam's name and the date of the ceremony hung from each offering, like a letter to be sent to an afterlife address.
5981	8050	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Outside, during the burning, two attendants chanted Lam's name after each toss, also reciting the name of the object and a short verse symbolically delivering the goods into the afterlife.
5982	8051	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Within minutes, the intricate models settled into ash.
5983	8052	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The mourners bowed three times toward the bin, then went back inside to finish the funeral.
5984	8054	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A wide variety of paper goods -- kitchen utensils, trendy paper pumps -- are strung up like pinatas over spreads of candles and religious figurines.

5986	8057	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Perched nearby, a papier-mache tabby with plastic whiskers and a lush coat of paper strips glares through beaded eyes at a paper microwave.
5987	8059	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The paper products usually cost between $5 and $30, she said.

5992	8064	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Kwan started receiving custom requests: a paper wheelchair for someone who was disabled, paper fishing poles for an avid fly- fisher.
5993	8065	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And, appropriately for car-crazed Los Angeles, Kwan is often asked for a specific paper Honda model with silver rims, or a BMW in a particular color.
5994	8066	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the U.S., as is the pool of qualified artisans, she said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.

5996	8068	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Mourners in Asia certainly have no problem burning -- literally -- through money.
5997	8070	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And although China's economic renaissance has softened most regional authorities toward the ritual, burning paper replicas is still officially banned in most of the country.Communist ideology does not recognize filial piety and life after death.
5998	8071	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The air pollution from burning paper also don't help, said Zhao, the professor.
5999	8072	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Communist government has also commented on what it views as inappropriate items for burning.
6000	8073	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Apparently the afterlife has a booming red-light district.
6001	8074	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In April 2006, China's deputy secretary of the Ministry of Civil Affairs prohibited the burning of "adult" items such as paper condoms, karaoke hostesses and Viagra.
6002	8075	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	U.S. funeral directors and merchants predict the ritual is headed for a downturn, however, as the community becomes more assimilated.
6003	8076	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Younger, American-born Chinese avoid Kwan's shop, she said, because many do not understand the paper-burning tradition.

6007	8084	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
6008	8085	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
6009	8086	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East.
6010	8087	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the United States" and its national security.
6011	8089	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"I'm not surprised at all," he said.
6012	8090	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"It's typical for this Republican administration to ignore environmental protections under the banner of fear."
6013	8091	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and ears.
6014	8092	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
6015	8093	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been fighting the Navy's sonar training, said the group would challenge Bush's exemption.
6016	8094	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises.
6017	8095	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar would have to be shut down when mammals were spotted within 2,200 yards (2,010 meters).
6018	8096	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
6019	8098	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other marine mammals.
6020	8099	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.
6021	8100	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might threaten its ships.

6037	8125	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	But subsequent investigations revealed that most of the children were Chadians with living parents or adults they regarded as parents.

6039	8128	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Collard insisted that the defense team had "all the evidence to show that it was not kidnapping but a desire to save children in a humanitarian context."
6040	8130	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Collard had said Thursday his clients were "very tired, very depressed, very discouraged.
6041	8131	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The hunger strike has made them very weak and the situation is really tragic."
6042	8132	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The parents of many of the children say that they were told their children would be going to school in Chad, and there was no mention of a trip to France.
6043	8133	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Other children said they were lured away from their families with sweets.
6044	8134	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The aid workers also reportedly applied fake blood and bandages to the children, although none of them had been wounded, in preparation for a planned flight to France.

6047	8143	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Report: Deutsche Telekom CEO asks for patience from shareholders
6048	8144	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2008-05-11 13:03:15 UTC
6049	8145	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Telekom AG's chief executive has asked that shareholders show patience, pointing to the global credit crisis as a reason for the company's lackluster share price, according to an interview published Sunday.
6050	8146	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Rene Obermann took over as head of Europe's biggest telecom company in late 2006.
6051	8147	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Last week, the company reported a rise in first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.
6052	8148	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Telekom shares, worth nearly euro13.50 when Obermann took over, closed at euro11.81 (US$18.29) on Friday.
6053	8149	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"I want to show shareholders what great potential our company has
6054	8150	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	and I want to make clear how great an effort we are making to increase the value of the company," Obermann was quoted as telling the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
6055	8151	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	However, "I can't perform magic," he added.
6056	8152	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"This is hard work that requires trust and patience."
6057	8153	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann noted that Telekom shares performed strongly until January.
6058	8154	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"Only with the credit crisis did the whole industry -- so our competitors as well -- fall back," he added, according to the report.
6059	8155	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann said that his company's marketing of Apple's iPhone in Germany, where it is available only with a two-year contract from Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit, has been "attractive and profitable."
6060	8156	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	He was quoted as saying that it has sold more than 100,000 of the devices in Germany so far.
6061	8157	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann brushed aside a question as to whether Deutsche Telekom wants to buy U.S. mobile phone rival Sprint Nextel Corp.
6062	8158	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"It is our general policy not to comment on such market rumors," he said.
6063	8159	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"That would be irresponsible."
6064	8161	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip 2007-12-02 16:54:35 UTC
6065	8164	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	About 50 others who were expected to pass today are now scheduled to be released tomorrow, Yassin said.
6066	8166	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We intend to continue to get as many people as possible out of Gaza over the next few days," Yassin said.
6067	8168	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Gaza's border crossings closed since June, when the Islamic militant Hamas seized control of the territory.
6068	8169	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a time.
6069	8170	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
6070	8171	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	One of the protesters, Salman Fawaz, 55, said he worked as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia and had been home for a visit when Hamas seized control and the borders closed.
6071	8172	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	His work visa in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of those allowed to leave.
6072	8174	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"Both are responsible for our suffering," Fawaz said.
6073	8177	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"It's possible to have an effective, efficient mechanism that will get the human beings of Gaza and out of the enormous jail they are in."
6074	8178	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Michael Moore to release new film online for free
6075	8180	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Inspired by Neil Young and Radiohead, Michael Moore will release his new film online and for free.
6076	8181	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The film, "Slacker Uprising," follows Moore's 62-city tour during the 2004 election to rally young voters.
6077	8183	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	An official announcement of the film is planned for Friday.
6078	8185	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Instead, Moore opted for a symbol of gratitude to his fans as he approaches the 20th anniversary of his first film, 1989's "Roger &amp
6079	8186	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Me."
6080	8187	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate my 20th year of doing this," Moore said.
6081	8188	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"And also help get out the vote for November.
6082	8189	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	I've been thinking about what I want to do to help with the election this year."
6083	8190	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The 97-minute long "Slacker Uprising" will be the first major film to be released in such a way.
6084	8191	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Last December, "Jackass 2.5" was streamed online and for free, but that was only a collection of left over material from "Jackass 2."
6085	8192	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Companies like ClickStar, which Morgan Freeman co-founded, have made films still in theaters -- such as 2006's "10 Items or Less" -- digitally available for purchase or rental.
6086	8193	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Experimentation in distribution has been more common in the music industry, where the Internet has significantly damaged traditional business models.
6087	8194	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore took notice when Radiohead last year released their seventh album, "In Rainbows," online with optional pricing.
6088	8195	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	In 2006, Neil Young streamed his anti-war album "Living With War" for free before its standard release -- now a more common practice.
6089	8196	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	If history is any measure, "Slacker Uprising" could have made a decent sum in theaters.
6090	8197	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	His last two films, "Sicko" ($24 million) and "Fahrenheit 9/11" ($119 million) are two of the three highest grossing documentaries ever.
6091	8198	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore said that "Slacker Uprising" cost about $2 million to make and that he will end up paying about $1 million out of his pocket.
6092	8199	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Neither he nor the distributor, Brave New Films, plan to profit from the release.
6093	8200	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The director's last film, "Sicko," leaked online and was downloaded illegally in large numbers.
6094	8201	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	He says this download, offered by BlipTV, will be high-resolution and far better than "YouTube quality."
6095	8202	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	To receive the download, people can sign up at SlackerUprising.com.
6096	8203	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A "Night of a Thousand House Parties" is planned for Oct. 4, when local neighborhood screenings are hoped to be scheduled.
6097	8204	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A DVD will be released Oct. 7.
6098	8205	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore last week released a paperback book, "Mike's Election Guide 2008" and is currently working on a movie for theatrical release next year.
6099	8206	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	That film is expected to examine America as an empire, but the director declined to discuss any details about it.
6100	8207	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	For now, Moore hopes "Slacker Uprising" will help spur young people to vote this November.
6101	8208	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	After more than 20 million 18 to 29 -year-olds cast ballots in 2004 (an 11 percent increase from 2000), he's hoping even greater numbers of "slackers" vote this year.
6102	8209	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore readily acknowledges this a film for Democrats.
6103	8210	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"This film, really isn't for anybody other than the choir," said Moore.
6104	8211	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"But that's because I believe the choir needs a song to sing every now and then."

6109	8217	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The year automakers have been dreading has begun.
6110	8218	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts forecast U.S. sales could fall by as many as 1 million vehicles in January compared to the same month last year, bearing out predictions that 2008 could be the worst year for automakers in more than a decade.
6111	8219	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers report January sales on Friday.
6112	8221	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toprak and others predict January sales will be down 3 percent and that few automakers will escape unscathed.
6113	8222	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	January sales are normally lower after the holiday rush in December.
6114	8223	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	But analysts say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when automakers introduce new products and the election brings political uncertainty to an end.
6115	8224	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, buyers are skittish.
6116	8225	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy in January than they had been in December.
6117	8226	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The group said most of the 5,000 U.S. households surveyed expect business conditions and employment to deteriorate further in the months ahead.
6118	8227	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts say that will have a direct affect on the auto industry.
6119	8229	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
6120	8231	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Barry predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993.
6121	8232	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Other analysts forecast higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales will likely fall below 16 million.
6122	8233	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers sold 16.3 million vehicles in 2007.
6123	8234	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit sales to rental-car fleets.
6124	8235	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Ford reduced rental fleet sales by 32 percent in 2007 and has vowed to make more -- although less aggressive -- cuts in 2007.
6125	8237	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the line on incentive spending.
6126	8238	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers have been trying to rely less on costly incentives, and Nesvold said the level of December spending -- an average of $2,746 (euro1,854) per vehicle industrywide -- was down from a year earlier.
6127	8239	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Still, December spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to shore up the market with incentives.
6128	8240	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	That trend could get worse before it gets better.

6163	8288	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	Peter Fulton has been elevated to the opening slot vacated by the injured Lou Vincent as New Zealand seeks a quick solution ahead of Thursday's Super 8s game against the West Indies.
6164	8291	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"Peter's been in outstanding form," said Fleming, referring to the batsman who came to the World Cup with half-centuries in three of his last four innings, but missed out on some preliminary round matches.
6165	8292	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"It was an incredibly difficult decision to leave Peter out of the first few games," said Fleming.
6166	8293	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"He's now getting a bat in one position for a while."
6167	8294	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	In his previous 29 one-dayers, the 28-year-old Fulton's position kept switching between No.3 and No.4.
6168	8296	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	McCullum had been tried as an opener by New Zealand, but then shifted back to the middle order where he had more success with the bat.

6174	8304	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Russia had crossed "an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia," and should "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces," said McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in a hastily arranged statement delivered on an airport tarmac.
6175	8307	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war," Obama said in a statement issued by his campaign.
6176	8310	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama might respond to a crisis with international implications.
6177	8313	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has been criticized for cracking down on demonstrators last year, but McCain has been a loyal and longtime ally.
6178	8314	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	McCain first heard about the crisis shortly before leaving Cincinnati for Des Moines on Friday morning, and to gather more information he made phone calls from his car on the way to the airport.
6179	8316	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Scheunemann, who has worked for McCain's campaign since early 2007, took a leave from his firm, Orion Strategies LLC, in March of this year.
6180	8317	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of the statement.
6181	8318	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He delivered it on the tarmac upon landing in Des Moines.
6182	8319	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama's response came in several stages.
6183	8321	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama was more judgmental in his own statement later on Friday, and by Saturday his campaign stepped up the rhetoric once again.
6184	8323	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Clearly Russia bears the responsibility for that escalation."
6185	8324	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Aides said Obama was also briefed by Hadley on Friday and was kept informed on developments by his foreign policy advisers as he flew to Hawaii.
6186	8328	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	and Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic representative of Indiana, who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center.
6187	8329	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Both campaigns also used the crisis to engage in their now-daily political combat, which in this round focused on Scheunemann and his ties to Georgia.
6188	8331	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter, of the McCain campaign, dismissed the criticism.
6189	8332	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"In the middle of an international crisis, in which people are getting killed, the best the Obama campaign can come up with is to cast aspersions on a McCain staffer," he said.
6190	8333	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter acknowledged that Scheunemann had lobbied for Georgia, but said that McCain "has been involved in the efforts of former Soviet Republics to embrace democracy and free-market values since the end of the Cold War."

6197	8347	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	In Egypt, which has been particularly criticized for joining Israel in closing its borders with Gaza, thousands of people rallied, calling for the active intervention of Arab armies to protect the Palestinians.
6198	8348	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	Demonstrations were held near the parliament building and in downtown Cairo amid a massive security presence of black-clad riot police.
6199	8349	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	Demonstrations in the tourist destination of Luxor, however, were prevented.
6200	8350	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	The largest protest, a crowd of up to 3,000 people outside the Journalists' Union, was organized by the opposition Muslim Brotherhood, and in an unusual move, the Islamist organization's Supreme Guide Mohammed Mahdi Akef took part, urging the crowd to make "their declaration of anger through peaceful means."
6201	8351	APW_ENG_20081229.0589.LDC2009T13	In Iran, a prominent conservative political party announced it is registering volunteers to fight against Israel in response to the attacks on Gaza.

6206	8366	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	When it comes to supplying the United States with oil, Africa is quietly trumping the Middle East.
6207	8367	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude oil imports from Africa topped supplies from the Middle East in 2006 for the first time in 21 years, recent government data show.
6208	8368	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent, or 1.3 million barrels a day.
6209	8369	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Now, the fractional edge given to African crude oil suppliers underscores a number of market changes and may grow wider in coming years.
6210	8370	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Surging growth from Asia -- led by China, where oil demand is expected to grow 6.2 percent this year -- is drawing huge volumes of Middle East crude.
6211	8371	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. market, output constraints from aging oil fields in Mexico and Venezuela are weighing on imports from those countries.
6212	8372	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude supplies from Africa and the Middle East each accounted for a 22 percent share of U.S. crude imports, but in actual physical supplies, Africa's flow topped the Middle East by 8,000 barrels a day.
6213	8373	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude from Africa, at 2.23 million barrels a day, was the highest since 1979 and a 4.8 percent jump from 2005.
6214	8374	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The 22 percent share -- the biggest in 25 years -- compares with 21 percent last year and a share of less than 13 percent in 2002.
6215	8375	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The volume of U.S. crude imports from the Middle East, at 2.22 million barrels a day, dipped just 20,000 barrels a day on the year, but marks the third straight annual decline.
6216	8376	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The flow of Middle East crude into the United States was at the lowest level since 1998 and the 22 percent share is the slimmest since 1997.
6217	8378	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Major producers such as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil exporter -- and other Middle East producers have targeted more volumes to China and India, where they've also built joint ventures to sell petroleum products.
6218	8379	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia saw its third straight decline in crude supply to the U.S. market, with a 1.7 percent dip to 1.42 million barrels a day, the lowest volume since 1999.
6219	8380	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Supplies from other traditional top suppliers Mexico and Venezuela are raising concern, due to declines in output.
6220	8381	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from output-constrained Caracas slumped 8.2 percent.
6221	8382	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	While Venezuela held its fourth-place ranking among U.S. crude suppliers, the volume of 1.139 million barrels a day was the lowest in any year since 1994.
6222	8383	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Oil producers in Africa have picked up the slack.

6226	8387	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	However, U.S. imports from Nigeria -- Africa's biggest oil producer -- dropped 3.2 percent on the year to 1.043 million barrels a day, the lowest level since 2003 as civil unrest in the oil-producing Delta region disrupted supplies throughout the year.
6227	8388	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Canada remains the top U.S. crude supplier, a title it has held each year since 2004, when it eclipsed Saudi Arabia.

6256	8428	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Families of more than 180 miners trapped in flooded coal mines in eastern China and presumed dead lashed out at one of the companies Tuesday, complaining it had ignored safety warnings to close.
6257	8429	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Rescue workers were pumping water in a bid to reach 172 miners missing for four days in the Huayuan mine and nine others in a smaller mine run by another company "despite dim hopes for anyone to survive," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
6258	8430	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The miners have been trapped since Friday afternoon when a dike collapsed, several hours after other mines in the area had pulled their workers to the surface because of flooding fears.
6259	8431	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"The news reports say it is a natural disaster because of the rain, but the accident is because of the mine management.
6260	8432	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Every year there is flooding," said Ma Xiumei, who came with her sister to the mine headquarters in Xintai, Shandong province, for information about their missing brother.
6261	8433	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"If these miners are safely brought home we won't say a thing, but if it is the worst then they (the company) need to think about my younger brother's laid-off wife, his children, his aging mother," said Ma Xiuhua.
6262	8434	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	At least two other mines in the area have said that worries about unusually heavy rains had prompted them to shut down Friday morning, raising questions about why the Huayuan Mining Co. continued to operate.
6263	8435	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The state-run China Daily also reported Tuesday that relatives were complaining about "human error."
6264	8436	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It quoted one worker as saying the mine had flooded every year since 2002.
6265	8437	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Huayuan also reportedly received six phone calls from the Xintai Administration for Work Safety on Friday, before the accident, but took no action," the newspaper reported.
6266	8438	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It said the administration urged local mines to stop production and evacuate mines during torrential rainstorms.
6267	8440	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Calls to the company and to the safety administration were not answered Tuesday.
6268	8441	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The company and local government appeared to be isolating families and pressuring them to keep their anger in check after one family attacked a Huayuan office with sticks on Monday.
6269	8442	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some neighborhoods with a lot of mining families have been sealed off, with plain-clothed guards keeping outsiders away.
6270	8443	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some families have also been taken away and put up in hotels in the main center of Xintai, a 15-minute drive from the mining company offices.
6271	8444	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	One person who managed to sneak away from a hotel said the families had been told not to talk to each other.

6273	8446	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Don't make a big thing about this, you have to think about your brother's job," the woman said.
6274	8447	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Ma Xiumei said the woman worked for the mining company.
6275	8448	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Security officials have also been trailing reporters in Xintai, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of Beijing.

6277	8451	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Coal feeds most of China's energy needs, and accidents kill an average of 13 miners a day.
6278	8452	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Tempers among the miners' families boiled over Monday.
6279	8453	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Several relatives of a missing miner used wooden sticks to smash a reception window and display cases at a company office.

6397	8618	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	European aviation giant Airbus on Tuesday announced more delays to the delivery of its giant A380 superjumbos, saying the current schedule was not one it could meet.
6398	8619	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be able to deliver 12 of the aircraft in 2008 instead of the 13 previously announced, and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had earlier said it could manage, a statement said.
6399	8620	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A review that led to the revised schedule did not cover financial costs, said the statement from parent company and aerospace giant EADS.
6400	8621	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"The extent of the additional costs will be influenced by the actual production and delivery scenario," it said.
6401	8622	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be discussing the new schedule with its customers in the coming months, the statement added.
6402	8624	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"Beyond these aircraft, the changes in production schedules will potentially have some impact, the details of which we will need to understand from Airbus," an SIA spokesman said.
6403	8625	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA has ordered 19 A380 aircraft in all and took delivery of the first in October, some 18 months late after earlier technical problems held up production and led to a dramatic restructuring and cost-cutting programme at Airbus.
6404	8626	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"We have seen the announcement from Airbus and are now waiting to hear from them in detail about what the changes to their production schedule mean for deliveries of our aircraft down the line," SIA said.
6405	8627	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA launched the first commercial A380 flight from Singapore to Sydney in October, followed by services to London.
6406	8628	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A380 flights to Tokyo are to begin on May 20.

6411	8634	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The rubbish crisis in the Naples area deepened Thursday as two treatment centres complained of paralysis and local authorities announced the upcoming closure of a major dump, an official said.
6412	8635	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Outside the Caivano treatment centre some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the southern city, about 100 trucks were seen waiting to unload their rubbish.
6413	8636	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Another centre that converts rubbish into fuel, located at nearby Giugliano, "is also functioning at a snail's pace", Ilaria Proietti told AFP.
6414	8637	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	She added that one of the area's two main dumps, in Villaricca north of Naples, would close on Saturday because it had reached saturation point.
6415	8638	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The two-week-old crisis has seen some 15,000 tonnes of waste accumulate along roads in the southern province, including nearly 3,000 tonnes in Naples itself, because of a logjam at overstretched treatment and recycling centres, Proietti said Wednesday.
6416	8640	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	New figures were not available Thursday.
6417	8641	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Provincial authorities have sent text messages to Naples area residents asking them not to burn their waste in a bid to avoid the spread of toxic substances such as dioxin.
6418	8642	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The chronic problem is the result of a lack of space in existing dumps, some of which have been closed by court injunctions after their operations were taken over by organised crime, dubbed the "ecomafia".
6419	8643	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	A May 10 decree by the centre-left government creating four new dumps -- fiercely opposed by people living nearby -- will not come into effect for several weeks.

6424	8652	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 2007-08-21 17:10:33 UTC
6425	8653	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a hurricane.
6426	8654	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The space shuttle swooped out of the partly cloudy sky and touched down on the runway at 12:32 p.m. (1632 GMT).
6427	8655	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	"Congratulations.
6428	8656	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Welcome home.
6429	8657	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	You've given a new meaning to higher education," Mission Control told commander Scott Kelly and his crew, which included teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan.
6430	8658	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The main concern for much of the mission was the gouge to Endeavour's protective tiles.
6431	8659	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA did not want the shuttle to suffer any structural damage that, while not catastrophic, might require lengthy postflight repairs.
6432	8660	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Over the past few days and right up until landing, NASA had stressed that the 3 1/2-inch-long 3.5 (8.9-centimeter-long) gouge in Endeavour's belly would not endanger the shuttle during its landing.
6433	8661	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a damaged wing on shuttle Columbia had allowed hot gases to seep in during the re-entry, tearing the shuttle apart.
6434	8662	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	There was zero chance of a Columbia-style catastrophe this time, NASA managers insisted, although they acknowledged re-entry was always risky.
6435	8663	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that the spacecraft would hold up.
6436	8664	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	With its pilots reporting no problems, Endeavour zoomed over the South Pacific, crossed Central America and Cuba, then headed up the Florida peninsula into Kennedy Space Center.
6437	8665	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Its trip spanned 13 days and 5.3 million miles (8.53 million kilometers).
6438	8666	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station visit short because of Hurricane Dean.
6439	8667	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	At the time, NASA was uncertain if Dean would veer toward Texas and threaten Houston, home to Mission Control.
6440	8668	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Even though forecasters later put Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.
6441	8669	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	During Endeavour's liftoff on Aug. 8, a piece of foam insulation or ice had broken off a bracket on the external fuel tank, fell onto a strut lower on the tank and then bounced into the shuttle, gashing its tiles.
6442	8670	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The astronauts inspected the especially vulnerable areas Sunday, after undocking from the international space station.
6443	8671	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA on Monday cleared Endeavour for landing after engineers finished evaluating the latest laser images of the shuttle's wings and nose and concluded there were no holes or cracks from micrometeorites or space junk.
6444	8672	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Brackets have shed debris in launches since Columbia, but it was not until Endeavour's flight that such debris caused noticeable damage again.
6445	8673	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damage triggered a weeklong analyses that involved hundreds of engineers and thousands of hours of supercomputer simulations.
6446	8674	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the problem is solved.
6447	8675	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	For now, Discovery is supposed to lift off in late October.
6448	8676	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	While in orbit, the astronauts attached a new truss segment to the space station and replaced a failed gyroscope needed for keeping the outpost headed in the right direction.
6449	8677	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	They also delivered 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms) of supplies.
6450	8678	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The crew completed four spacewalks, two of which were cut short.
6451	8679	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	One was halted after a spacewalking astronaut noticed a cut in his glove.
6452	8680	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The other was abbreviated to give the crew enough time to prepare for an early departure from the space station.

6459	8688	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	China's more than 100 million migrant workers do not have a single representative in the nation's parliament, but that may soon change, state media said Thursday.

6461	8692	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	There are different figures for the exact number of migrant workers in China.
6462	8693	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Xinhua gave a number Thursday of about 200 million migrant workers, of which more than 120 million work in cities and the remainder work in towns.
6463	8694	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Another 13 million farmers will become migrant workers annually in the coming years, it said.
6464	8695	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Millions of migrant labourers fuelling China's economic boom are forming an urban underclass deprived of rights and victims of widespread abuse, human rights group Amnesty International said in a report published in early March.

6467	8700	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Six decades after World War II, about 240,000 survivors live in Israel and many say that instead of spending their final years in dignity, they lack money for medicines, psychological treatment and in some cases even for food.
6468	8701	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Josef Charney was 17 when a cargo train carried him from the Warsaw ghetto to the Treblinka death camp, the yellow star on his chest marking him as a Jew targeted for eradication by the Nazis.
6469	8703	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Charney was among at least 500 survivors and supporters who rallied outside the parliament building, carrying placards and wearing stickers reading "The Holocaust is still here" and "Forgive us for surviving."
6470	8704	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"I want (the government) to let them die with peace and dignity," Charney said, adding that he was marching for survivors not well enough to come themselves.
6471	8705	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"The government of Israel has not recognized us.
6472	8706	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	We don't belong to them."
6473	8707	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II, and hundreds of thousands who survived concentration camps came to Israel after the war.
6474	8708	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Many suffered physical or psychological damage from the torture and deprivation they suffered at the hands of the Nazis.
6475	8710	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	That works out to just 83 shekels -- or $20 -- a month for each survivor, a sum critics deemed woefully inadequate.
6476	8711	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We don't think that 83 shekels a month is enough" said Gal Rotem of the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund, which helped organize the march.
6477	8712	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"You can't buy food or drugs or anything else with 83 shekels."
6478	8713	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	By definition an elderly group, many of whom are unwell, an average of 35 of the survivors die each day, she added.

6480	8716	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Sunday's protesters, however, doubted the government would act quickly.
6481	8717	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"Until they say what the solution is, we won't believe anything else," Rotem said.
6482	8718	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"It's not a good feeling that Holocaust survivors have to walk and march to say to Olmert that they are still alive and need help."
6483	8719	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Others expressed sadness that Israeli has not helped survivors more.

6488	8724	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"But thinking about how other survivors live...my heart just hurts."
6489	8725	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We can't imagine what they went through," added her daughter, Yardit Ishai.
6490	8726	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"I can't stand the thought that someone who was hungry, that someone who was almost killed, is hungry today."

6600	8884	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	An electricity failure at the facility on July 25, 2006, led to the immediate shutdown of Forsmark 1 after two of four backup generators, which supply power to the reactor's cooling system, malfunctioned for about 20 minutes.

6621	8915	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"The vendors have a right to work, but they should be given the opportunity to do something more creative," said Janette Rodriguez while passing out copies of La Mancha, a leftist newspaper.
6622	8916	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
6623	8918	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
6624	8921	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching transformation, though, after migration surged from other regions.
6625	8922	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
6626	8923	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
6627	8924	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle with each other outside."
6628	8925	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
6629	8926	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Critics of the municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic because it took place only after the president won re-election in December.
6630	8929	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
6631	8930	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	An earlier effort would have been difficult.
6632	8931	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
6633	8932	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
6634	8933	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors say promises of government loans have gone unmet.
6635	8934	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
6636	8935	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."
6637	8936	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's revolution.
6638	8937	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedro Aponte, 72, a retired fruit seller, relied on nostalgia to discuss the boulevard's potential.
6639	8938	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We have to conserve this place," said Aponte he set up chess sets a recent morning under an awning, where a growing crowd gathers each day to play.
6640	8939	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Officials even organized a small Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.
6641	8940	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls," Aponte reminisced.
6642	8941	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They would smile," he said.
6643	8942	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"That was beautiful."

6645	8946	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	In the 27-nation European Union, the commission forecast inflation would reach 3.6 percent this year, instead of the 2.9 percent previously expected, but stuck to its estimate for 2.0 percent economic growth.
6646	8947	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	"Economic growth is moderating in the EU and euro area and the current, imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
6647	8948	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The commission predicted that consumer prices growth would peak in the second quarter and cool down over the remainder of the year and into 2009, bringing inflation in the eurozone down to 2.2 percent next year.
6648	8949	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Driven ever higher by record commodities prices, 12-month eurozone inflation hit 3.6 percent in March, the highest since the 1999 launch of the shared currency and well above the European Central Bank's comfort level of just under 2.0 percent.
6649	8950	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While oil prices flirt with records close to 120 dollars a barrel, the EU executive said futures contracts suggested food prices would rise 54 percent in the first half of 2008 before stabilising.
6650	8951	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, not all was doom and gloom in the commission's report with regional economic powerhouse Germany expected to perform better than the last time Brussels made forecasts in February.
6651	8952	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Europe's biggest economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent this year, rather than the 1.6 percent the commission predicted in February.
6652	8954	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead to 2009, the commission predicted that economic activity would pick up towards the end of the year to about 2.0 percent in the eurozone at an annualised rate.
6653	8955	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, for the whole of 2009, it forecast eurozone growth would slow to 1.5 percent while activity in the overall EU economy would ease to 1.8 percent.

6655	8957	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's military rulers Sunday threatened to take "effective action" against pro-democracy supporters who have staged a rare string of anti-junta protests across the country over the last three weeks.
6656	8958	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The secretive regime took the unusual step of issuing a statement directly to the news media, accusing the National League for Democracy (NLD) of trying to instigate nationwide unrest.
6657	8959	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"They agitated through various means to instigate riots and unrest among the people.
6658	8960	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The NLD conspired to create this situation to derail the national political process," it said.
6659	8962	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The monks also held about 20 government officials hostage for several hours on Thursday, in the most dramatic standoff with the regime since the protests broke out on August 19.
6660	8963	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"Under these circumstances, the government will never tolerate such malicious acts and will take effective action against those committing such acts in accordance with the existing law," the statement said.
6661	8964	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Normally such statements would be filtered through official media, sometimes several days later, but the three-page document dated Saturday was given directly to journalists on Sunday and reported immediately in the state press.
6662	8965	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have been arrested over the protests, which were sparked by a massive hike in fuel prices last month.
6663	8966	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government again defended the price hike in the statement Sunday, saying it was necessary because of high world oil prices that had made fuel subsidies unaffordable.

6665	8969	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	PORTLAND, Oregon 2007-06-13 21:06:33 UTC
6666	8970	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Justin Wilson admits he's going to have to pay a bit more attention now that Champ Car has adopted the standing start.
6667	8971	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I saw the lights go out and I thought, 'I'm meant to do something now,'" he joked after the inaugural race to use the start.
6668	8972	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I have to work on my reactions."
6669	8974	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts -- the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead stop on a grid.
6670	8975	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	When the last of a bank of lights above the track goes out, the drivers take off.
6671	8976	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Once all the red lights go out, you drop your clutch and go, and that's the start," said Wilson, who had the pole for the race.
6672	8977	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's quite a buildup in tension because you have a few moments where it's very quiet and nothing's happening and then all of the sudden everyone's on full throttle and they drop their clutch."
6673	8978	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car had wanted to use standing starts at the beginning of the season, but it was delayed for further testing until the Grand Prix of Portland, the fourth race of the season.
6674	8979	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The move toward standing starts got a mixed reaction from drivers.
6675	8980	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Points leader and three-time defending series champion Sebastien Bourdais was especially vocal with concerns that drivers could stall at the start, setting up rear-end accidents all over the grid.
6676	8981	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total disaster," he said.
6677	8982	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Many drivers already had experience with the procedure.
6678	8983	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The Champ Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for the most part.
6679	8984	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because there's so much more power," Rahal said.
6680	8985	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to put the power down on these cars as it is.
6681	8986	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	In third gear coming out of a corner it can be hard to do.
6682	8987	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	So doing it from a stop is a tough thing, especially when it is wet."
6683	8988	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Fellow rookie Robert Doornbos brought in perspective from two seasons with Formula One.
6684	8989	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains Doornbos.
6685	8990	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Here it is all driver.
6686	8991	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	If you mess up, you stall and have a big problem.
6687	8992	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I did three or four and it went quite well.
6688	8993	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
6689	8994	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to the rolling start.
6690	8995	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled, which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland.
6691	8996	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean it's never going to happen.
6692	8997	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It means I was a little more pessimistic than the truth.
6693	8998	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Definitely put on a good show."
6694	8999	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Cleveland will be the next chance for fans to see the standing start, which Champ Car is expected to use the remainder of the season.
6695	9000	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But many drivers say they'd like the series to keep rolling starts in the mix, too.
6696	9001	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm not sure which I prefer.
6697	9002	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I like doing them both," Wilson said.
6698	9003	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season.
6699	9004	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I think that's the best way.
6700	9005	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	To master both skills is the best thing for the drivers."

6725	9044	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"Sicko" filmmaker Michael Moore called a truce Monday in his weeklong fight with CNN that flared when the network accused him of misstating facts in his popular documentary about the health- care system.
6726	9045	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore had promised the network over the weekend that "I'm about to become your worst nightmare," leading CNN to post on its Web site a remarkably lengthy response to his accusations.
6727	9046	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore noted in an interview Monday that CNN had admitted to two mistakes in its reporting on "Sicko" and that he is willing to move on.
6728	9048	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's a whole lot more to do with this other than I and others are going to be a lot more skeptical with what I see on CNN."
6729	9049	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN, in its statement, noted that it has given Moore multiple opportunities to discuss his concerns about the report on the air.
6730	9050	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic that someone who has made a career out of holding powerful interests accountable is so sensitive to having his own work held up to the light by impartial journalists, as we did in our examination of `Sicko,'" CNN said.
6731	9051	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Shortly before Moore appeared for an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, the network ran a report by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that had done some fact-checking on Moore's movie.
6732	9053	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Gupta addressed several statistics in "Sicko" before concluding: "No matter how much Moore fudged the facts -- and he did fudge some facts -- there is one thing everyone can agree on: the (health care) system here should be far better."
6733	9054	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In Gupta's report, CNN had said that Moore had reported that Cuba spends $25 (euro18) per person for health care.
6734	9056	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN blamed a transcription error for its mistake and apologized for it on and off the air.
6735	9057	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network accuses Moore of "cherry-picking" numbers from different academic studies to make his arguments stronger.
6736	9058	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN said it believes in essentially comparing apples with apples.
6737	9059	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he tried to use the most recent data available.
6738	9060	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore was also angry that Gupta interviewed Paul Keckley, who works for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, as a critic of "Sicko."

6745	9070	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network said it was comfortable letting viewers judge for themselves.

6749	9074	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
6750	9075	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The former board chairman of the Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being convicted on five counts of corruption, including bribery.
6751	9077	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	In addition to his convictions, Zhang was also stripped of political rights for life and all his personal property was confiscated.
6752	9078	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The five counts involved 50 million yuan, but there was no breakdown for each count.
6753	9080	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite Gao, who fled after sending the funds to Canada in 2005, and another suspect, Li Dongzhe.
6754	9083	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of misappropriating public funds.
6755	9084	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd, a publicly listed company, said two days later in a public announcement that 293 million yuan of its funds were missing from the BOC's Hesong Street Branch.
6756	9086	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's first trial commenced at the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City in September 2006.
6757	9088	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.

6760	9092	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"China is an important market, a new market and a growing one," said Rebecca Nabutola, permanent secretary at the ministry of tourism and wildlife.
6761	9095	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"We're not going to China in an attempt to rebuild our image... it was never really dented and tourist behaviour was not really affected," said Nabutola, part of a delegation heading to China next week to boost tourism.
6762	9096	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	Tourism is the top foreign currency earning sector in Kenya and suffered from the worldwide attention attracted by the electoral dispute and ensuing cycle of tribal violence and revenge killings.
6763	9097	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With a fast-growing middle-class, China -- the world's most populated country and its fourth largest economy -- is a coveted market for all top tourist destinations.
6764	9098	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"There's also a lot of potential and a lot of interest that has come from India," the ministry official said.
6765	9099	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With cancellations from overseas tourists hitting around 90 percent in January, the ministry has launched a recovery programme which will also involve the development of domestic tourism.
6766	9100	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"If we want a sustainable tourism sector, we need a solid domestic base," Nabutola said.
6767	9101	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	The domestic market currently accounts for only 25 percent of the sector's revenue, a figure she said Kenya hoped to double.

6777	9119	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
6778	9120	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., is not a large man, standing perhaps 5 feet 3 inches tall in thick soles.
6779	9121	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But he packed a whole lot of chutzpah when he walked into the House TV gallery Wednesday to demand that the new Democratic majority give the new Republican minority all the rights that Republicans had denied Democrats for years.
6780	9123	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're submitting this minority bill of rights, which will ensure that all sides are protected, that fairness and openness is in fact granted by the new majority.''
6781	9124	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Omitted from the McHenry plea for fairness was the fact that the GOP had ignored Pelosi's 2004 request -- while routinely engaging in the procedural maneuvers that Pelosi's plan would have corrected.
6782	9125	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Was the gentleman from North Carolina asking Democrats to do as he says, not as he did?
6783	9126	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Look, I'm a junior member,'' young McHenry protested.
6784	9127	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not beholden to what former congresses did.''
6785	9128	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Anne Kornblut of the New York Times asked McHenry if his complaint might come across as whining.
6786	9129	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not whining,'' he whined.
6787	9130	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the Democrats' heavy-handed leadership.
6788	9131	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But Republicans expecting Democrats to rule the House with an iron fist are likely to be pleasantly surprised: The incoming majority was having enough trouble keeping its own supporters in line.
6789	9133	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Just after Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., vowed, ``We're gonna cut the interest rate in half for student loans,'' hecklers began to chant ``De-escalate!
6790	9134	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Investigate!
6791	9135	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Troops home now!''
6792	9136	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``That is exactly what we're talking about,'' Emanuel said, trying to appease the protesters.
6793	9137	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But the hecklers kept chanting, and he fled.
6794	9138	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The Democratic leaders in retreat, Sheehan seized the microphone.
6795	9139	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We put them back in power,'' she said of the Democrats.
6796	9141	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	And they're not requests -- they're demands.''
6797	9142	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	If Wednesday was any indication, the 110th Congress will be highly entertaining, if not terribly productive.
6798	9143	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	So far, it's hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
6799	9145	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	At 32, he is a year older than McHenry, and several inches taller, but no less outraged by Democrats' refusal to bestow on Republicans the rights that Republicans refused to bestow on Democrats.
6800	9146	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was covered with a layer of makeup.
6801	9147	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're clearly disappointed,'' seconded Roy Blunt of Missouri.
6802	9148	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm disappointed, as are some others,'' added Kay Granger of Texas.
6803	9149	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
6804	9150	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It fell to CNN's Dana Bash to point out the awkward truth.
6805	9151	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``You can play back, almost verbatim, Democrats ... saying almost exactly what you all just said,'' she said.
6806	9152	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``So is there a little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority rights?''
6807	9153	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
6808	9154	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were still in the majority?''
6809	9155	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	inquired Rick Klein of the Boston Globe.
6810	9157	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Republicans must have known they'd have some explaining to do, because they scheduled back-to-back news conferences on their minority rights.
6811	9158	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	As soon as the Putnam session ended, Granger took the elevator up three flights and joined McHenry and his cohort in the TV gallery.
6812	9159	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Granger had not updated her talking points.
6813	9160	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``It's very disappointing,'' she said.
6814	9161	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights.
6815	9162	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	McHenry unfurled excuses: ``We were not in Congress.
6816	9163	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... I didn't have the opportunity.
6817	9164	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... She did not put it in legislative form.''
6818	9165	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It had all the makings of a PR debacle.
6819	9166	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Fortunately for McHenry, the Democrats were otherwise engaged.
6820	9167	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	An hour after fleeing the microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about ethics and the minimum wage.
6821	9168	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Rahm, would you answer Cindy Sheehan, though?''
6822	9169	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``An hour or so ago you had to stop your remarks because (of) Cindy Sheehan.''
6823	9170	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What are Democrats going to do about the war in Iraq?''
6824	9171	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.

6830	9181	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	Temperatures of over 100 degrees (38 C) that have gripped the Memphis area for days have been linked to two more deaths, raising the toll to five, officials said Tuesday.
6831	9182	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	The deaths come as searing temperatures were recorded in the south-central portion of the U.S., with South Carolina and Missouri each reporting one heat-related death and Illinois blaming three deaths on the heat since Thursday.
6832	9183	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	The temperature in Memphis rose to at least 100 degrees (38 C) again Tuesday, the fifth consecutive day of triple-digit fahrenheit highs.
6833	9184	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	Last year, there were two heat-related deaths in the area over the summer, said Shelby County Medical Examiner Karen E. Chancellor.
6834	9185	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	The latest two deaths were a 75-year-old man found in a home with no air conditioning and a 77-year-old woman found in her back yard where she apparently had been gardening, Chancellor said.
6835	9186	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	Both were found Monday.

6844	9201	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Two FedEx jets got too close to each other on takeoff from the Memphis airport last week because of confusion over flight numbers for the planes, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said.
6845	9202	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident, which the FAA classified as serious, air traffic control error, remained under investigation.
6846	9203	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The air traffic controllers union blamed the incident and other recent mistakes by controllers at Memphis on short staffing and forced overtime.
6847	9205	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"We have never found fatigue to be an issue in any of the errors that have occurred at Memphis," Bergen said.
6848	9206	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	On Feb. 21, two FedEx jets flying in the same direction on takeoff came within 200 feet (60 meters) vertically and three- fourths of a mile (1.2 kilometers) horizontally to each other, Bergen said.
6849	9207	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Big jets in the Memphis area are supposed to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) vertically and 3 miles (5 kilometers) horizontally.
6850	9209	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
6851	9210	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident began with the pilot of one plane getting on the wrong radio frequency "and accepting instructions intended for another aircraft," Bergen said.
6852	9211	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.
6853	9212	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"The controller didn't recognize the error on read-back," Bergen said.
6854	9213	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.
6855	9215	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FedEx declined comment, noting the investigation was ongoing.

6858	9218	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The explosion went off in the southern K4 neighbourhood as dozens of women supported by local NGOs gathered to sweep the area, leaving scenes of carnage in the street.

7006	9432	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"The relief work [so far] is successful," said Wen, on his fourth visit to Sichuan since the quake.
7007	9433	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"Now we are entering a critical stage to boost rehabilitation."
7008	9434	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	With a combination of temporary housing and repaired buildings, about 4.45 million homeless families in the province have found accommodation.
7009	9435	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen visited Zaoshu Village, Qingchuan County, one of the worst- hit areas, as the villagers were busy building or repairing houses.
7010	9436	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	A couple, Shi Guangwu and Zhang Zhengfang, told him that they received a subsidy of 23,000 yuan (3,333 U.S. dollars) from the government to build a new residence.
7011	9437	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Under a provincial government policy issued in June, rural families who lost their homes will build new ones under government supervision.
7012	9438	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Each will receive about 20,000 yuan from the government.
7013	9439	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"I am glad to see farmers in the quake area are busy rebuilding their homes with their own hands.
7014	9440	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	As long as we carefully plan and organize the work, new houses will rise soon," said Wen, who expressed appreciation for their self-reliant attitude.
7015	9441	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	During the four-day trip beginning Sunday, Wen also visited an urban community in Qiaozhuang Town, Qingchuan.
7016	9442	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Permanent home rebuilding has not started in the urban area yet as the government is working on a subsidy policy for urban survivors.
7017	9443	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He explained to the residents that work has to be done to evaluate the condition of damaged houses and develop a rehabilitation plan.
7018	9444	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"As soon as a policy is formulated, rebuilding will start," he said.
7019	9445	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Besides residential buildings, schools and hospitals are priorities in rehabilitation.
7020	9446	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At a temporary hospital in Qingchuan, Wen promised patients that the new hospital would be built soon and medical facilities would be better than before the earthquake.
7021	9447	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The Premier chatted with doctors and nurses from eastern Zhejiang Province who were there helping to serve local residents.
7022	9448	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen thanked them for lending a hand to quake survivors.
7023	9450	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen returned to the school, which is in makeshift buildings, during this visit.
7024	9451	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	More than 240 students in the school were killed in the quake.
7025	9452	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Standing in a classroom before the blackboard, he said to the students: "You are our country's future.
7026	9453	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	I believe beautiful flowers will blossom over the debris of the earthquake."
7027	9454	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Children presented handmade cards to Wen and invited him to take photos with them.
7028	9455	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The Premier presented flowers and bowed three times under the national flag on the campus to mark the victims.
7029	9456	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Agriculture and industry were gradually recovering in the quake area.
7030	9457	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At Yongquan Village in Deyang City, people were harvesting rice and planting potatoes.
7031	9458	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen went into the field, asking farmers about their crop yield.
7032	9459	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Told there was a bumper rice harvest despite the quake, he urged local officials to resume production as soon as possible where conditions allow.
7033	9460	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At quake-devastated Dongfang Steam Turbine Co., Ltd. of Deyang, which Wen had visited twice previously, he was visibly happy to see production back at the pre-quake level.
7034	9461	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He urged employees to continue working to build the company into a more advanced, secure and sustainable organization.
7035	9462	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The premier also visited a road repair site near the epicenter, Yingxiu, praising the soldiers and workers who braved aftershocks and landslides to keep the road clear after the quake.
7036	9463	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The worst-hit Beichuan County must be relocated as it was severely damaged in the quake and the original site might be vulnerable.
7037	9464	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen again visited the debris where the county seat was once located.
7038	9465	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He trudged on foot for an hour through the debris with a heavy heart.
7039	9466	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He laid a wreath at a mass burial site of quake victims and observed a one- minute silent mourning period together with his entourage.
7040	9467	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told survivor Wang Dan, a 26-year-old woman of Qiang ethnic group, that the pain was overwhelming but the Beichuan people were strong.
7041	9468	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"Although half of the population perished, the other half -- the survivors -- will build a new Beichuan with hope," he said.
7042	9469	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	When invited by Wang to come again when the new Beichuan is built, Wen promised he would come to the place, which he would remember for life.
7043	9470	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told local officials that the county should be rebuilt not only materially but also spiritually, as its unique Qiang culture should be preserved and promoted.
7044	9471	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Presiding over a meeting attended by Sichuan provincial-level officials on Tuesday night, Wen said the quake rescue and relief work had entered an important phase of reconstruction.
7045	9472	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He urged local governments to seriously implement the reconstruction plan approved by the State Council, the country's Cabinet, and lead local people to accomplish the major tasks of rehabilitation and reconstruction in three years.

7047	9474	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
7048	9475	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the manufacturer of a federally approved medical device cannot be sued under state law if the device causes an injury.
7049	9476	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	By 8-1, the court ruled in favor of Medtronic, the Minneapolis-based maker of a balloon catheter that burst and severely injured Charles R. Riegel while he was undergoing an angioplasty in 1996.
7050	9477	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Riegel and his wife, Donna, sued the company in federal court, contending that the catheter had been designed, labeled and manufactured in a way that violated state law, and that those defects had caused severe and permanent injuries to Riegel.
7051	9478	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But a federal district court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, dismissed the Riegels' suit on the ground that the catheter had been given pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration, thus protecting the manufacturer from liability under state law.
7052	9479	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal courts on Wednesday, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority that Medtronic and other manufacturers were protected under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre- emption bars states from imposing on medical devices "any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter."
7053	9480	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But the justices' ruling was hardly the last word on when FDA approval bars patients from suing.
7054	9481	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	They are already considering at least three cases involving drugs and drug-labeling.
7055	9482	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Scalia wrote that the FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each device application and grants pre-market approval only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of its "safety and effectiveness."
7056	9483	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives," Scalia wrote, noting that the FDA approved a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts "even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent."
7057	9485	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Arguing that "nothing is perfectly safe," Olson argued that it would harm patients and future patients to "discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives."
7058	9486	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Medtronic, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cardiovascular devices, no longer makes the type of catheter used on Riegel, who died several years after the operation.
7059	9487	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter on Wednesday, asserting that the majority had adopted an unnecessary "constriction of state authority."
7060	9488	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Ginsburg said she did not believe that Congress had intended to bring about "a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices."
7061	9489	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	In this case, the Bush administration had taken the side of the medical-device industry, arguing argued that there would be "serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits" if juries could second-guess the agency.
7062	9491	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"Pretty bad for patients, pretty good for industry profits," she said.

7069	9500	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
7070	9501	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	America's growing love affair with energy-efficient cars is starting to take a toll on the nation's crumbling highways and roads.
7071	9502	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Requiring fewer fill-ups at the pumps, the vehicles are putting a pinch on the federal Highway Trust Fund -- the major government funding source for highway and mass-transit projects.
7072	9503	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
7073	9504	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	To be fair, federal officials say, it's not just energy-efficient autos that are sucking the fund dry.
7074	9505	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
7075	9506	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for each gallon of gas.
7076	9507	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
7077	9508	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"This total dependence on gas tax isn't working anymore."
7078	9509	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters also chairs the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that is reviewing the situation and will make recommendations to Congress in a report this year.
7079	9511	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
7080	9512	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
7081	9513	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
7082	9514	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
7083	9515	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.
7084	9516	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in Atlanta.
7085	9517	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Las Vegas is next, and the commission will conclude its hearings after visiting Minneapolis and Chicago in April.
7086	9518	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	After the commission files its report, legislators could decide to adopt its recommendations or use them as a guide for funding federal projects, said Chris Bonanti, special assistant to the administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration and staff liaison to the commission.
7087	9520	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Roads are still congested.
7088	9521	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Traffic is getting worse.
7089	9522	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"What we're spending isn't really getting the results we want," he said.
7090	9523	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
7091	9524	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
7092	9525	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund surfaced in 2005.
7093	9526	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
7094	9529	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
7095	9530	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Taylor acknowledged that over the years, automotive technology has made all cars and trucks more fuel-efficient and contributed to fewer trips to the pump.
7096	9531	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
7097	9533	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
7098	9534	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
7099	9536	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
7100	9537	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
7101	9538	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.

7103	9541	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.
7104	9542	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nobody wants to pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what they're currently paying."
7105	9543	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	1st Ld: Official worries over possible plague at Sichuan quake epicenter
7106	9544	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	YINGXIU TOWN, Sichuan, May 15 (Xinhua)
7107	9545	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Plague could break out in quake-hit areas if victims' bodies were not buried soon, a local official told Xinhua on Thursday.
7108	9547	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Since the destructive earthquake on Monday, Bai has been searching for survivors with a rescue team in Yingxiu of Wenchuan County, epicenter of the quake.
7109	9548	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	High temperatures would quicken the rotting of bodies, and plague would break out, he warned.
7110	9549	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Some bodies are put together on the ground in the town, and there is already bad smell in the air.
7111	9550	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We are in urgent need of body bags," Bai said, adding there is an urgent need for food and water.
7112	9551	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"Air-dropped food and drinking water are limited and far from meeting the demand," he said.
7113	9552	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said some survivors have fetched water from a mountain spring, but it is unclear if the water is safe for drinking.
7114	9554	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said the bodies of the dead would be handled properly as soon as possible to prevent harmful bacteria from growing.
7115	9555	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We should not add to the losses caused by natural disasters and let people suffer more just because we have not done our job well," said Gao.
7116	9557	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Large-sized rescue equipments, including heavy-lifting gear, excavators, and bulldozers, and large number of troops would be sent into the epicenter, an officer with the Chengdu Military Area said.
7117	9558	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	At 8:20 p.m., the air force also began to airdrop large-sized rescue equipments to Yingxiu.
7118	9559	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	The equipment would improve the efficiency of rescue missions carried out by the army, the military source said.
7119	9561	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	South, North clash over way forward for Chemical Weapons Convention
7120	9563	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Developed and developing countries on Monday voiced different opinions over the way forward for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) after 10 years of its entry into force.
7121	9564	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	At an annual conference of the CWC member states, developed countries called for rapid national implementation of the convention, while developing countries asked for access to technology and international cooperation in chemical industry.
7122	9565	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"It is fundamental to ensure the removal of and to prevent the imposition of any discriminatory restriction on access to materials, equipment and technology required by developing states parties for their continued and peaceful development," said a joint statement of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and China.
7123	9567	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	A European Union statement complained, however, about the slow pace of the implementation of Article VII of the CWC, which covers national implementation, including legislative and administrative measures.
7124	9569	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Washington also expressed concern over the fact that a small number of countries have not taken "meaningful steps" to meet their obligations under Article VII.
7125	9570	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	"Article VII requires all states to implement the convention fully, which typically requires an array of laws, regulations and procedures," said U.S. permanent representative to the OPCW, Eric Javits, in a statement.
7126	9571	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Consultations are under way for decisions on Article VII and Article XI at this year's conference, officials said.
7127	9572	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Developed and developing countries agreed on universality of the CWC membership.
7128	9573	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	They all urged those countries that have not joined the convention to do so without delay.
7129	9574	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	So far 182 countries have become member states of the CWC, leaving only 13 outside.
7130	9575	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The CWC is an international disarmament treaty which bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
7131	9576	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The OPCW, with its headquarters in The Hague, is mandated to oversee the implementation of the chemical weapons treaty.
7132	9577	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	In the past 10 years, a third of the world's declared stockpile of approximately 71,000 metric tons of chemical agent has been verifiably destroyed.
7133	9578	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Albania became the first country in the world which has completed destruction of chemical weapons stockpile.
7134	9579	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The annual conference is the decision-making body of the OPCW.
7135	9580	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Last year's conference decided to postpone the deadline for the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles until April 2012.
7136	9586	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Police said restaurant cook Thanassis Arvanitis severed the head of his 25-year-old girlfriend Sunday on the holiday island of Santorini.
7137	9587	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Arvanitis agreed to surrender to police officers, then attacked one officer with the cleaver and escaped in a patrol car, police said in a statement.
7138	9588	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	He was shot three times by police while trying to flee.
7139	9589	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Three female bystanders were also injured in the clash in Bourboulos, near the island's main town of Fira.
7140	9591	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Arvanitis and the three bystanders were being treated in a state hospital in Athens.
7141	9593	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The tourist was in stable condition.
7142	9594	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The injured policeman received treatment for facial wounds on Santorini.
7143	9595	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Following an argument, "the (suspect) slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman ... totally severing her head," a statement from the South Aegean Police Department said.
7144	9596	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	"The attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other."

7146	9599	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Supporters lower their expectations for Mich. primary with strategy to focus on later contests.
7147	9600	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	By Gordon Trowbridge
7148	9601	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Detroit News Washington Bureau
7149	9603	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Polls show the former New York mayor could finish fourth, or even lower, in today's New Hampshire primary, after a fifth-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.
7150	9606	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a finish would do nothing, she said, to change Giuliani's strategy, which relies on competing in larger states with more convention delegates at stake .
7151	9607	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	But many analysts question whether Giuliani can remain competitive in those large states without at least some hint of success in the early rounds.
7152	9608	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The last Detroit News-WXYZ Action News poll of Republican voters, in mid-December, showed Giuliani in third place at 12 percent, down 16 points from a month earlier.
7153	9609	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"History says he needs some success before Florida to be successful in Florida," said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which has surveyed Florida voters throughout the year.
7154	9610	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The danger, Brown said, is that the lead Giuliani held in Florida and other large states throughout the summer and fall may disappear .
7155	9611	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's camp has fought against such perceptions for months
7156	9613	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Of course, no such sweep has developed.
7157	9614	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa winner Mike Huckabee is an also-ran in New Hampshire, where Romney and McCain are battling in a close race.
7158	9615	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	After Michigan comes South Carolina's Jan. 19 primary, in which Huckabee, McCain, Romney and Fred Thompson all have gotten significant support in recent polls.
7159	9616	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a fractured field is all Giuliani could have hoped for, said Miller.
7160	9617	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"We talked about this strategy very early on: Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," she said.
7161	9618	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"It makes some people nervous, but we've talked about it for months: The thing to do is to win delegates."
7162	9619	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The math is compelling.
7163	9620	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire today will award 21 delegates to this summer's national convention
7164	9621	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa technically awarded none at all.
7165	9622	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Florida will award 114, which the Feb. 5 states combine for roughly half the overall total.
7166	9624	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The winner in each of the state's 15 congressional districts receives three delegates, with 15 more going to the statewide winner.

7168	9628	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the North Koreans left with any illusions about the fact that the ball is in their court, and that everybody believes that they have got to respond and respond positively on verification," Rice told reporters.
7169	9631	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Begun in 2003 before lapsing for three years, the six-country disarmament negotiations resumed after North Korea staged its first nuclear test in 2006, finally producing a landmark denuclearisation agreement in February 2007.
7170	9632	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The negotiations then hit a deadlock at the end of last year when North Korea failed to meet a deadline to fully disable its weapons-grade plutonium plants and deliver a full accounting of its nuclear activities, including a suspected uranium enrichment program.
7171	9633	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The deadlock was broken last month when North Korea handed over a partial accounting or "declaration" of its plutonium-related programmes that must now be completely dismantled and the whole process verified.
7172	9635	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Rice said that required a minimum of 45 days notification, the same period Washington has given North Korea to agree on the verification protocol.
7173	9636	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I think it should be very well understood that unless we're satisfied that we can verify the declaration, we have been very clear that we're taking that into our assessment of when to go forward," Rice said.
7174	9638	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	But she said there are "internationally recognised methods to verify the number of kilograms of plutonium made."
7175	9639	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The protocol will "have to have specific measures, it will have to have means for access, and it will also have to have means to continue this process as new information becomes available," Rice said.
7176	9640	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"This will be a strong protocol.
7177	9641	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	All the parties yesterday talked about a rigorous protocol, talked about one that is to international standards."
7178	9646	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, 80, has held the seat since 1979, when the dashing former U.S. Navy secretary campaigned alongside his wife at the time, Elizabeth Taylor.
7179	9647	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner is leaving what would have been a safe seat for the Republicans if he had chosen to run again.
7180	9648	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His departure gives Democrats a better chance to protect or even expand their one- seat majority in the U.S. Senate.
7181	9650	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	After returning from the Iraq last week, Warner suggested that some troops should leave by the end of the year.
7182	9651	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His remarks roiled the White House, and Bush administration officials asked him to clarify that he had not broken politically with the president.
7183	9652	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner stood by his comments.
7184	9655	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	The Republican Party nominated Warner for the Senate in 1978 and Warner was elected by the razor-thin margin of 4,721 votes out of 1.2 million cast.
7185	9656	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	He was easily re-elected in 1984 and 1990.
7186	9657	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"Public service is a privilege and I urge all to try to find time some time in their lifetime to serve the needs of others," Warner said Friday.
7187	9658	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"I have tried to be not only true to myself, but true to the people of this great commonwealth I've served for 29 years now."

7190	9669	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We need to study if people should get access to handguns so freely," Vanhanen told reporters in Kauhajoki, 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Helsinki.
7191	9670	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"I'm very, very critical about the guns and during next few months we will make a decision about it."
7192	9671	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Finland has deeply held hunting traditions and ranks -- along with the United States -- in the top five nations in the world when it comes to civilian gun ownership.
7193	9672	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The government also called Wednesday for an investigation into police handling of the case.
7194	9673	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Police had questioned shooter Matti Saari, a student at the school, a day before the attack about YouTube clips showing him firing a handgun.
7195	9674	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We will obviously investigate what the foundation was for the decision to let him keep his weapon," Vanhanen said.
7196	9675	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	An anonymous tip Friday led police to search for Saari, but they released him after questioning Monday because police said they found no reason to keep him in custody.
7197	9676	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Some of the YouTube clips appeared to have been shot by another person and police said they would question Saari's acquaintances to find out who that was.
7198	9677	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	However, police said there was no indication that Saari had an accomplice during the shooting.
7199	9678	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Solemnly leading his nation in a day of mourning, Vanhanen and other ministers visited Kauhajoki, a town of 14,000 people, as flags flew at half-staff.
7200	9679	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Grieving residents placed candles and flowers outside the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality.
7201	9680	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The National Bureau of Investigation said all the female victims were students, while the two men who were killed were a teacher and a student.
7202	9681	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Saari also shot another female student in the head before shooting himself in the head.
7203	9682	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	That 21-year-old woman had two operations overnight but doctors said she was in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
7204	9683	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Investigators said most of the victims were from the Kauhajoki area, like Saari, meaning he probably knew them.
7205	9685	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"He left at home a message saying he wanted to murder as many people as possible.
7206	9686	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	He tried to shoot fatal shots."
7207	9688	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"With this weapon and plenty of ammunition, he came into the school yesterday morning and he also had a largish bag which apparently had flammable liquids or something to start fires," Lintula said.
7208	9689	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said panic erupted at the school, which offers courses in catering, tourism, nursing and home economics, as the masked gunman entered just before 11 a.m. and started firing in a classroom where students were taking an exam.
7209	9690	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	A video clip posted on the Internet by the alleged gunman showed him pointing his gun to the camera and saying "You will die next" before firing four rounds.
7210	9691	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The rampage bore eerie similarities to another school massacre in Finland last year in which an 18-year-old gunman killed eight people and himself.
7211	9692	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	After that massacre, the government promised to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 15 to 18, but legislation was never passed.
7212	9693	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	That change would not have stopped either of the recent school shooters, who were 18 and 22 years old.

7248	9740	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	With television cameras carefully positioned along his route, Medvedev listened earnestly and interjected with questions as he toured a development of starter apartments being built for young families, complete with playgrounds and sports facilities.
7249	9741	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Moscow insists the elections will be fair.
7250	9742	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	But critics charge that the opposition has been marginalised by biased media coverage and the use of state resources to promote the Kremlin's candidate.
7251	9743	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	A few strains showed through on Wednesday's tour, as when two workmen admitted to nervousness while "painting" and "repainting" a ceiling.
7252	9744	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	In fact their brushes were completely dry -- to avoid splashing the guests, they explained.
7253	9745	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	"How's the work going?"
7254	9746	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	asked the dark-suited Medvedev, lightening up somewhat.
7255	9747	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	"Are you being paid correctly?
7256	9748	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	.... So.
7257	9749	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Everything's alright."
7258	9750	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Moscow has been working for some time on ensuring a seamless transition after eight years under Putin, who is however expected to retain power in a job as prime minister.
7259	9751	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev currently holds the post of first deputy prime minister, in which he has been responsible for the touchstone issues of housing, health and education.
7260	9752	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Since Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last month, Medvedev's tours around the country to inspect such projects and meet residents have stepped up.
7261	9754	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev occasionally encounters complaints, such as when a building site worker told him of his worries about the cost of education and housing.
7262	9755	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev responded that the state would maintain the current number of subsidised higher education places and urged the young man to work hard.
7263	9756	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	At a meeting with regional governors he went on to emulate Putin's habit of reeling off statistics, taking copious notes, making cutting interjections and at one point rebuking an enthusiastic governor.
7264	9757	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Only on February 2, one month before voting, is the election campaign to be officially declared open.
7265	9758	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	At that point other candidates are due to be given a chance to appear in the media, with slots to broadcast what usually turn out to be stilted campaign advertisements.
7266	9759	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	But by then the whole thing may effectively be over.
7267	9760	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	At the end of December a poll by the independent Levada research centre suggested Medvedev was headed for 79 percent of the vote.

7269	9762	XIN_ENG_20070412.0108.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua)
7270	9763	XIN_ENG_20070412.0108.LDC2009T13	China on Thursday voiced deep concern over the latest situation in Kyrgyzstan, calling for international efforts to play a constructive role in maintaining stability in the country.
7271	9767	XIN_ENG_20070412.0108.LDC2009T13	Qin said the August summit is very important for the SCO development, noting the member states agreed to give full support to Kyrgyzstan, who is the present SCO's rotating chair, to well prepare for the summit.
7272	9768	XIN_ENG_20070412.0108.LDC2009T13	He said China sincerely hopes that Kyrgyzstan keep stability and develop its economy, and its people live a better life.
7273	9769	XIN_ENG_20070412.0108.LDC2009T13	This is in the fundamental interests of the people in and beyond Kyrgyzstan, Qin added.
7274	9770	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	World Bank leader urges action on mounting food prices
7275	9772	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	The president of the World Bank on Sunday urged immediate action to deal with rising food prices that have caused hunger and deadly violence in several countries.
7276	9773	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	Robert Zoellick said the international community has "to put our money where our mouth is" and act now to help hungry people.
7277	9774	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	"It is as stark as that."
7278	9775	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	He called on goverments to rapidly carry out commitments to provide the U.N. World Food Program with $500 million (euro315.8 million) in emergency aid it said it needs by May 1.
7279	9776	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	After a meeting of the bank's policy-setting committee, Zoellick said that the fall of the government in Haiti over the weekend after a wave of deadly rioting and looting over food prices underscores the importance of quick international action.
7280	9778	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	There have also been disturbances over food prices in Egypt and the Philippines.
7281	9780	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	WATERTON LAKES NATIONAL PARK, Alberta 2007-01-11 01:08:52 UTC
7282	9781	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	My dilemma: Should I trudge through shin-deep snow to the side door at the Kilmorey Lodge library?
7283	9782	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Or should I use the front door, shooing away the doe and her fawn that have taken shelter there from the falling snow?
7284	9783	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	I opt for the library door.
7285	9785	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This is their home
7286	9786	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	we are merely visitors.
7287	9788	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It also receives thousands of visitors who come north across the U.S. border as part of their visit to Glacier National Park, which abuts it.
7288	9789	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Together, they form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
7289	9790	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But in winter, Glacier is essentially shut down.
7290	9791	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Its hotels and restaurants are closed and boarded up, its high mountain roads buried by deep, drifting snow.
7291	9792	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The border crossing that is the summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until summer.
7292	9794	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The grocery store and the gas station are boarded up
7293	9795	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	so is the fudge shop, the espresso bar and the ice cream parlor.
7294	9796	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The summer population of more than 2,000 shrinks to perhaps 100, many of them park staff.
7295	9797	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And even many residents in nearby Montana assume Waterton has joined Glacier in winter slumber.
7296	9798	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make the offseason trek.
7297	9799	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We are here this weekend because the Kilmorey Lodge tops our list of places where we most want to be snowed in.
7298	9800	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Our cross-country skis are strapped on the car, and our snowshoes are in the trunk.
7299	9801	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We seek a blend of adventure and solitude, but also a comfortable bed, a warm fire, and gourmet meals served by cheerful and attentive staff.
7300	9802	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Kilmorey offers it all.
7301	9803	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Adventure isn't far away.
7302	9804	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton plows a road eight miles (13 kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the Rockies.
7303	9805	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	From there the remaining two miles (three kilometers) of unplowed road lead cross-country skiers or snowshoers to Cameron Lake, nestled in a cirque at 5,450 feet (1,660 meters) hard against the Continental Divide.
7304	9807	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers.
7305	9808	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And all around are forest and mountains, inviting explorers on snowshoes.
7306	9809	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Back down in the townsite is Cameron Falls, a spectacular waterfall on the edge of town that in winter is an easy destination for skiers who want an adventure a bit short of true wilderness.
7307	9810	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of trees near the Kilmorey.
7308	9811	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	A small herd of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep also frequents the townsite.
7309	9812	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Lucky visitors may even catch a glimpse of a mountain lion, searching for winter prey.
7310	9813	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating this time of year and pose no threat.
7311	9814	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895.
7312	9816	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others in Glacier park.
7313	9818	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It still overlooks the village of Waterton, and staying there is a highlight for many summer visitors.
7314	9819	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is closed in winter, and few even venture there because of the fierce and frigid winds that can howl down Upper Waterton Lake.
7315	9820	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Those that do visit the Prince of Wales can see the thick steel cables that literally keep the huge hotel from blowing away.
7316	9821	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
7317	9823	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Evening comes early in winter, and the glow from the lodge windows is an invitation.
7318	9824	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Just off the lobby is a small, cheery pub where we can sit by the fireplace and look out over the snowy wilderness.
7319	9825	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	As in many old inns, the rooms are each unique and range from cozy to spacious.
7320	9826	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But all have antique furniture, plump mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and sleep late.
7321	9827	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The rooms have no televisions, telephones or dataports, and there is no cell phone service
7322	9828	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	this is not the place for such intrusions.
7323	9829	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Dining at Kilmorey is a treat
7324	9831	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
7325	9834	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood- burning fireplace.
7326	9835	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	You can choose to take your coffee and dessert here after dinner.
7327	9836	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But it's always a quiet refuge, the perfect place to curl up with a good book, listen to the crackle of the fire and watch the softly falling snow deepen outside the door.
7328	9837	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Perhaps we'll be snowed in.
7329	9838	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We can always hope.

7383	9932	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The National Teachers' Association said Monday that teachers can make unruly students stand so that "they can reflect upon their wrongs."
7384	9933	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The association issued the clarification after the Apple Daily, a local tabloid, reported that the Ministry of Education will soon publish guidelines for teachers counselling or disciplining students.
7385	9934	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	One claim by the paper was that teachers, when disciplining students, would need their consent.
7386	9935	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The teachers will also not be able to demand students to do pushups or frog jumps if the purpose is to punish the students, according to the reports.
7387	9936	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Yang Yi-feng, an association official, said that in the future, there will be no such thing as a "disciplinary stand" and that the teachers will only require students "stand to reflect upon themselves."
7388	9937	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Since the purpose is for the students to reflect upon themselves, the teachers will not need to obtain the students' consent, he added.

7398	9950	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Forecasters said tropical storm conditions are possible on the island by late Saturday night.
7399	9951	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bertha had maximum sustained winds of about 90 mph (150 kph) with some higher gusting.
7400	9952	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm was barely moving but expected to chug north-northwest at about 5 mph (7 kph) later in the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
7401	9953	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm is expected to pass well east of Bermuda, although any inclination toward the west would create stronger winds.
7402	9954	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bermuda will likely receive up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain in the next two days.

7410	9963	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	The explosion -- the North African nation's second terror attack in less than 48 hours -- ripped through the northern coastal town of Dellys, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Algiers, shattering many of the town's windows.
7411	9964	APW_ENG_20070908.0481.LDC2009T13	In the confusion, security authorities initially gave a lower death toll before the APS agency released an official count by hospitals.

7477	10049	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	Local police in the south told AFP that as of Tuesday, 2,312 people had been killed in the bloody insurgency plaguing the area since violence erupted in 2004.
7478	10050	AFP_ENG_20070620.0123.LDC2009T13	The figure included militants killed in the unrest.

7483	10059	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	However, the company warned that delays in its new 787 Dreamliner program would weigh on its earnings in 2008.
7484	10060	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	For the full year 2007, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 5.28 dollars on higher commercial aircraft deliveries, strong growth in defense earnings, productivity gains and other factors, Boeing said.
7485	10061	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	That compared with 2006 net profit of 2.2 billion dollars and 2.85 dollars earnings per share.
7486	10062	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Boeing said that fourth-quarter net profit rose four percent to 1.03 billion dollars from the same period in 2006, with earnings per share at 1.36 dollars.
7487	10063	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	In 2006, profit was 989 million dollars, or 1.29 dollars a share.
7488	10064	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The results exceeded analysts' consensus forecast for earnings per share of 5.22 dollars for 2007 and 1.32 dollars in the fourth quarter.
7489	10065	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Revenue was virtually flat in the three months ended December 31, rising to 17.48 billion dollars from 17.54 billion in the same period a year earlier.
7490	10066	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The Dow component, citing earlier than expected productivity gains, lifted its outlook for fiscal 2008 to earnings of between 5.70 dollars and 5.85 dollars a share.
7491	10067	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	However, the company lowered its revenue outlook for 2008, to a range of 67 billion dollars to 68 billion, reflecting a previously disclosed delay in its new 787 Dreamliner program.
7492	10068	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The prior forecast was for revenue of 67.5 billion dollars to 68.5 billion for the year.

7494	10070	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The company said the outlook for its defense business and in- production commercial airplane programs remains "very strong" for 2009 and it continues to expect strong earnings per share growth for the year.
7495	10071	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Boeing said its total company backlog as of December 31 stood at 327 billion dollars, up 31 percent year-over-year, because of commercial airplane orders and defense program wins.
7496	10075	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"It will be a long and difficult investigation," said a source close to the case.
7497	10076	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Investigators were not ruling out any motive for the crime, saying it may have been the work of thieves acting at the behest of an art collector or small-time robbers wanting to get their hands on some valuable loot.
7498	10077	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The thieves made off with a 1961 portrait of Picasso's second wife Jacqueline Roque and "Maya with Doll," a painting of Picasso's daughter done in 1938.

7500	10080	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Art dealers and gallery owners have also been notified of the theft, he said.
7501	10081	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Darties said that 80 percent of cases involving thefts of major artworks, the perpetrators are "thieves who saw an opportunity", believing that they will cash in on the stolen works "but find themselves unable to sell them."
7502	10082	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Many stolen paintings by Picasso have been recovered over the years after police notified the art market of the theft.
7503	10083	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The risk however is that the perpetrators may decide to destroy the paintings if they find themselves unable to sell them, said Darties.
7504	10085	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"Maya With Doll" is one of Picasso's classic oil paintings done in bright shades of green, blue and red and depicting young Maya in pigtails holding a doll and a small wooden horse.

7536	10149	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va., farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a well.
7537	10150	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	With his leathery hands, he gripped the handles of two L-shaped copper rods, held them parallel, tucked his elbows into his ribs, puffed out his chest, marched a few paces back and forth and silently bid the earth to reveal its watery secrets.
7538	10151	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
7539	10152	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``There they go!''
7540	10153	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	said the 82-year-old grandfather and former book publisher -- and part-time water witch.
7541	10154	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Also known as dowsers, most water witches say they are born with a capacity to locate underground water by channeling its energy, or electromagnetism, or something loopy and twitchy of that kind that has yet to be named by science, through a pair of metal rods, a forked twig, a coat hanger, a pendulum or, in rare cases, acutely alert fingers.
7542	10155	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
7543	10156	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	A dry spell this summer has led Maryland and Virginia to seek drought relief for farmers and could prod more homeowners to turn to dowsers to find productive wells.
7544	10157	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But well drillers today are often uneasy with the practice.
7545	10159	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``I've seen a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've seen 'em miss.
7546	10160	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	And I can't say if it works.''
7547	10161	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Some people decry dowsing as the handiwork of the devil
7548	10162	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
7549	10163	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Others, in the name of rational skepticism, just call it bunk.
7550	10164	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
7551	10165	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
7552	10166	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
7553	10167	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His father preferred fresh limbs cut from a cherry or willow tree, but Shirley uses brass rods to pinpoint and drill where he believes underground streams cross -- a prime location for a multigallon-per-minute well.
7554	10168	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He will dowse only if clients permit, but nearly all do, said his wife, Jackie.
7555	10169	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Detractors say there's no hard proof that the method works.
7556	10170	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself ``strongly opposed'' to the practice.
7557	10171	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Experiments have shown that the odds of finding water through dowsing are no better than random attempts and that rods lack special powers, said Cliff Treyens, the association's public awareness director.
7558	10172	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
7559	10174	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
7560	10175	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Several dowsers who were interviewed said they work for free or charge a nominal fee.
7561	10176	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting groundwater wherever one digs.
7562	10177	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Dowsers and their supporters say that misses the point.
7563	10179	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He said dowsers found him plentiful supplies on three properties.
7564	10180	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The use of twigs and rods dates to biblical times, dowsers say.
7565	10181	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Over the centuries, practitioners uttered incantations to empower rods with divine grace to seek water and other hidden substances, from precious metals to lost cats to bad vibes.
7566	10182	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Lore has it that the term ``water witch'' derives not from a description of a person but rather from the witch hazel branches preferred by Anglo-Scottish immigrants.
7567	10184	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But they agree on the need for a clear mind and sharp focus.
7568	10185	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``It's kind of like a hammer is to a carpenter.
7569	10186	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The hammer doesn't build the house
7570	10187	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the carpenter does.
7571	10188	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The rod doesn't find water
7572	10189	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the dowser does,'' said dowser Tom Stewart, 61, of North Carolina, who recently retired as a teacher and started an online business selling his homemade rods.
7573	10190	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain.
7574	10191	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	By spinning clockwise for yes or counterclockwise for no, the pendulum channels a magnetism of sorts to answer questions that transcend matter, Fincham said.
7575	10193	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Cross had called Fincham, who learned the art of dowsing at a school in Arkansas, for a second opinion about where to drill a new well.
7576	10194	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``Relax.
7577	10195	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Don't try to grip 'em.
7578	10196	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Elbows by your sides,'' said Fincham, coaching his friend with the 18-inch rods.
7579	10197	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his knack with rods, an enigma.

7584	10204	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	The three areas are redesigning of global institutions, the globalization agenda, which should be an agenda of innovation but not of isolation or protectionism, and the environmental issue, especially climate change.

7590	10212	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference is the need for quantified national emission targets for industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the next 10-15 years.
7591	10213	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The IPCC suggests that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the range of 25-40 percent by 2020 is necessary in order to keep the earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsus.
7592	10214	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
7593	10215	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
7594	10216	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted by enthusiastic applause.
7595	10218	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed on Monday how the Adaptation Fund will operate, including its governing body, functions, secretariat, trustee and other institutional arrangements.
7596	10219	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an interim arrangement up for review every three years was a surprise to me," says one observer.
7597	10220	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"I think most of us are delighted to have finalized the Fund whether you like the precise details or not," adds another.
7598	10221	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with regard to developing countries.
7599	10222	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
7600	10223	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
7601	10224	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to.
7602	10225	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
7603	10227	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	During these last three days of the conference, Environment Ministers will seek to reach agreement on the shape of a future international climate pact, the so- called " Bali roadmap".
7604	10231	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	A sea of sobbing mourners, some wailing and beating their chests in a wrenching outpouring of emotion, flooded through security checkpoints into the graveyard in rural southern Garhi Khuda Bakhsh for the commemoration.
7605	10232	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Thick fog had stranded tens of thousands on the roads leading into the area early in the day, prompting authorities to delay the start of the proceedings, but began to lift after noon.
7606	10233	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Bhutto, 54, was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in a gun and suicide attack at a campaign rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, just two months after returning to Pakistan from exile to vie for a third term in power.
7607	10234	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Her shocking death threw the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic nation into chaos, sparking violence and leading to months of political turmoil that ended in September when her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, claimed the presidency.
7608	10235	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"In the tradition of a true Bhutto, she faced certain death rather than abandon her principles or the people," Zardari said in a message to the nation to mark the anniversary.
7609	10236	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"The tyrants and the killers have killed her but they shall never be able to kill her ideas, which drove and inspired a generation to lofty aims," he said, adding that democracy was the only way to fight militancy.
7610	10237	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	The masses travelled by train, bus, truck, car, bicycle and even on foot to mourn the charismatic, Oxford-educated Bhutto, the first woman to lead a Muslim nation who was hailed in the West as a face of moderation.
7611	10238	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Some slept Friday night in the open in near-freezing temperatures.
7612	10239	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Tariq Waseem, a 25-year-old student from southwestern Baluchistan province, walked about 400 kilometres (250 miles) over 10 days with about a dozen friends in order to be at Saturday's event.
7613	10240	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	But unlike his friends, he walked barefoot.
7614	10241	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"These are not painful," he told AFP, pointing with pride at blisters covering his soles.
7615	10242	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"These are a gift from my martyred leader."
7616	10243	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Local police official Tanvir Odho said about 150,000 mourners had flocked to the area to pay their respects to Bhutto.
7617	10244	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Ceremonies are expected to culminate with special prayers at 5:20 pm (1220 GMT) -- about the time Bhutto was attacked.
7618	10245	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	About 7,000 police and paramilitary rangers have fanned out around the tomb to protect Zardari, who has said he too is a target for extremists like those who killed Bhutto.
7619	10247	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	A special wall has been erected around the mausoleum as part of a raft of precautions taken to safeguard Zardari.
7620	10248	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Closed-circuit cameras have been installed, and mourners were required to pass through metal detectors.
7621	10249	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Both Zardari and the United Nations said they hoped a UN investigation would soon be launched into Bhutto's killing.
7622	10252	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of vendors did a brisk business selling Bhutto memorabilia -- posters, photographs and recordings of her speeches -- ahead of the ceremony.
7623	10253	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	The government has declared Saturday a national holiday in Bhutto's honour, and events were scheduled nationwide.
7624	10254	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Candlelight vigils were held late Friday in Rawalpindi and the southern port city of Karachi.
7625	10255	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Mohammad Ayaz, 48, from the central city of Multan, sobbed at Bhutto's graveside, gathering a few flower petals from the pile of wreaths and arrangements left in her honour.
7626	10256	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"My children will be blessed when they will touch these petals," he said.
7627	10261	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"There are things to negotiate," Umberto Bossi told lawmakers, according to the ANSA news agency.
7628	10262	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"We should review Schengen because we cannot go on like this," he added, without elaborating.
7629	10263	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	EU members can travel freely in the Schengen zone, which includes 22 of the bloc's 27 member states.
7630	10265	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the weekly Gente, Calderoli said: "The Schengen treaty was for European countries that were socio- economically homogeneous, which the new members are not.
7631	10266	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	Inevitably, the poorest sections of these populations spread west, increasing petty crime."
7632	10267	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The mid-April elections marked a breakthrough for the Northern League, which nearly doubled its strength in parliament with more than eight percent of the vote, prompting fears that the small anti-immigration party would unduly influence prime minister- elect Silvio Berlusconi's agenda.
7633	10268	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	The day after the elections, Berlusconi vowed to crack down on illegal immigrants, saying those involved in crime were part of an "army of evil."
7634	10271	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"We need more cleansing and more police," he told the leading daily Corriere della Sera, linking crime to "immigration, often clandestine."

7642	10293	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Mary-Kate Olsen calls Heath Ledger a "friend" in a brief statement released Friday, the first word from the "Full House" star since the Australian-born actor's death.
7643	10294	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Released by her publicist, the statement, in its entirety, reads:
7644	10295	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	"Heath was a friend.
7645	10296	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	His death is a tragic loss.
7646	10297	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	My thoughts are with his family during this very difficult time."
7647	10298	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police said the masseuse who found Ledger's body Tuesday spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialing the police-fire emergency dispatcher for help.
7648	10299	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	The masseuse called Olsen a fourth time after paramedics arrived.
7649	10300	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	At some point during the frenzy, Olsen, who was in California, summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help, police said.
7650	10301	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police told The Associated Press on Friday that they do not want to interview the actress in connection with the calls.
7651	10302	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Olsen's whereabouts were unknown Friday.
7652	10303	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	A private viewing was scheduled for Friday at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan, and Ledger's family was flying to the U.S. from his native Australia.
7653	10304	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	South Africa takes series 2-1 with innings win against West Indies in 3rd test
7654	10306	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Fast bowler Dale Steyn took six West Indies wickets on Saturday to lead South Africa to easy victory in the third test and a 2-1 win in the three-match series.
7655	10307	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn finished with 6-72 and South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs -- with two days to spare -- after West Indies' second innings ended at 317-9.
7656	10308	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unable to bat because of flu.
7657	10310	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	West Indies won the first test by 128 runs and South Africa leveled the series with a seven-wicket win in the second test.
7658	10311	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But West Indies faced an uphill task to save the third test after South Africa dismissed the visitors for 139 in their first innings at Kingsmead Stadium, and then scored 556-4 in reply.
7659	10312	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	After a fourth-wicket stand of 144 between Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo, Steyn struck with the second new ball of the innings, dismissing Bravo leg before wicket for 75 soon after tea.
7660	10313	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But Samuels managed to bring up his second test century, making 105 off 190 balls with 18 boundaries.
7661	10314	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We fought well," Bravo said.
7662	10315	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We must remember South Africa is the No. 2 team in the world, and we are a young team with new coaching staff."
7663	10316	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Despite winning the series, South Africa dropped two places to fourth spot in test rankings, the International Cricket Council said.
7664	10317	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Australia remained top.
7665	10318	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Denesh Ramdin stayed with Samuels and made 25 before Andre Nel tempted him to flash at a wide delivery outside the off stump and give an easy catch to Mark Boucher.
7666	10319	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shortly after making his century, Samuels fell to a delivery from Steyn which clipped his off stump.
7667	10320	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	The dismissal signaled a collapse for West Indies, and Steyn ripped through the rest of the tail.
7668	10321	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Darren Sammy was out for 17 in a looping caught-and-bowled by Steyn, who also hit the offstumps of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards -- both for ducks -- to wrap up the match.
7669	10322	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the series at an average of 19.10.
7670	10323	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Samuels and Bravo saw West Indies reach 230-3 at tea after a poor start to the day.
7671	10324	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Resuming on their overnight total of 23, opening batsmen Darren Ganga and Brenton Parchment added 10 more runs before Parchment was trapped leg before wicket by Steyn for 20.
7672	10325	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
7673	10326	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before wicket for 37.
7674	10327	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut back in on him.
7675	10328	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock, 34, later announced it was his last test.
7676	10329	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"It's great to be able to finish my test career on my home ground, and especially in a match where the guys played so well," said Pollock, who said he would retire from international cricket after the one-day series against West Indies that finishes next month.
7677	10330	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"But with Dale bowling so well, they don't need me," added Pollock, who took a record 421 test wickets for South Africa at an average of 23.11.
7678	10331	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock also averaged 32.31 with the bat, hitting a total of 3,781 test runs.
7679	10333	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"I hope the whole of South Africa knows what a great player will be missing from our team now, he is one of the all-time greats," Smith said.
7680	10334	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Also Saturday, Parchment was fined half his match fee by the ICC after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct.
7681	10335	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"In the eighth over of West Indies second innings, Parchment intentionally ran into opposition fast bowler Dale Steyn," the ICC statement said.
7682	10336	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Parchment has the right of appeal.

7687	10342	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	The win gives Roma 71 points, one behind Inter which played Fiorentina later Sunday.
7688	10343	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Juventus is third with 61 followed by Fiorentina at 56.
7689	10344	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	"The question about whether things are still open depends on what Inter does," said Roma coach Luciano Spalletti.
7690	10345	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	"We have to try not to make any mistakes in these last games."

7693	10352	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	and Reggina 1, Sampdoria 0.
7694	10356	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Totti looked rusty, missing several good scoring chances and was substituted in the 76th.
7695	10357	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Both teams started the game at a furious pace, creating several scoring opportunities.
7696	10358	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Taddei saved a shot from Udinese striker Fabio Quagliarella on the goal-line in the 33rd, and Totti came close on a free kick as time expired in the first half.
7697	10359	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Before the victory over Udinese, Roma had managed just one win in its previous five away games.
7698	10360	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	The goals by Vucinic, Taddei and Giuly were the sixth of the Serie A season for each player.
7699	10361	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	"It's not the first time we come back for a win and that's a sign of a great team," said Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi.

7702	10364	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	In the late game, Fiorentina's attacking duo of Adrian Mutu and Giampaolo Pazzini, who have combined for 25 Serie A goals this season, will be looking to break through Inter's injury-depleted defense.
7703	10365	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Striker Mario Balotelli, who scored his first goal in Serie A last weekend, will get his second straight start for Inter as Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to be sidelined with an injury.

7706	10370	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China should be commended, and an expanded sustainable forestry will both offset carbon emissions and produce development dividends," said Oxley, adding that China's efforts have largely been ignored at the climate talks in Poznan.
7707	10371	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	According to a new report by World Growth, China pledged in 2006 to expand the country's forest area to 20 percent of total land by 2010, which would increase the size of China's total carbon sink by 50 million tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly enough to offset the emissions of the entire country of Sweden for a whole year.
7708	10372	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China's approach to climate change is fully consistent with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which encourages attention to climate change adaptation.
7709	10373	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China is seeking to improve energy efficiency to reduce emission rates and it is also expanding its forest sinks, which are tangible measures to reduce emission rates, Oxley said.
7710	10374	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, given the need for China to continue to raise living standards and develop the economy, an overall increase in emissions for some time is yet inevitable," he added.
7711	10375	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"This is understandable, China has also indicated that a key aim is to adapt to the impacts of climate change."

7713	10378	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Yet it is still being ignored by negotiators in industrialized economies.

7754	10435	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The Beijing municipal government will quadruple the maximum premium for each person who discloses the production and sale of illegal firecrackers, raising the reward from 5,000 yuan (688 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 yuan.
7755	10436	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The government also promised a "special reward" for those who provide information that leads to an important discovery, without elaborating.
7756	10437	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	"The scale of the illegal firecracker business has expanded in line with the increasing demand of fireworks with the Spring Festival around the corner," said an official with the city's Firework Safety Administration Office.
7757	10438	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	A reward of 280,000 yuan has been granted to reporters since last Spring Festival and a total of 106 people involved in 95 cases have been arrested, according to local government.
7758	10439	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Beijing tightened control over illegal firecracker production this year by launching a crackdown on substandard firecracker workshops throughout the city.

7802	10511	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Yet for all the talk of a crackdown, the game goes on.
7803	10512	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	And to Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship between those who control the game and those who make and enforce the laws.
7804	10513	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the 1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
7805	10515	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.

7828	10542	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the leftist Workers' Party.

7831	10547	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterward, da Silva, who had originally favored legalizing the animal game, issued a temporary decree outlawing bingo parlors.
7832	10548	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But the Senate refused to make the measure permanent.
7833	10549	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros and their associates have obtained judicial rulings, many of them issued by judges later arrested, that have blunted the effect of the prohibition.
7834	10550	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Da Silva's chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, has now indicated that the government is considering an about-face and is at least willing to study the possibility of legalizing the animal game.

7848	10568	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Strong opposition to the candidacy of Barack Obama in Arkansas may have helped conservatives pass a measure blocking the adoption of children by unmarried couples.
7849	10569	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The measure, which voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday and which prevents unmarried cohabitating couples from adopting or fostering children, won strong support from conservatives, exit polls found.
7850	10570	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The ban affects all unmarried couples but was written with the intent of preventing gay couples from raising children in Arkansas.
7851	10571	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Unlike most states, Arkansas shifted to the right politically in this election.
7852	10573	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"I think white Arkansas Democrats felt cross-pressured in this race," said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College.
7853	10574	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"They didn't want to vote for what they viewed as Bush's third term, but they also couldn't bring themselves to vote for Barack Obama.
7854	10575	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	One response was just to bow out of voting, and their absence probably helped this proposal succeed."
7855	10576	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Many experts did not expect the measure to pass with Democrats nationwide flooding the polls to support Obama for president.
7856	10578	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Critics ran television advertisements of foster children pleading with voters not to make it harder for them to find families.
7857	10579	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	But conservatives mounted a grass-roots campaign, mainly through church groups, that framed the state's case-by-case approach to adoption requests as an affront to traditional family values.
7858	10581	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"But we also believe in blunting a gay agenda that we see at work in other states with regard to marriage and adoption issues."
7859	10582	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Exit polls found that the ban was primarily supported by conservatives, supporters of Bush and evangelicals.
7860	10583	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	After the votes were tallied, adoption groups decried the new policy as contrary to the well-being of children.
7861	10585	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	He said the ban would make adoptions less common.
7862	10586	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Arkansas is not the first state with such a policy.
7863	10587	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Florida prohibits adoption by applicants who identify themselves as gay, Utah prevents unmarried cohabitated couples from adopting and Mississippi specifically bans same-sex couples from adopting.
7864	10588	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	A survey in October by the University of Arkansas found 55 percent of voters in the state opposed to the ban.
7865	10589	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	But conservatives ratcheted up their lobbying before the election, distributing 350,000 inserts for church bulletins, and the measure passed with nearly 57 percent of the vote.
7866	10590	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"I was very surprised that our margin of victory was as wide as it was," Cox said.
7867	10591	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"Our campaign was primarily grass-roots.
7868	10592	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The opposition was primarily a media campaign.

7872	10596	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Special to The Hartford Courant
7873	10597	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed concert.
7874	10598	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	In 1974, I went to the exquisite Waterbury Palace Theater.
7875	10599	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Pulsating strobe lights reflected Reed's disposition.
7876	10601	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Three decades later, it's all changed.
7877	10602	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage thing in the '70s.
7878	10603	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll concert.
7879	10604	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Now, the music's almost over.
7880	10605	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts might squeeze out another decade, but in the scope of things, that's nearing the end.
7881	10606	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I've been there, from the smoke-filled general admission arenas where armband-wearing employees led the too-stoned to a backroom cot, to today's reserved seating shows where one flash of a digital camera gets you scolded by security.
7882	10607	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From bowling alley music halls to stadiums of 40,000.
7883	10608	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From Bic lighter encores to open cell-phone salutes.
7884	10609	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
7885	10610	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It's all been part of a living museum.
7886	10611	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts are an invaluable art form.
7887	10612	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They're exhibitions of the masters, music as their medium, the stage their easel.
7888	10613	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	If I could collect them like paintings, I would.
7889	10614	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The closest I come to collecting is buying tickets
7890	10615	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands I saw 30 years ago.
7891	10616	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and, recently, my four tickets for Lou Reed.
7892	10617	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Though the music still rocks, perhaps even more than in the past, the musicians have become pensive with decades of life behind them.
7893	10618	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed -- appearing at the Calvin Theatre in Northhampton, Mass. -- sang of the guardian angel who saved him rather than of the white heat that once ran through his veins.
7894	10619	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	At the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach this summer, Stevie Nicks' first words were "Through good grace, you're here.
7895	10620	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	When we get older, we learn to appreciate what we have more."
7896	10621	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller closed his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other."
7897	10622	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Most of them call for peace.
7898	10623	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So, there is a sadness to the concerts this time around.
7899	10624	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Time is no longer on their side.
7900	10625	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Each tour now may be that band's last.
7901	10626	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly done, approaching historical status.
7902	10627	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My 18-year-old daughter discovered the recent Lou Reed concert in a local arts newspaper and insisted that we attend.
7903	10629	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	To this day, we're sorry.
7904	10630	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	What if we never get another chance?
7905	10631	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So my daughter's logic, rightly so, was that someday Mr. Reed won't be around to perform.
7906	10632	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We both know that day will be sooner now, rather than later.
7907	10633	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty years of his concerts no longer unfurl before us.
7908	10634	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The clock is ticking, not only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
7909	10635	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So we buy tickets to beat that clock.
7910	10636	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Our summer lined up with bands that may never tour again.
7911	10637	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
7912	10638	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Stevie Nicks.
7913	10639	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed.
7914	10640	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller.
7915	10641	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band.
7916	10642	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love, reached our ears.
7917	10643	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My children heard a Beatle sing.
7918	10644	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will not.
7919	10645	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will never see Mr. Reed, alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking transformation.
7920	10646	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will not watch Mike Love consider if everybody had an ocean, surfboards set on the stage, Mr. Love giving the peace sign.
7921	10647	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will never see Mick Jagger insist he likes it, this thing called rock 'n' roll, as he struts past Keith Richards on a seven-story stage.
7922	10648	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Liza Minnelli will never invite their children to "Come, hear the music play."
7923	10649	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
7924	10650	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	This millennium's music has no Billy Joel defining the king and queen of the prom.
7925	10652	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no John Fogerty penning scathing lyrics against the war.
7926	10653	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no Freddie Mercury rocking out stadium anthems.
7927	10654	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
7928	10655	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Beatle.
7929	10656	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music.
7930	10657	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert now is a gift.
7931	10658	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert takes another little piece of my heart with the final encore.
7932	10659	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The imminence is palpable, of the exhibit closing, of the stage lights going dark.

7944	10678	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Stocks fell sharply in early trading Friday after Wachovia Corp. said it expects to increase quarterly loan losses, raising investor concern about the continuing credit crisis.
7945	10679	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that credit market volatility could cause a $1.1 billion (euro0.75 billion) writedown for October alone.
7946	10680	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The problem stems from its asset-backed securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, that have lost value on sinking investor demand.

7951	10688	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	China and Australia upgraded their security ties Thursday, announcing annual talks on international issues and overseeing a new energy trade deal that underscores their flourishing economic relations.
7952	10690	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	The two also discussed climate change -- the core issue at a weekend summit of Pacific Rim leaders.

7955	10696	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"China's growth is undeniably good for the world.
7956	10697	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	It has been undeniably good for Australia," Howard said.
7957	10698	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Taking the podium after him, Hu echoed Howard, saying, "China's sound and steady economic growth has not only benefited China's 1.3 billion people, but also offered enormous business opportunities to other countries."
7958	10699	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's visit was not friction-free.
7959	10701	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On climate change, Howard is seeking a strong endorsement for a new approach to global warming from the leaders at the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
7960	10702	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu, however, only reiterated China's stock position -- that while global warming is a problem, it is largely the fault and responsibility of already industrialized nations.
7961	10703	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	In an indirect slap at Howard's agenda for APEC, Hu said he hoped that the summit's declaration would note that U.N.-sponsored talks "should remain the main channel" for the international efforts to tackle climate change.
7962	10704	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	While the new security talks between Australia and China, which will be convened by foreign ministers next year, marks an upgrade in ties, its announcement comes as Australia also upgrades its security ties with Pacific allies the United States and Japan, who are traditional or potential rivals with China.
7963	10707	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Asked by reporters if the Australia-U.S.-Japan dialogue represented a threat to China, Hu said the countries involved were better able to explain their intentions.
7964	10708	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard said the three-way talks were not directed at China, whose rapid military buildup has been a source of concern in Washington and other regional capitals.

8000	10773	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
8001	10774	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea transplant.
8002	10775	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
8003	10776	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.
8004	10777	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This isn't terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened yesterday.
8005	10778	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	(Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie critics.)
8006	10779	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of Hong Kong.
8007	10780	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a surprise, the movie was a drag.
8008	10782	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	.
8009	10783	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
8010	10784	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But we've been here before, no?
8011	10785	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
8012	10786	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's a notch above this, their Hollywood debut.
8013	10787	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The noise and cheap bumps in the night from the Pangs' movie have been toned down, but without them you realize that atmosphere was all the Pangs had going for them.
8014	10788	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.
8015	10789	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But Alba, with her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan").
8016	10790	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.
8017	10791	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But even Hewitt's face has a range of feeling.
8018	10792	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Her voice has pleasingly rich character.
8019	10793	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"
8020	10794	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She narrates "The Eye."
8021	10795	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.
8022	10796	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	"People say seeing is believing... Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."
8023	10797	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	All I can see is jeans.
8024	10798	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alba spends a lot of her scenes with Parker Posey, who plays Sydney's guilty sister
8025	10799	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alessandro Nivola, who plays her sight therapist
8026	10800	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
8027	10802	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.
8028	10803	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But they are here enough for you to appreciate the experience in their faces versus the disruptive purity in their costar's.
8029	10804	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
8030	10805	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished niceness she radiates on screen.
8031	10806	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's terrible for horror or action or comedy or drama.
8032	10807	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But it's perfect for, say, water.
8033	10808	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She was never more convincing than she was as Paul Walker's moral- minded girlfriend in the tropical thriller "Into the Blue."
8034	10809	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.
8035	10810	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	If she's going to keep doing fright movies, maybe she can be the Esther Williams of horror.

8051	10833	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Oct. 9 (Xinhua)
8052	10834	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The eurozone economy is now on the brink of recession as the financial crisis is devastating the 15-nation bloc sharing the euro currency.
8053	10835	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	For the first time, economic growth in the eurozone recorded a quarterly decrease in the three months from April to June this year, figures from the European Union (EU)'s statistics bureau Eurostat showed Wednesday.
8054	10836	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	But things have been getting worse after the negative growth in the second quarter, mainly due to the escalating financial crisis, which suggests that there is little chance of the eurozone economy rebounding in the following months.
8055	10837	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In technical terms, recession means negative growth in two consecutive quarters.
8056	10838	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	As EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday, forecasts of a recession in Europe and the United States could become the "central scenario."
8057	10839	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Forecasts for recessions on both sides of the Atlantic "run the risk of becoming the central scenario in the coming months," Almunia told a conference in Madrid, Spain.
8058	10840	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The financial crisis, which originated in the United States, has deepened in Europe in recent weeks, with several European banks falling prey to the global credit crunch, prompting EU governments to save their banks by injecting large amounts of money or even nationalizing them.
8059	10841	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Without any knowledge of which one would be the next victim, financial institutions in the eurozone have become extremely reluctant to lend to each other, resulting in a more serious credit crunch.
8060	10842	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Despite furious efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject liquidity into the financial markets, no big turn was observed.
8061	10843	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Economists fear that a prolonged money market freeze would have a significant impact on overall lending to businesses and individuals, undermining confidence and threatening the real economy.
8062	10844	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Figures from the European Commission showed that economic confidence in the eurozone continued to fall in September, hitting the lowest level since November 2001, i.e. shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, while the business climate decreased significantly to values last observed in 2003.
8063	10845	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Last month, Almunia warned that the financial crisis is hurting Europe's real economy.
8064	10846	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"There can be no doubt that events in the financial sector are hurting the real economy," he told a European Parliament plenary session.
8065	10847	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Almunia said the effects of the financial turmoil have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and the severe housing market corrections in some EU member states.

8071	10853	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Official figures showed that consumption expenditure, investment and exports, the three major economic engines in the eurozone, all cooled down in the second quarter, decreasing from the previous three months by 0.2, 1.0 and 0.2 percent respectively.

8079	10862	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO 2007-11-13 22:19:16 UTC
8080	10863	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday suspended all fishing in areas affected by last week's San Francisco Bay oil spill, calling what was the area's worst spill in nearly two decades an "unbelievable human failure" and promising an investigation.
8081	10864	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
8082	10865	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State Association of Counties annual meeting.
8083	10866	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Then on top of it, it takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
8084	10867	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
8085	10868	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
8086	10869	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A Coast Guard places a skimming vessel at the scene within 80 minutes.
8087	10870	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
8088	10871	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
8089	10872	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Believe me, we will ask the tough questions that need to be asked."
8090	10873	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Coast Guard officials defended their response as "by the book," but concede mistakes in their communication with the public.
8091	10874	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
8092	10875	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000 gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
8093	10878	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
8094	10879	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
8095	10880	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas will be closed to fishing.
8096	10881	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood caught in areas impacted by the spill.
8097	10882	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
8098	10883	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
8099	10885	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
8100	10886	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.
8101	10887	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on problems involving management and communication between the officers on the ship's bridge at the time.
8102	10888	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
8103	10889	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Darrell Wilson, a representative for Regal Stone, said the company was eager to hear the results of the investigation.
8104	10890	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.
8105	10891	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We take our job of environmental stewardship very seriously."

8107	10895	AFP_ENG_20070324.0059.LDC2009T13	The officer blamed the crash on speeding by the two drivers.

8186	10984	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Analysts had expected gas inventories to rise by 2 million barrels.
8187	10985	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gas stockpiles are 6 percent lower than inventories in the same week a year ago.
8188	10986	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Refinery utilization, which had been expected to grow by 0.8 percent, fell 0.4 percent to 89.2 percent, the second straight weekly decline.
8189	10987	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Most analysts say refineries should be using 94 percent to 95 percent of their capacity at this time of year.
8190	10988	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Crude oil inventories rose by 100,000 barrels last week, when analysts had expected a 400,000-barrel decline.
8191	10989	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose 300,000 barrels a day, falling short of expectations for a 1.5 million barrel-per-day increase.
8192	10990	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	U.S. refiners reported an unusually high number of outages this spring, crimping gasoline supplies.
8193	10991	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Reports of outages continued on Wednesday, with Valero Energy Corp. saying it was shutting down a machine at its Ardmore, Okla., refinery for maintenance.
8194	10992	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	"The gasoline supply in the U.S. looks to be a key factor driving the crude oil market.

8196	10994	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Geopolitical factors also continue to provide a floor for oil prices, he said.
8197	10996	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Calls for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output have also largely been ignored, with the cartel stressing that supplies are sufficient.

8200	11000	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	John McCain's health care plan would reduce the ranks of the roughly 45 million uninsured Americans by about 21.1 million people if fully implemented by 2010, while Barack Obama's would reduce the number by 26.6 million, a new analysis predicts.
8201	11001	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Some previous reviews of the two presidential candidates' health plans indicated that Republican McCain's proposals would amount to little more than a wash when it comes to the number of uninsured in the United States.
8202	11002	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The analysis released Wednesday by The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, drew a more optimistic scenario about the overall number of people who would get health coverage under McCain's plan.
8203	11003	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The cost for both candidates' plans are enormous.
8204	11004	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain's plan was projected to cost more than $2 trillion from 2010 through 2019.
8205	11005	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Democrat Obama's plan would cost $1.17 trillion.
8206	11006	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Neither candidate provides specifics on how to cover the costs, The Lewin Group said.
8207	11007	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The United States, which has a population of about 300 million, is one of the few western countries without universal health care.
8208	11008	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain has proposed two distinct changes to the current system.
8209	11009	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The first is a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals or $5,000 for a family that buys health insurance.
8210	11010	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The credit would replace the tax break people now get for obtaining health coverage through their work.
8211	11011	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Second, McCain calls for letting people shop across state lines when buying insurance, essentially letting millions bypass states where insurance is more expensive and comprehensive.
8212	11012	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	About half of the nation's uninsured adults are ages 19-34.
8213	11013	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	They are the youngest and cheapest to cover, and they are the ones that would generally gain coverage under McCain's proposal, Sheils said.
8214	11014	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Obama's plan would expand health insurance coverage through public programs.
8215	11015	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	He requires all children to have health coverage.
8216	11016	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	In all, about 16 million people would gain coverage through those programs.
8217	11017	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Another 10 million would use government subsidies to buy insurance coverage.

8232	11038	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The latest spate of hostage takings began last year following a resurgence of hostilities between the ethnic Tuareg rebels and the government of the two countries.

8238	11048	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
8239	11050	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Now he was spending his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather evidence against Taylor.
8240	11051	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	At night he watched baseball with court officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
8241	11052	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I told them we believe," Bility says.
8242	11053	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"We always believe."
8243	11054	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	What Bility believes in most is the power of an independent press.
8244	11057	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor, who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone.
8245	11058	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."

8249	11062	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
8250	11063	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He's regained feeling in an arm numbed by the torture, but his shoulder still bothers him.
8251	11065	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He resisted Taylor's insistence that he accept exile once freed but acquiesced after a prison guard passed him a note from his mother imploring him to agree to flee.
8252	11067	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He now speaks and writes about his troubled homeland.
8253	11069	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and is expected to last at least a year.
8254	11070	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor was president of Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in 2003.
8255	11071	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape, mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its abundant natural resources.
8256	11072	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.

8264	11084	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility was first arrested the year Taylor was elected president.
8265	11085	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on trial.
8266	11086	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"That issue was taboo," Bility recalls.
8267	11087	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I reported on it extensively.
8268	11088	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	My colleagues said, 'You are reckless.

8271	11091	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was released after two days without having been charged.
8272	11092	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
8273	11093	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There he reported on gang rapes, mass arrests, and executions.
8274	11094	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
8275	11095	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Government agents pretending to peddle a corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4 -year-old son.
8276	11096	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to Taylor's home, Bility recalls.

8278	11098	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	'Gentlemen, this is the guy who wants to overthrow me,"' Bility says.

8280	11100	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is sitting on the floor.

8285	11106	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He spent the next six months incommunicado in various prison cells, including one underground hole only 3 feet high and half-filled with water.
8286	11107	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
8287	11108	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
8288	11110	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
8289	11111	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"If I had a heart condition," Bility says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
8290	11112	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once Taylor visited him in prison.
8291	11113	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
8292	11114	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He looked up and said, 'My birds.'
8293	11115	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That scared me."
8294	11116	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Through all this, Bility never made a false confession.
8295	11117	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
8296	11118	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His first inkling that his plight had attracted international attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong.
8297	11119	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
8298	11120	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"From that day on I had hope."
8299	11121	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Coming to Boston
8300	11122	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The torture stopped, and for two months Bility's captors worked to make him presentable to the outside world.

8304	11126	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
8305	11128	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Finally, Bility agreed to leave Liberia.
8306	11130	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
8307	11131	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	And he had heard of the Celtics.
8308	11132	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In January 2003, Bility moved to Massachusetts.
8309	11133	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He neglected advice to seek counseling to help him recover from the torture he'd suffered.

8366	11235	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Children's Cold Remedies Raised Questions for Years
8367	11236	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
8368	11237	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a pediatrician and father of two young boys.
8369	11238	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Kids with colds were getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either effective or safe."
8370	11239	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
8371	11240	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The case has also raised many questions: How could the products remain on the market for so long without proof they work?
8372	11241	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
8373	11242	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the medical establishment warn parents?
8374	11243	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
8375	11244	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
8376	11245	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
8377	11246	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to children that have never been tested in children," Michael Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
8378	11247	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
8379	11248	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group.
8380	11249	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You're just left scratching your head about how this could go on for so long."
8381	11250	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the market before government requirements for stringent testing, and it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in children.
8382	11251	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had authority to regulate them closely.
8383	11252	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
8384	11253	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
8385	11254	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
8386	11255	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The over-the-counter drug review was never made a priority in the agency, and so it dragged on for years and years."
8387	11256	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
8388	11257	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
8389	11258	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
8390	11260	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"We now understand that we can organize studies in children and don't have to extrapolate from adults.
8391	11261	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But that wasn't the case back then."
8392	11262	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were made for children and the products never again received any kind of detailed scrutiny.
8393	11263	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions.
8394	11265	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a similar conclusion in 2004.
8395	11266	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
8396	11267	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Where do parents get a lot of their information?
8397	11268	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	If you are a desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and your kid has a cold what do you do?
8398	11269	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
8399	11272	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I think there was a vacuum in leadership on this issue by the professional societies," Lurie said.
8400	11273	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
8401	11276	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"What has that done?
8402	11277	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In this case we're up against multibillion-dollar industry.
8403	11279	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	We try to do what we can, but there's only so much we can do.
8404	11280	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where are the companies in this?
8405	11281	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
8406	11282	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But Sharfstein and others wonder whether the medical profession could have been more aggressive.
8407	11283	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"When I was trained as a pediatrician it was just accepted that these products had no role.
8408	11284	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
8409	11285	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a fair question why there wasn't a strong regulatory challenge by the profession.
8410	11286	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	They could have justified one.
8411	11287	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But what really stunned us was that this was never really looked at from the legal-regulatory side."
8412	11288	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Using powers it received from two new laws, the FDA has begun demanding some prescription drugs be tested in children before being approved, and it has enticed drug companies to conduct pediatric studies of those already on the market.
8413	11289	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
8414	11290	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
8415	11291	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The FDA is now reviewing last week's recommendations, but because of the history of the products it says any formal action could take years.
8416	11292	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers to organize studies of the products.
8417	11293	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The industry has voluntarily withdrawn products designed for children younger than 2, but it maintains that the remedies are both safe and effective for older children when used properly, blaming the problems primarily on overdoses.
8418	11294	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"If the industry decides to dig in its heels against the clear guidance of the advisory committee I hope the FDA has the ability to stop them," Sharfstein said.
8419	11295	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a very small risk, unquestionably.
8420	11296	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But if you don't have evidence that the products work and you have kids who have died from taking them, I don't think there's a role for them."
8421	11298	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-07-04 13:51:18 UTC
8422	11299	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers say a museum in central Japan has right whale fossils that are at least 5 million years old, making them the oldest fossilized remains of the animal in the world, officials said Wednesday.
8423	11301	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The oldest right whale fossil previously found was a skeleton that was uncovered in Italy that dates back about 4 million years, Narita said.
8424	11302	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	"This was an amazing find, and to have found the oldest one of this type makes it truly remarkable," he said.
8425	11303	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground.
8426	11304	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	However, the skeleton was left undisturbed because the country was then at war, according to the museum's Web site.

8437	11317	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua)
8438	11318	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	Montenegro on Monday joined the European Union (EU)'s Competitiveness and Innovation Program (CIP), following the footsteps of three fellow candidate and potential candidate countries aspiring to join the EU.
8439	11319	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	Croatia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia joined the CIP in October 2007, while Turkey did so in February this year.
8440	11321	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	European Commissioner Gunter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, said Montenegro's joining the CIP "confirms its European aspirations."
8441	11322	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	"Participation in CIP, and, in particular the cooperation in the new Enterprise Europe Network, which Montenegro has already successfully entered, will help Montenegro to increase the competitiveness of its enterprises, in particular SMEs," he added.
8442	11323	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	According to the European Commission, the possibility of participating in a host of joint projects and in Enterprise Europe Network with the 27 EU member states is a substantial advantage for Montenegro.
8443	11324	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	It will allow the country to take full benefit of best practices on entrepreneurship, SMEs policy, competitiveness and innovation in the EU.
8444	11328	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	The CIP, which runs from 2007 to 2013 with a budget of 3.6 billion euros (some 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), contains the following three pillars.
8445	11329	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	-- Entrepreneurship and Innovation Framework Program (EIP): EIP fosters the competitiveness of enterprises for example by providing co-guarantees and co- investments for local banks and risk capital funds so that they can improve access for SMEs to loan and venture capital finance.
8446	11330	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	EIP also supports providers of business and innovation services in all EU regions or helps to link innovation actors and clusters in European networks.
8447	11331	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	-- Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Program (ICTPSP): ICTPSP accelerates the development of a sustainable, competitive, innovative and inclusive information society stimulating a wider adoption and more efficient take up and better use of information and communication technologies.

8450	11334	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	retires from tennis
8451	11336	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Martina Hingis said Thursday she has been accused of testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon, and then announced her retirement from professional tennis.
8452	11337	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
8453	11338	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous that I've decided to confront it head on by talking to the press," she said.
8454	11339	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I am frustrated and angry.
8455	11340	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I believe that I am absolutely 100 percent innocent."
8456	11341	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Her voice broke as she fought back tears in reading the statement.
8457	11342	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	At the end, she took no questions and left the news conference.
8458	11344	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said the positive test, which could lead to a doping suspension of up to two years, led to her retirement because she doesn't want to spend years fighting the case.
8459	11345	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
8460	11346	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis returned to the sport two years ago after a four-year absence because of injuries.
8461	11349	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	On March 31, 1997, Hingis became the youngest female player ever to lead the world rankings.
8462	11350	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She was 16 years, 6 months and 1 day at the time.
8463	11351	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She is currently ranked No. 19.
8464	11352	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, who lost in the third round of the U.S. Open, hasn't played since her second-round loss to Peng Shuai of China, 7-5, 6-1, in Beijing on Sept. 19.
8465	11354	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Both were banned for three months and ordered to return prize money and forfeit rankings points.
8466	11355	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Others have tested positive for a variety of banned substances.
8467	11356	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she was accused by "an outsource testing company" of taking cocaine during Wimbledon.
8468	11357	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She said she was "shocked and appalled" when notified that her urine sample came back positive after the loss to Granville.
8469	11358	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.
8470	11359	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.
8471	11360	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I only know that if I were to try to hit the ball while in any state of euphoria, it simply wouldn't work.
8472	11361	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I would think that it would be impossible for anyone to maintain the coordination required to play top class tennis while under the influence of drugs.
8473	11362	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	And I know one other thing -- I would personally be terrified of taking drugs."
8474	11363	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she later underwent a privately arranged hair test which came back negative for cocaine.
8475	11364	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The official backup "B" sample test on her Wimbledon urine sample, however, tested positive for the drug.
8476	11365	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample taken during Wimbledon.
8477	11366	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.
8478	11367	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said it could take years to fight her case.
8479	11368	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials," she said.
8480	11369	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me, physically, to keep playing at the top of the game.
8481	11370	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"And frankly, accusations such as these don't exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so."
8482	11371	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Widmer said the test was on June 29 but that Hingis heard about the positive result in mid-September and the positive 'B' sample two or three weeks later.
8483	11372	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She has great angst over this," Widmer said.
8484	11373	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She is heartbroken.
8485	11374	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	... It's crazy.
8486	11375	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	It's very complicated and complex."
8487	11377	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"However, it is important to remember that in the area of anti- doping, all players are presumed innocent until proven otherwise," Scott said.
8488	11378	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Referring to her retirement, he said, "Martina Hingis is a tremendous champion and a fan favorite the world over.
8489	11379	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	In her most recent comeback, she proved again that she can perform at the very highest levels of the game."
8490	11382	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"We deeply regret that Martina Hingis ended her outstanding career under the circumstances of such accusations."
8491	11389	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"What really annoyed me was that there was one phase in the the second half where we were in the Welsh 22 for five minutes where Jason Robinson was stood totally unmarked on the wing, 15 metres out, with the play going around him and was completely ignored," Ashton said.
8492	11390	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"Jason on his own against three defenders, you give him the ball in that situation and I think there were two or three occasions where we did create opportunities and the communication system broke down for some reason.
8493	11391	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	That's what I'll be looking to improve."
8494	11393	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	However, Ashton was adamant England hadn't simply played a 'nine- man' game against Wales.
8495	11394	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't all that tight a game at all.
8496	11395	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	There was a real mixture," he said.
8497	11396	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"In the first half I remember our backs taking their guys on in the middle of the field one-on-one and making clean line breaks which we should have finished off.
8498	11397	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"There's not much point whizzing the ball all over the park when you are five metres out and you've got a pack that can score without passing it.
8499	11398	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"The good news was we showed quite a bit of balance to our game.
8500	11399	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half and our kicking game came into play with our last two tries."
8501	11402	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He has worked incredibly hard after a pretty informal chat in South Africa about his body shape," said Ashton of Perry.
8502	11403	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He looks a better player for it.
8503	11405	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He very rarely makes mistakes, his distribution is good and he puts players through holes.
8504	11406	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He played like Andy Farrell can play.
8505	11407	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"And I thought Danny did some good stuff.
8506	11408	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He didn't look out of place, he didn't look fazed at all.
8507	11409	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	That is pressure at the highest level, coming in for his first cap, knowing you have to make a statement otherwise you might not get selected for the World Cup.
8508	11410	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"I was pretty pleased with the performance.
8509	11411	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	If someone said we would win 62-5 I would have found it hard to believe."

8552	11480	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks," said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University, who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.
8553	11481	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
8554	11483	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Charles Lu of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the trial's lead investigator, said there was reason to believe the cartilage might work.
8555	11484	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Cartilage has been found to contain factors that can impede the formation of blood vessels.
8556	11485	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And cutting off the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with other drugs.
8557	11486	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had died by that point.
8558	11487	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Those who got a placebo had a median survival of 15.6 months.
8559	11488	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
8560	11489	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage extract was given as a liquid that the patients drank twice a day.
8561	11490	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Results were somewhat more promising, though far less definitive, for flaxseed.
8562	11491	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center, involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have their prostates removed.
8563	11492	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	After the glands were removed about a month later, the tumors were studied.
8564	11493	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It was found that the tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did not.
8565	11494	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight fatigue, which is common in people with cancer.
8566	11495	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The study involved 282 patients with various types of cancer.
8567	11496	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	About one quarter of the patients who took one of the two higher doses of powdered extract of ginseng root, either 1,000 or 2,000 milligrams a day, reported that their fatigue had become "moderately better" or "much better."
8568	11497	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That contrasted with only one 10th of those who took either a smaller amount of ginseng or a placebo.
8569	11498	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Doctors said that it was too early to recommend that patients take flaxseed or ginseng, though they said the supplements were not harmful.
8570	11499	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Debra L. Barton, an associate professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic and the lead investigator of the ginseng study, cautioned that many ginseng supplements do not use the Wisconsin ginseng used in the study.
8571	11500	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And the quality and quantity of active ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
8572	11501	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The investigators said the mechanisms of action of the flaxseed and the ginseng were not well understood.
8573	11503	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"The theory is ginseng would help the body moderate the negative things going on," she said.
8574	11504	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	In a more conventional study presented here, researchers in Europe found that preventive radiation therapy to the head reduces the risk that tumors will spread to the brain in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
8575	11505	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The treatment also helped patients live longer.
8576	11506	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of all lung cancer cases, but it is an aggressive type.
8577	11507	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Previous studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small area.
8578	11508	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
8579	11510	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That compared with 40.4 percent in a control group.
8580	11511	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Some 27.1 percent of the treated patients were alive a year later, twice as many as the 13.3 percent of the control group.

8590	11529	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
8591	11530	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
8592	11531	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
8593	11532	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
8594	11535	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
8595	11536	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative thinking in some respects.
8596	11537	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
8597	11538	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the next president will confront and is still meeting for the first time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on particular subjects.
8598	11540	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among some Democrats.
8599	11541	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Podhoretz said in an interview published Wednesday in the New York Observer that he recently met with Giuliani to discuss his new book, in which he advocates bombing Iran as part of a larger struggle against "Islamofascism," and "there is very little difference in how he sees the war and I see it."
8600	11543	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said in a recent interview.
8601	11544	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
8602	11545	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
8603	11546	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Yes.
8604	11547	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
8605	11548	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
8606	11550	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
8607	11552	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Elections are necessary but not sufficient to establish genuine democracy," Giuliani wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs, the policy journal.
8608	11553	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their neighbors."
8609	11554	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
8610	11556	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign policy."
8611	11557	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings, contains a number of main elements.
8612	11558	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
8613	11559	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
8614	11560	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to emphasize trade over aid.
8615	11561	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
8616	11563	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with unfriendly countries.
8617	11564	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
8618	11566	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he said.
8619	11567	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"You've got to know with whom to negotiate and with whom you should not negotiate."
8620	11568	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
8621	11570	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.
8622	11572	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
8623	11574	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hill joined a number of prominent foreign policy experts in signing an open letter to Bush urging that "even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack, any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
8624	11575	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."
8625	11576	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He sometimes faults Democrats for failing to mention that the terrorist threat comes specifically from Muslims.
8626	11578	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"America shouldn't be even-handed in dealing with the difference between an elected democracy that's a government ruled by law, and a group of terrorists," he said.
8627	11579	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think that was part of the mistake of the 1990s that led to the debacle that we saw in the Middle East in the way Clinton was handling it."

8630	11583	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	A new study may help quiet fears that the suicide warning labels on antidepressants are scaring countless patients away from medications that could help relieve their suffering.
8631	11584	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The warnings, which were mandated in 2004 by the Food and Drug Administration, say the drugs can increase the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior in some young patients.
8632	11585	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They stirred a fierce debate among psychiatrists, health officials and patient advocates, with critics saying the ruling (and the headlines that accompanied it) went too far.
8633	11586	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the study, which appears Tuesday in The Archives of General Psychiatry, finds that while the warnings appear to have alerted patients and doctors to a possible risk, they have not caused a sharp decline in treatment rates.
8634	11587	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The report is not likely to be the last word on the antidepressant debate, experts said.
8635	11588	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But they added that it provided one of the clearest pictures to date of how patients and doctors behaved in the wake of a controversial decision by drug regulators.
8636	11589	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The researchers analyzed prescription rates from three time periods: May 2002 to June 2003, just before the debate over antidepressant side effects flared

8639	11592	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They found that the rate of Paxil prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased by 44 percent after the 2003 warning on that drug.
8640	11593	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the rate for similar drugs, including Prozac by Eli Lilly, continued to increase in that age group through 2003 and fell off only slightly after the labeling change, in 2005.
8641	11594	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The rate of prescriptions to new patients -- a particular concern for psychiatrists critical of the warnings -- did not change significantly during the warnings or after.
8642	11595	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	Prescription rates to adults increased in the years studied.
8643	11596	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	In sum, the drug agency's warnings seemed to prompt caution rather than panic.

8674	11649	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Bush has asked Congress to hold off on demanding a change in the course of the war until September, when the top U.S. commander, Gen. David Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, delivers a fresh assessment of its progress.
8675	11650	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner and Lugar are well regarded within Congress on defense issues.
8676	11651	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner was the longtime chairman of the Armed Services Committee before stepping down last year, while Lugar is the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
8677	11659	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, both Lugar and Warner expressed grave doubts about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq.
8678	11661	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The legislation would direct Bush to present the new strategy to Congress by Oct. 16 and suggests it be ready for implementation by Dec. 31.
8679	11662	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The proposal also would seek to make Bush renew the authorization for war that Congress gave him in 2002.
8680	11664	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The fast-moving developments capped another stressful week for Bush and administration figures who have been resisting attempts by majority Democrats in Congress to force a U.S. troop withdrawal.
8681	11666	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier Friday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exhorted congressional critics to give the administration and the fledgling government until September to "make a coherent judgment of where we are."
8682	11667	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The day after the House of Representatives voted 223-201 for a Democratic proposal to force a U.S. troop withdrawal by next spring, she acknowledged that al-Maliki's government has not achieved "as much progress as we would like.
8683	11668	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	But we shouldn't just dismiss as inconsequential the progress that they have made."

8685	11670	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Mixon spoke of a troop drawdown that would be smaller and slower than Democrats envision.
8686	11671	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It needs to be well thought out," he said of any plans to drawn down forces.
8687	11672	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It cannot be a strategy that is based on 'Well, we need to leave.'
8688	11673	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	That's not a strategy, that's a withdrawal."

8754	11791	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the military claimed to have inflicted significant casualties on militants in fighting in the past few days in the border region, an insurgent stronghold where top al-Qaida and Taliban leaders are thought to find a haven.
8755	11792	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The battles took place near a military camp in Ladha in South Waziristan between Wednesday and Friday, said army spokesman Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad.
8756	11793	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"The militants suffered heavy casualties, but we cannot give any specific number on their dead," he said, without giving further details.
8757	11794	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The six suspects, one of whom is a retired army major with alleged links to al-Qaida, were arrested in December in raids in different parts of eastern Punjab province.
8758	11795	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The arrests were only made public within the past week.
8759	11797	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We found explosives, suicide belts and maps of military installations" in their hideouts, he said.
8760	11799	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The official said the suspects were "brainwashed" by clerics in the area.
8761	11800	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We learned from them that they wanted to attack the army to avenge the killings of fellow militants," he said.
8762	11801	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"They were convinced that they would go to paradise after sacrificing their life."
8763	11802	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The detained men had been working under Ahsanul Haq, a retired army major with alleged links to al-Qaida.
8764	11805	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	Three other suspects fled, Ahmad said.

8769	11812	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Venezuelans struggle to find milk, chicken, sugar in spite of oil wealth
8770	11814	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The lines formed at dawn and remained long throughout the day -- hundreds upon hundreds of Venezuelans queuing up to buy scarce milk, chicken and sugar at state-run outdoor markets staffed by soldiers in fatigues.
8771	11816	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"You have to get in line and you have to be lucky," said Maria Fernandez, a 64-year-old housewife who was buying milk and chicken on Sunday.
8772	11817	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She said trying to find milk is a constant frustration.
8773	11818	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with the last can.
8774	11819	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The long lines for basic foods at subsidized prices are paradoxical for an oil-rich nation that in many ways is a land of plenty.
8775	11821	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Yet other foods covered by price controls -- eggs, fresh chicken -- periodically are hard to find in supermarkets.
8776	11822	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Fresh milk has become a luxury, and even baby formula is scarcer nowadays.
8777	11823	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for re-election indefinitely.
8778	11825	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
8779	11826	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The government's price controls are also "totally divorced" from reality -- in some cases below production costs -- making it unprofitable for suppliers to sell their products at official prices, said economist Pedro Palma of the Caracas consulting firm MetroEconomica.
8780	11827	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	More investment is needed in agriculture but the government's agrarian reform effort -- assuming control of vast farmlands and offering them to poor farmers -- has made traditional producers reluctant to invest, he said.
8781	11828	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	And importers also face hurdles.
8782	11829	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Currency exchange controls imposed in 2003 by the government require state approval to obtain dollars at the official rate.

8871	11939	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI called Monday for a peace accord in the Middle East, embroiled in a "conflict that has persisted for too long," during his New Year's Day mass at Saint Peter's Basilica.
8872	11940	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Marking World Peace Day, he referred to "the scene of the shepherds of Bethlehem visiting Jesus in the manger," asking: "How can you not look again at the dire situation that characterizes this land where Jesus was born?"

8874	11942	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"A peace accord, to be durable, must rest on respect for dignity and the rights of each person," he urged the Vatican diplomatic corps attending the mass.

8876	11944	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	On December 12 Benedict sent a message to the world's 1.1 billion Catholics ahead of World Peace Day in which he condemned what he called the transformation of religion "into an ideology," and said that "a war in the name of God is never acceptable."

8880	11950	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Jurors deliberated much of Friday evening before convicting Pfc. Jesse Spielman, 22, of conspiracy to commit rape, rape, housebreaking with intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder, despite testimony that cast doubt on his involvement.
8881	11952	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He was charged in connection with the March 12, 2006, rape and slaying of Abeer Qassim al-Janabi and the killings of her family.
8882	11953	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The attack took place in Mahmoudiya, a village about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Baghdad.
8883	11954	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Military prosecutors did not say Spielman took part in the rape or murders, but alleged he went to the house knowing what the others intended to do and served as a lookout.
8884	11955	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman had pleaded guilty on Monday to lesser charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, arson, wrongfully touching a corpse and drinking.
8885	11957	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Soldiers in Spielman's unit fanned the woman with napkins.

8888	11961	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors rested their case Thursday amid struggles to overcome a fellow soldier's recanting of a story that Spielman acted as a lookout during the attack last year.
8889	11962	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spc. James Barker, who has admitted his own role in the assault, said in earlier testimony that he had allowed investigators to draft sworn statements for him that implicated Spielman in the crime.
8890	11963	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker testified Wednesday that several portions of the document were untrue, including references to Spielman's role in the conspiracy to attack the family and his knowledge of plans to rape the girl.
8891	11964	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	But another soldier convicted in the attack, Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, testified that Spielman stood guard as his fellow soldiers raped the girl.

8896	11969	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker and Cortez have given investigators conflicting statements about whether Spielman knew of the plan to rape the girl and was present when they discussed it over swigs from bottles of whiskey and gin mixed with energy drinks, according to testimony.
8897	11970	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	During their courts-martial, Barker and Cortez testified they took turns raping the girl while Green shot and killed her mother, father and younger sister.

8909	11987	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	When Kibaki was declared the winner of the election on December 30 despite mounting evidence of fraud, several tribes turned against the Kikuyus.
8910	11988	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Dozens were speared and hacked to death in raids on villages in the Eldoret area.
8911	11989	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Refugees were also targeted, notably when a church in Eldoret housing displaced Kikuyu families was deliberately set on fire, killing at least 35 people.
8912	11990	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Local residents and observers have argued that in regions where feelings of marginalisation were strongest, tribal vindication was encouraged by campaigns using the long obsolete term of "majimbo".
8913	11991	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Majimbo -- a Kiswahili term which implies a form of federalism, decentralisation and devolution -- featured in Odinga's campaign, although it was never clearly defined.
8914	11992	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Most of the attacks against Kikuyus in the Eldoret area were carried out by Kalenjin, one of the dominant tribes in the area, who squarely supported Odinga and are represented in parliament by his right-hand man William Ruto.
8915	11993	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of the country's tribes rallied behind Odinga, amid resentment at Kibaki and his Kikuyu entourage, seen as an arrogant and corrupt elite.
8916	11994	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Stephen, who was displaced by the deadly violence that followed the elections and now lives in a camp some 20 miles from Eldoret, said that majimbo was understood by some as a license for ethnic cleansing.
8917	11995	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"They did not understand that the term majimbo means sharing of resources and power, brought to people on the ground," he said.
8918	11996	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"According to them, it's cleaning and removing tribes from Kalenjin ancestral land," Stephen added, quivering because of the cold.
8919	11998	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of Eldoret's Kikuyus settled the fertile region after the 1963 independence, with the support of their leader and the country's first president Jomo Kenyatta.

8947	12039	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	General John Craddock, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR), feels "that it's a very natural thing to do, contingency planning, because that's something that a military alliance should be in the regular business of doing," the official said.

9029	12152	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	According to analysts, stripping an official of his party position is usually the prelude to sacking him from his government job.
9030	12153	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been put "under control".
9031	12154	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Since then, several reports have emerged of a systematic cover-up of the extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, involving especially military hospitals in the capital.
9032	12155	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's extensive background within military medicine.
9033	12156	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
9034	12157	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Until 1990 he served in various positions at the PLA's Second Medical University, before becoming deputy director of health at the PLA General Logistics Department until 1993.
9035	12158	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After a series of positions outside the PLA, Zhang was appointed health minister in 1998, as a member of what was considered a more capable and active Cabinet under then-premier Zhu Rongji.
9036	12159	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the spread of AIDS in China.
9037	12160	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.

9069	12206	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	When the Open was last played at Carnoustie, in 1999, the course was famously dubbed Car-nasty by some of the disgruntled players who found the thick rough virtually impossible to deal with.
9070	12207	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	More than half the field ran up at least one round of 80 or higher and unheralded Scot Paul Lawrie finally came through the field to win the tournament with a six-over par four-round total.
9071	12208	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Organisers have attempted to create a fairer test this year with the rough cut back significantly and some subtle changes introduced to take some of the sting out of the holes that caused most problems last time around.
9072	12210	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"On the (par five) sixth the lay-up area was squeezed into 12-15 yards max and remember you are hitting drive and a two iron to lay up where you would be hitting a six or seven iron for your third shot," he recalled.

9094	12243	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	EAST MONTPELIER, Vt.
9095	12244	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of gallons of groundwater flow to the surface in rivulets here each hour, helping to create this town's signature spring, a lush current typical of northern New England.
9096	12246	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The idea makes his neighbors nervous.
9097	12247	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Like two-thirds of Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of East Montpelier depend on wells.
9098	12248	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Some worry that a water-bottling operation will compromise their ability to shower and flush
9099	12249	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	others just do not want their local water sold elsewhere.
9100	12250	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In corners of the state, once-reliable well-water supplies have become intermittent in recent years, with homeowners blaming local developers or mining operations or a bottling operation.
9101	12251	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In March, the town of East Montpelier postponed any bottling for three years.
9102	12252	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in the company of a growing number of states, the legislature adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust.
9103	12253	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Beginning in 2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
9104	12254	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter than Vermont this summer).
9105	12255	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In recent years, eastern aquifers have been drawn down in areas around Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as Atlanta.
9106	12256	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in northern Vermont, last summer during a drought.

9108	12259	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	With the growing recognition that groundwater is not limitless, more states and localities are looking for ways to protect it.
9109	12262	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed in an era of abundance," said Andy Buchsbaum,director of the Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation.

9111	12265	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	We make the assumption that just because you get so many gallons out of a well now, you will forever."
9112	12267	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
9113	12268	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.
9114	12271	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected."
9115	12272	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In the past decade, commercial and industrial users, including golf courses, mining operations and, most notably, water bottlers, have faced increasing local opposition in damp regions from Maine to Wisconsin.

9118	12276	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Early opponents, like farmers, mostly stayed on the sidelines when their water uses were grandfathered under the law.
9119	12277	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Surface water in streams, lakes and rivers, has been legally managed for hundreds of years.
9120	12278	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	But groundwater, until recent years, was often treated as something separate, hydrologically and legally.
9121	12279	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Both distinctions are now breaking down.
9122	12280	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."
9123	12281	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Replenishment from rain or surface water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
9124	12282	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Extraction of ground water tends to alter natural flow patterns and speeds, the report said.
9125	12284	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Mapping a Vermont aquifer and measuring its contents is thus akin to tracing a Jackson Pollock painting -- there are numerous units, of irregular dimensions, to delineate.
9126	12285	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	While some residents of East Montpelier worry that their wells may suffer if Antonovich's firm, Montpelier Springs Water Co., opens for business, Antonovich said that he has had the aquifer mapped and that there is more than enough water for all.
9127	12286	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, he keeps cordial relations with those who oppose him, said Carolyn Shapiro, one of a group of Antonovich's neighbors who pushed for the moratorium.
9128	12287	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the moratorium.
9129	12288	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also typified the debate over the public-trust law.
9130	12289	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Jon Groveman of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, one of the bill's architects, drew praise not only from its legislative sponsors but also from MacLean, who represented the golf course and bottled-water industries.
9131	12290	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
9132	12291	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It is a beginning," she said.
9133	12292	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum said he believes that the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis, or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that the West is now," he said.
9134	12293	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is no water and they're trying to apportion droplets.

9190	12388	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The state's home insurer of last resort told state regulators Friday that a 25 percent increase in its base rate on Cape Cod would be a major step toward covering the company's costs, but added that it is receptive to offering premium reductions to consumers who install hurricane shutters and roof tie-downs or accept higher deductibles.
9191	12389	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Massachusetts Fair Plan's rate request, which follows the approval of a similar-size increase in October, faced near-united opposition from the attorney general, several Cape lawmakers, and a number of homeowners who came from the Cape to testify.
9192	12390	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	They called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic meltdown on the Cape.

9194	12392	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
9195	12393	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Premiums have been rising quickly in those areas because a handful of little-known companies that use computer models to forecast the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes have dramatically raised their damage estimates.
9196	12394	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	These estimates have had a ripple effect throughout the insurance industry.
9197	12395	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Reinsurers, the companies that insure insurance companies against catastrophic events, have raised their rates substantially.
9198	12396	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
9199	12397	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Some companies have decided the risks are too great on the Cape and either reduced their exposure there or walked away, leaving homeowners with no choice for insurance but the Fair Plan.
9200	12398	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
9201	12399	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of them have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the homes on the Cape and islands.
9202	12400	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan, which operates as an independent company but is financially backed by all of the state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
9203	12401	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's current base premium on the Cape is $1,155 and would rise to $1,444 if the pending rate increase is approved.
9204	12402	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's average premium on the Cape is currently $1,500.

9214	12415	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in talks to invest in a wireless company based on WiMax technology, according to a source familiar with the talks.
9215	12416	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The company would be operated by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire, which have focused over the past year on building a network based on WiMax, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.
9216	12417	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	With the new company, the cable providers would be taking direct aim at the nation's biggest wireless carriers, Verizon Communications and AT&amp

9218	12419	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast would invest $1 billion and Time Warner would put as much as $500 million into the venture to create a next-generation, high-speed wireless network spanning the nation, according to the source.
9219	12420	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Sprint declined to comment on speculation about the negotiations.
9220	12422	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Verizon entered into competition with Comcast and Time Warner Cable through its FiOS fiber-optic network, which offers television services.
9221	12423	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"Comcast and Time Warner are home-, broadband- and PC-oriented, so WiMax as a choice to get into wireless makes sense for them," Ask said.
9222	12424	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"But whether or not they should be their own network or lease capacity from Sprint or Clearwire is something for Wall Street analysts to judge."
9223	12425	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Intel and Google are also involved in the discussions about the new venture, according to the source.
9224	12426	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The companies have signaled their interest in joining with Sprint and Clearwire to form a WiMax nationwide network.

9299	12521	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"This law will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on our soil," Bush said as he signed the bill, calling it "vital to the security of our people."
9300	12522	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad while respecting the liberties of Americans here at home," he said.
9301	12523	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White House demand.
9302	12524	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill had sparked fierce debate between civil liberties advocates who argue it eroded checks on the power of government and intelligence officials who feared the row was compromising their power to thwart terror attacks.
9303	12525	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure, after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for telecom firms.
9304	12526	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our midst," Bush said.
9305	12527	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The attack changed our country forever.
9306	12528	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	We realized America was a nation at war.
9307	12529	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Against a ruthless and persistent enemy."
9308	12530	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The president added: "The most important lessons learned after 9/11 was that America's intelligence professionals lack some of the tools they needed to monitor the communications of terrorists abroad.
9309	12531	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's essential that our intelligence committee know who our enemies are talking to, what they're saying, and what they're planning."
9310	12532	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	After the September 11 attacks, Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on calls and emails between the United States and abroad in cases that federal agents deemed may have a terror link.
9311	12533	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The wiretaps went ahead without the permission of a special court set up to watch over government wiretapping operations inside the United States, provided for under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.
9312	12535	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law says the FISA court mechanism is the only way the government can order electronic surveillance of terror suspects.
9313	12536	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The 1978 law allowed the ultra-secretive National Security Agency to wiretap for 72 hours while waiting for the FISA court to approve the action.
9314	12537	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows them to use any information they got even if the FISA court eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.
9315	12538	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	FED, STILL WARY ON INFLATION, LEAVES A KEY RATE UNCHANGED
9316	12539	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
9317	12540	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time.
9318	12541	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
9319	12542	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."
9320	12543	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory.
9321	12544	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated," the central bank said.
9322	12545	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The biggest question was how policymakers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
9323	12546	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	For the past several years, Fed governors including Ben S. Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the "core" rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to 2 percent a year.
9324	12547	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
9325	12548	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
9326	12549	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Fed policymakers are in no rush to reduce interest rates.
9327	12550	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
9328	12551	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.
9329	12552	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.

9332	12557	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Under pressure from global trade rivals, EU nations were expected to push former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions on Tuesday to complete negotiations on new regional free trade pacts by the end of 2007, deals which aid groups fear could lead to more harm than good.
9333	12558	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over 55 trade development ministers from the European Union and its former colonies are to debate how they will meet an end-of- year World Trade Organization deadline to conclude the controversial market-opening trade talks.
9334	12559	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Regional "economic partnership" trade pacts with the 27-nation EU are supposed to be concluded this year, but the talks have been stalled for months due to market access, good governance and aid levels.
9335	12560	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Many of the 78-poor nation grouping known as the ACP group of former European colonies are also loathe to give up over three decades of dependency on privileged access to EU markets.
9336	12563	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ministers and officials were to debate how to provide energy to the poorest nations in Africa, while making sure the electricity they use come from renewable sources.
9337	12564	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz appealed to the EU ministers at informal dinner talks Monday night that the trade pacts go hand in hand with substantial aid to build up key infrastructure like roads and electrical grids, which are critical for an economy to function.
9338	12565	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"What they need right now is more financial assistance, there are many other things as well but you can't build a private sector without electricity and roads," Wolfowitz said.
9339	12566	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The trade accords foresee gradual market openings in parallel with EU funding for good governance and reforms in developing nations so as to spur trade among them.
9340	12567	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Aid groups however, have derided the negotiations saying the deals threaten to undermine poverty reduction.
9341	12568	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Klaus Schilder from aid group World Economy, Ecology and Development, WEED, said the trade pacts on the table "go beyond what is being negotiated" at world trade talks, and include such areas like investment, services and other business sectors which developing countries do not want to include in the talks.
9342	12569	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over the past month EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel held talks with the six regional groupings negotiating trade pacts with the EU.

9355	12590	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
9356	12591	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
9357	12592	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
9358	12593	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss' instruction.
9359	12596	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby has pleaded not guilty, contending he misspoke and forgot about conversations he had with journalists amid the crush of his duties.
9360	12597	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	He is not charged with the leak itself.
9361	12599	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
9362	12600	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
9363	12601	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
9364	12602	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney insisted that the administration had significant evidence that Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
9365	12604	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.
9366	12606	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``As late as last October, the considered judgment of the intel community was that SH (Saddam Hussein) had indeed undertaken a vigorous effort to acquire uranium from Africa, according to NIE (the National Intelligence Estimate),'' she wrote.
9367	12607	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
9368	12610	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby later came to her seat in the back of the plane, holding a handwritten card with notes he said were Cheney's instructions about what to say to Cooper.
9369	12611	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
9370	12612	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
9371	12614	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
9372	12616	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``I did not have a conversation with the vice president about that,'' Martin responded.
9373	12620	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
9374	12623	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
9375	12626	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and radicalization across the region.
9376	12627	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.

9453	12744	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In Hasselbeck they trust Since stepping back in as the Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season, Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
9454	12745	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Completing 61 percent of his passes.
9455	12746	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record 3,966 yards last year.
9456	12747	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
9457	12748	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
9458	12749	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
9459	12750	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
9460	12751	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
9461	12752	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	From the time he arrived in a 2001 trade with the Green Bay Packers, Brett Favre's one-time backup has had a dickens of a time living up to expectations.
9462	12753	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	First, and perhaps foremost, he was coach Mike Holmgren's handpicked passer to replace a couple of local quarterbacks--Jon Kitna, who was not re-signed after the 2000 season
9463	12754	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	and Brock Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him the starter not once but twice in 2000.
9464	12755	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the story of what his first season and a half were like.
9465	12756	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
9466	12757	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won).
9467	12758	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
9468	12759	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were the ineffective and sometimes downright inept efforts when Hasselbeck had to step in for an injured Dilfer in 2002.
9469	12760	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
9470	12761	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson said.
9471	12762	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"He is our leader, and we all need to follow his lead."
9472	12763	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
9473	12764	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck's face and voice are seemingly everywhere.
9474	12765	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In TV commercials for Reebok and Expedia.
9475	12766	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In newspaper ads for Jones Soda.

9479	12770	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
9480	12771	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
9481	12772	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
9482	12773	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"But when I was positive he could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to go, it was actually one of our tough years."
9483	12774	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, in fact, 2002.
9484	12775	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
9485	12776	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
9486	12777	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Twice in the final five games, Hasselbeck gave new meaning to the West Coast offense by setting the franchise record for passing yards--first in San Francisco (427 yards) and then in the season finale in San Diego (449).
9487	12778	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren said.
9488	12779	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"And that's what happened."
9489	12780	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.

9498	12789	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract size was set at 1,000 grams, larger than the originally expected 300 grams, to discourage individual investors who lacked the ability to handle the risk.
9499	12790	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Analysts said they believed investors would need at least 24,000 yuan to secure a futures contract, as most futures brokers would ask for a 12 percent cash deposit for each contract.
9500	12791	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The most active June contract closed the first trading day at 223.3 yuan per gram, up 6.34 percent, with a turnover of 23.2 billion yuan, according to the SFE website.
9501	12792	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The total turnover of the seven contracts was registered at more than 27 billion yuan for the day.

9503	12794	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.

9507	12798	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the launch of gold futures trading.
9508	12799	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
9509	12800	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE, one of China's major futures trading venues, previously traded copper, aluminum, zinc, natural rubber and fuel futures.
9510	12801	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said that gold futures could provide experience for the long- awaited launch of stock index futures.

9513	12805	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said gold futures would improve the country's domestic gold market and pricing mechanism and provide options for financial institutions, gold producers and consumers to protect against market risk.
9514	12806	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also further develop the nascent futures industry.
9515	12809	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	She said, "the contract size could limit participation by individual investors, but in the long run both institutions and individuals would play an equal role."
9516	12811	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.

9518	12814	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, the regulators were trying to discourage such clients, fearing that some might take on risks they couldn't handle.
9519	12815	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE said earlier that it would impose strict risk controls on gold futures.
9520	12816	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also set a minimum margin requirement of 7 percent of the contract value.
9521	12817	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
9522	12818	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, CSRC said individuals would be barred from taking physical delivery of gold in futures trading and could buy bullion only from banks or the spot market.

9531	12831	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Trade at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the country's spot market, was 1,828 tons last year, with a total value of 316.5 billion yuan.
9532	12832	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Based on that figure, Zheng said, the futures market could hit 10.5 trillion yuan, because international experience showed that futures trade was usually 33 times spot trade.
9533	12833	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The estimated figure would exceed the combined market capitalization of the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

9536	12837	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A group of family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outraged by city plans to move the commemoration ceremony, filed a request Wednesday asking to hold the annual event at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.
9537	12838	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The coalition filed the request with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site.
9538	12839	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The agency says construction at the site would make a ceremony there unsafe, but family members plan to sue if they are denied.
9539	12840	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"This is the place we have.
9540	12841	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A precedent has been set in letting us touch ground zero," said Diane Horning, a representative of one of the family groups.
9541	12842	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Rosaleen Tallon, of Advocates for a 9/11 Fallen Heroes Memorial, said remains of people killed in the 2001 terror attack are still being found at the site.
9542	12843	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"How can we possibly not go there to memorialize these people?"
9543	12844	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	she said.
9544	12845	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It is still their resting place, and I want to be there."
9545	12846	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The city has said that ground zero, now undergoing reconstruction, is not safe for the large annual gathering, and it plans to move the recitation of names to a nearby plaza.
9546	12848	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It's just not safe," Bloomberg said.
9547	12849	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"Listen, we've had enough tragedy on that site.
9548	12850	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Our first priority, No. 1, is to make sure that everybody's safe, and nothing's going to get us off that."
9549	12851	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Attorney Norman Siegel, who is representing the families, said that if the Port Authority rejects the permit, the families would consider a federal lawsuit on First Amendment grounds.
9550	12852	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	He said the groups had gotten consultations on safety and security and that the site would be safe as long as the construction was halted the day of the ceremony.
9551	12854	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"As an agency that lost 84 friends and colleagues on September 11, the Port Authority is sensitive to the needs of those who lost loved ones," he said.
9552	12855	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"We are actively looking at ways to accommodate family members who want to pay their respects on the World Trade Center site on 9/11, but the substantial construction activity and current site conditions will not allow the formal ceremony to be safely conducted on the site."
9553	12857	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The roll call stops only for moments of silence at the times the two planes hit and the twin towers collapsed.
9554	12858	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	During the reading, and throughout the rest of the day, families have had access to the seven-story pit that was once the basement of the twin towers, where they would lay flowers.
9555	12859	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg said family members will be able to leave flowers in an area along the southern edge of the site, but they will not be allowed into the pit.
9556	12860	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"There isn't a place to do that anymore, unfortunately, and next year there will be even less," he said.
9557	12861	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"The next time you'll be able to have a ceremony on the site is really when we complete the memorial."
9558	12862	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Construction on the memorial began last year, and it is expected to open in 2009.

9582	12892	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has a reputation for doing whatever it takes to cajole companies to invest here in his home state, from giving movie producers his private phone number to building a special water-treatment plant for a cheese company.
9583	12893	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a handshake.
9584	12895	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We would set it up and he would close it."
9585	12897	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The governor has created a thriving film industry here from scratch and has nurtured a fledgling solar-energy sector, mostly through tax breaks for investors.
9586	12898	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He has also persuaded several light manufacturers to set up shop, attracted investments from high-tech companies, built a commuter railroad and transformed a sleepy border crossing into a transportation hub to increase trade with Mexico.
9587	12899	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	In perhaps his biggest gamble, Richardson has procured financing for a spaceport in southern New Mexico, called Spaceport America, from which he envisions tourists departing on cruises beyond the atmosphere.
9588	12901	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's not one to spend a lot of time on small projects."
9589	12902	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	It remains to be seen whether Richardson can do something similar on the national level.
9590	12903	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he wants his commerce secretary to play a pivotal role in salvaging the economy, and aides to Richardson say they expect that he will try to expand the traditional role of the office.
9591	12904	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to elevate this office to a level of importance that it genuinely deserves during this economic crisis," said Homans, who is the state tax commissioner.
9592	12905	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to be, in some respects, reinventing the Department of Commerce."
9593	12906	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Richardson said at a news conference here on Thursday that he would apply to the national economy some of the same principles he used to create jobs in New Mexico.
9594	12907	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Obviously," he said, "we need to rebuild America's economy, domestically and internationally, create jobs and get ourselves out of this stagnant situation."
9595	12908	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But economists and political opponents point out that Richardson has benefited from record-high oil and natural gas prices during his tenure as governor.
9596	12909	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	As a result, state coffers were overflowing with revenue from taxes on oil and gas production.
9597	12910	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
9598	12912	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Economists say that job growth, too, owed a lot to the boom in the oil and natural gas fields.
9599	12913	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	With the price of oil plummeting, the growth in jobs has leveled off here and a projected $500 million shortfall has opened up in the state budget.
9600	12914	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Still, no one doubts the state would be worse off in the current recession had it not been for Richardson's success in attracting investment and creating jobs.
9601	12915	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Business leaders whom Richardson has wooed say he is a tough negotiator, hard to resist one on one.
9602	12917	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It was the only time I've ever been given a presidential candidate's cell phone number by a presidential candidate," Fine said.
9603	12919	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	After they went over the fine points of the agreement, Richardson, a physically imposing man, suddenly stood and reached a big hand over the table and asked, "Do we have a deal?"
9604	12920	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Ungeheuer was taken aback, but a few seconds later shook on it, according to people who were present.
9605	12921	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"The way the deal was sealed was with a handshake, and he made sure he got that handshake before he left the room," said Fine, still sounding somewhat incredulous.
9606	12922	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We built a plant in New Mexico on the basis of a handshake."
9607	12923	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Some of Richardson's detractors, however, say he can be overbearing and vicious when he does not get his way.
9608	12924	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He enjoys the limelight that comes from his visionary pronouncements, they say, and he is impatient with opponents.
9609	12925	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It's his way or the highway," said the state Senate president pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat who has clashed with the governor over spending.
9610	12926	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Anyone who dares to differ with him, he doesn't take very well."
9611	12927	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the growth of the film industry in New Mexico attests to Richardson's skills as a salesman and deal-closer.
9612	12928	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Shortly after taking office in 2003, the governor went to Hollywood to meet with the heads of major studios.

9682	13033	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
9683	13034	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather, died of cancer in August 2006.
9684	13035	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was always going to be a difficult hurdle for me to get back into the winner's enclosure after Heather passed away... It's a big mental hurdle that I have crossed today," the 39-year-old said.
9685	13036	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as his thoughts drifted to his family.

9687	13040	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
9688	13041	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said it was the most important victory of his career as it cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.

9690	13043	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's not easy to see through," Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has endured since his wife died.
9691	13044	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	In that respect, Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons, aged nine and seven.
9692	13045	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"This win is for Tyrone and Conor," he said, while also thanking all his friends who had supported him over the past 20 months.
9693	13046	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke, who for many years had been a mainstay in Europe's Ryder Cup team, had watched his world ranking plummet out of the top 50 to 236 at the start of the BMW Asian Open.
9694	13047	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said his win on Sunday was the result of practising 10-12 hours a day.
9695	13048	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"I've been working harder than I've ever worked on all aspects of my game.
9696	13049	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's nice to see it pay off," he said.
9697	13051	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	However Clarke missed a par putt of less than two feet on the 16th, then bogeyed the 17th after driving into the trees to allow Derksen a share of the lead.
9698	13052	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"From the the 14th onwards.
9699	13053	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I lost my concentration.
9700	13054	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I started thinking about Heather and the boys and bits and pieces," Clarke said.
9701	13055	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"In this game, unless you keep your concentration for the whole way around, you make mistakes and that's what I did."
9702	13056	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	On the 18th, Derksen chipped his third shot to within two feet to be almost assured of a par.
9703	13057	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	That left Clarke with his putt of nearly 30 feet to win the tournament or face going into a playoff with Derksen.
9704	13058	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"On the last green I gathered myself and said: 'Right, hit a good putt'.
9705	13059	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Luckily I did," a beaming Clarke said.
9706	13060	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Derksen paid tribute to Clarke afterwards.
9707	13061	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Darren doled a good putt and that's his day," said Derksen, who was bidding for his third win on the European Tour.
9708	13062	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was a great match... He's a great winner."
9709	13063	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke said he would now strive to return to the world's top 50 and get his place back in Europe's Ryder Cup team.

9735	13095	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Three weeks ago he was laid off and his employer and government officials have denied him required unemployment and medical insurance, he said.
9736	13096	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We have been cheated.
9737	13098	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The shabby office is packed with jobless workers checking job advertisements offering 1,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan (about 175 to 370 dollars) -- about 50 percent less than earlier this year, Gao said.
9738	13099	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"None of the jobs pay enough.
9739	13100	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We're abandoned," he said.
9740	13101	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The ILO's Thomas said China was ramping up re-training programmes and addressing holes in the social safety net.

9742	13103	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But far more is needed, given the problem's scale, she said.
9743	13104	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, many workers are giving up and heading home, according to statistics showing increased rail traffic from manufacturing regions.

9748	13109	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats passes short-term spending bill but differences remain
9749	13111	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Congressional Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a bill to keep the U.S. government open for another week as lawmakers fashioned an omnibus spending bill and sought agreement among themselves and with the White House.
9750	13112	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The House passed the short-term funding bill by a 385-27 vote
9751	13114	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments whose budgets have yet to pass.
9752	13115	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It is expected the omnibus measure will pass by then, allowing Congress to finally adjourn for the year.
9753	13117	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of the politically sacrosanct program.
9754	13118	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But Democrats had yet to resolve differences among themselves, much less with the White House.
9755	13119	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Differences over Iraq and whether to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still to be resolved.
9756	13123	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
9757	13126	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The issue of Iraq has yet to be resolved, though expectations were growing that Senate Democrats would relent and allow Republicans to provide up to $70 billion (euro47.6 billion) in new war funds to the measure, without restrictions that have provoked Bush veto threats, such as a December 2008 target date for withdrawing combat troops.
9758	13128	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps months of wrangling.
9759	13129	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23 billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the funding to increases for domestic programs such as health research, education, grants to state and local governments and energy research.
9760	13131	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat Saturday.
9761	13133	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The measure would fund every Cabinet department except the Pentagon.
9762	13134	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Under Bush's budget, domestic Cabinet departments other than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would see their budgets frozen.
9763	13135	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Considering inflation and population gains, that means most programs would not be able to deliver a comparable level of services next year as they do now.

9820	13205	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	New Mortgage Rule Aims to Close an Interest Rate Gap
9821	13206	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
9822	13207	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37, a legal secretary.
9823	13208	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
9824	13209	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
9825	13211	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
9826	13212	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rattled investors stopped buying them.
9827	13213	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
9828	13214	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
9829	13215	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 for single-family homes.
9830	13216	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
9831	13217	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The amount would vary so that the most expensive areas would qualify for bigger loans.
9832	13218	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
9833	13219	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
9834	13220	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
9835	13221	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the only ones investors are buying these days, which is why policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
9836	13222	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
9837	13223	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
9838	13225	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	A lot of the details have not yet been determined.
9839	13226	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
9840	13227	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
9841	13228	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of calculating the limits
9842	13229	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	it's expected to tell lenders next month what the limits are in various areas.
9843	13230	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
9844	13231	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
9845	13232	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts.
9846	13233	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of the region they will use.
9847	13234	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the Stanford Group Company, a policy research firm in Washington, estimated that if the cap is based on median prices compiled by the National Association of Realtors, locally it would be about $500,000 and would apply to an area that extends into West Virginia.
9848	13236	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
9849	13237	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lower rates would help Galloway, the Charles County homeowner.
9850	13238	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
9851	13239	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She has an adjustable-rate mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly to a higher level.
9852	13240	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
9853	13241	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
9854	13242	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
9855	13243	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
9856	13244	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
9857	13245	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
9858	13246	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
9859	13248	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The perceived risk is not a creditworthiness issue, Rajadhyaksha said.
9860	13249	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rather, it's the jumbo borrowers' well-documented fondness for refinancing when rates drop, which forces investors to reinvest the money at a lower rate.
9861	13250	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
9862	13251	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
9863	13252	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75.
9864	13253	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."
9865	13254	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
9866	13255	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But even if rates drop, not everyone will be able to take advantage of them, Retsinas said.
9867	13256	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

9869	13258	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	REUNION, Florida 2007-05-21 21:48:54 UTC
9870	13259	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Gymnastics judges would no longer answer to officials in their own countries under the latest effort to remove politics from the sport.
9871	13261	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The pool could be in place by 2010 or 2011.
9872	13262	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"It is the last war I have against everybody," Grandi, speaking mostly through an interpreter, said in a 90-minute interview after the federation's annual meeting in Orlando.
9873	13263	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"If the people understand that it's only in the interest of gymnastics, in two or three years we solve another big problem."
9874	13264	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation -- or FIG -- already uses a judges pool for rhythmic gymnastics.
9875	13265	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi led the charge to revamp the sport's traditional 10-point scale to an open-ended scoring system, which is supposed to give a truer representation of routine's value.
9876	13266	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The system has been in use since the beginning of 2006, and will get its biggest test at the Beijing Olympics next year.
9877	13267	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The change came after a series of judging errors at the Athens Olympics, most notably the debacle involving all-around champion Paul Hamm.
9878	13269	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Yang finished third, 0.049 points behind Hamm.
9879	13270	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi's suggestion that Hamm share his gold medal fueled protests by the South Koreans that forced the American to defend himself all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
9880	13271	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Hamm eventually was declared the rightful winner, and Grandi said again Monday he agreed with that decision.
9881	13272	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"Paul Hamm is the Olympic champion without any ifs or buts," Grandi said.
9882	13273	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	But the Hamm incident wasn't the only reason gymnastics had to change its rules, Grandi said.
9883	13274	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	There also were problems with the men's high bar and vault competitions in Athens.
9884	13275	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi also expressed concern that some don't fully understand the new points system, wrongly believing that more difficult routines are rewarded even if performed incorrectly.
9885	13276	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"The big problem we're having lately is that we have to penalize very strongly execution mistakes or lack of artistry," he said.
9886	13277	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"This is the big philosophy I want to get through.
9887	13278	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	You should win if you have high difficulty, but only if it is executed perfectly.
9888	13279	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	If not, the deductions should be so strong that it's worse to do the more difficult thing."
9889	13280	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Execution penalties are already higher than under the old system -- eight-tenths of a point, compared to a half-point -- but Grandi said he'd like to see them doubled.
9890	13281	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation has also held classes to make sure judges understand the new rules, and is using video replay so judges can review routines.
9891	13282	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"I intend for the Olympic Games to make sure the judges will apply the rules correctly," Grandi said.

9916	13316	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Quite appropriately, Benedict XVI seeks the respect of the world as leader of more than a billion Catholics.
9917	13317	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	He behaves, however, as if he were running an exclusive club with no need to consider the sensibilities or intelligence of that world.
9918	13318	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."
9919	13321	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	John Paul called Jews his "elder brothers" in the faith.

10048	13509	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening its belt.
10049	13510	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better- tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving some consumers with less discretionary income.
10050	13512	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to reflect the tough economy."
10051	13513	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said second quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7 million, from $150.8 million a year earlier, while per-share earnings declined 21 percent, to 15 cents, from 19 cents.
10052	13514	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
10053	13515	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company said revenue rose 12 percent, to $2.5 billion.
10054	13516	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than- expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic environment as the weakest in the company's history.
10055	13517	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Wall Street analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
10056	13519	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
10057	13520	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
10058	13521	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbuck's shares.
10059	13522	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The stock, which fell 11 percent after the company's warning last week, rose 3 cents, to $16.23 a share, in regular trading.
10060	13524	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
10061	13525	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue.
10062	13526	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.
10063	13527	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
10064	13528	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"There are no sacred cows."
10065	13529	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020 stores this year, down from its previous target of 1,175, and to open fewer than 400 stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
10066	13530	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
10067	13531	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
10068	13532	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to $800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011.
10069	13533	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
10070	13534	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
10071	13535	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service.
10072	13536	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company also announced three new cold beverages.
10073	13537	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures.
10074	13538	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company expects revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent this year.
10075	13539	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.

10101	13579	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	Samsonov, who has never claimed a world championship but won three European top honors and two World Cups, saw a possible turning point in the third set as he earned three set point on 10-7 and denied Wang's late comeback to win it 15-13.
10102	13580	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	The former leading one in Europe's "Good Time", however, has been ousted from the main group of world top class table tennis, succumbed to the world number one Chinese 11-9, 11-5, 13-15, 11-9, 11-7.

10105	13584	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-01-30 18:29:42 UTC
10106	13585	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Eiffel Tower's 20,000 flashing light bulbs will go dark for five minutes on Thursday evening, hours before scientists and officials publish a long-awaited report about global warming.
10107	13586	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
10108	13587	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a report laying out policy proposals for governments based on the latest research on global warming.
10109	13590	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"There's a lot of momentum that has being building," Nuttall said.
10110	13591	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"We have a window of opportunity."
10111	13592	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Nuttall said the summit could be held between July and December.
10112	13593	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the conference's host.
10113	13594	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries that marked previous reports.
10114	13595	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report must be unanimously approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can challenge the scientists' wording.
10115	13597	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
10116	13599	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Another observer who has taken part in several such conferences, Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace, said, "So far we're running on timetable.
10117	13600	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	But who knows, we've got two more days.
10118	13601	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	If there's any panic, it will be Wednesday night when they realize they've only got a few hours left."
10119	13602	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and sea levels this century.
10120	13603	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report "won't change our scientific basis, but it will make our jobs easier," Steve Sawyer, of Greenpeace, said Tuesday.
10121	13604	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"It is an important and powerful new tool in public debate and policy debate."
10122	13605	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups have long urged governments and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power instead of greenhouse gas-emitting ones like coal and oil.
10123	13606	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Greenhouse gases are considered a key culprit of rising global temperatures.

10128	13613	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The good news is that this is 0.1 percent lower than the CPI- Food reported in December 2007 that showed a year-on-year increase of 13.5 percent," he said.
10129	13614	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Food categories making the largest contribution to this increase include grain products, milk, cheese and eggs, fats and oils, fruits and nuts and vegetables.
10130	13615	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Staple food items continue to increase at a relatively high rate.
10131	13616	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Brown bread increased at 16.21 percent and white bread at 19.
10132	13617	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	92 percent year-on-year.
10133	13618	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The prices of a 5-kg bag of super and special maize meal increased by 22.29 percent and 28.00 percent respectively, year- on- year.
10134	13619	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The price of diary products on average increased by about a third, and vegetable products by just over a third.
10135	13620	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other food products.
10136	13621	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events," said Pieter.
10137	13622	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity prices would remain high but stable.
10138	13623	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this situation however.
10139	13624	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Consumers were becoming risk averse because of pessimism around economic growth.
10140	13625	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food was expected to decline.
10141	13626	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Pieter said the steep rise in food prices could potentially decelerate.
10142	13627	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure, favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and livestock markets.

10146	13634	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the official results can only be declared after it rules on petitions lodged by Musharraf's opponents that his candidacy is unconstitutional.

10148	13636	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	A nonprofit group has started briefing departments and agencies on the importance of properly "onboarding" new employees, after releasing a report showing that the government and new employees could benefit from well-run orientations.
10149	13637	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
10150	13638	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.
10151	13640	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	"There's some set of folks that are leaving because it was not a good fit, but you can also infer that there are some who are leaving because they were not effectively engaged by their employer," he said.

10162	13661	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video shows an instructor and a soldier in camouflage uniforms in a forest.

10496	14090	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Alice (Carla Ribas), who works in a beauty parlor, is at the center of it all, living with her mother, who's slowly going blind
10497	14091	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	a philandering husband
10498	14092	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	and three sons.
10499	14093	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	One son is a soldier by day and a male prostitute by night, another steals from grandma and the angelic youngest sits around in teen mopiness.
10500	14094	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	When Alice decides to take up with an old flame, who's also married, the insanity level of the household reaches fever pitch.
10501	14095	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Yes, we seem to be watching all the secrets, unmet aspirations, hatred, bitterness and frustration that we can cram under one roof.
10502	14096	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	But "Alice's House" isn't pitched as family farce or even soap opera.
10503	14097	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	It's more of a naturalistic tableau of humans trying to negotiate the twists and turns of life with their own desperations and inadequacies.
10504	14098	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	Even though it sounds awfully depressing, there's something moving about watching people go at their lives with everything they have -- or don't have.
10505	14099	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	As Alice, Ribas has wowed international film festival juries, winning several awards.
10506	14100	LTW_ENG_20080411.0040.LDC2009T13	She'll wow you, too, with her character's aching vulnerabilities as all of Sao Paulo seems to sag heavily on her shoulders.

10512	14106	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES
10513	14107	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	On a positive note, the Dodgers won't have to experience a home opener the rest of the season.
10514	14108	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may not spare them outfielders being eaten up by the expanded, all-color advertising/scoreboard walls, or pitchers limping off the field because they didn't down enough sports drink, but at least they won't have to suffer any more ignoble openers.
10515	14109	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kids skipped school for this.
10516	14110	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Lawyers emptied downtown glass skyscrapers and billed phony hours for this.
10517	14111	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	People fibbed and played hooky, and a few even legitimately took the day off for this.
10518	14113	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	A local celebration.
10519	14114	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers and a weekday afternoon home opener.
10520	14115	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Only the Dodgers looked flat, lost the game 6-3 to the Rockies, lost two of their starting nine to injury and momentarily lost the momentum built after sweeping the evil Giants up north.
10521	14116	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Hey, but it was sunny and reasonably warm and the new parking scheme didn't turn into Chavez Ravine road rage and they still served Dodger Dogs.
10522	14117	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, on to the next one.
10523	14118	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers never led this one, and the game was pretty much devoid of dramatics.
10524	14119	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	They almost seemed to treat the opener as this little requirement that had to be dealt with before moving on to other things, like the other 80 home games.
10525	14120	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There was plenty of pregame pomp and festivities, but in the end a lot of bunting left hanging around another loss.
10526	14121	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"We're glad it's over with," said Dodgers manager Grady Little.
10527	14122	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Mostly Little was glad the initial medical reports on outfielder Matt Kemp and right-hander Jason Schmidt were less than frightening.
10528	14123	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Little said before the game that Kemp and Andre Ethier were not in an official platoon in right field, but in competition for the full-time job.
10529	14124	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Some competitions last longer than others.
10530	14125	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp has been off to a solid start, but in the fourth inning he chased a drive by Jeff Baker to the wall in right.
10531	14126	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The drive hit the wall at about the same time as Kemp.
10532	14127	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	This is a new wall, one that oddly doubles as a scoreboard, or streamlined video board.
10533	14128	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The video board is about double the size of last season's out-of- town scoreboard.
10534	14129	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's filled with stats and advertising, like the promise of "Oceans 13" coming June 8, or about the time I normally write off the Dodgers.
10535	14130	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's covered in plexiglass, which supposedly gives, but apparently not too much.
10536	14131	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit an area that would have been padded last year -- the padding added years ago after Darryl Strawberry separated his shoulder crashing into the wall.
10537	14132	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I got hops like Jordan, I jumped so high," Kemp said.
10538	14133	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit the video wall with his right shoulder and fell in a clump.
10539	14134	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Pain flashed through his shoulder and he feared serious injury.
10540	14135	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"At first I thought it was worse than it was," he said.
10541	14136	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp left the game and was taken to a local hospital for X-rays.
10542	14137	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Seasons had gotten off to better starts.
10543	14138	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	New Dodgers trainer, and former Giants trainer, Stan "No Relation" Conte said X-rays were negative, revealing no fractures or apparent dislocation, but more would be known today.
10544	14139	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers veteran second baseman Jeff Kent remained understandably skeptical about the logic of a video-board outfield wall.
10545	14140	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about that," Kent said.
10546	14141	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"Plexiglass?
10547	14142	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may have to go.
10548	14143	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't think guys are going to want to climb that."
10549	14144	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Then in the top of the fifth, Nomar Garciaparra bobbled a Kazuo Matsui grounder for an error.
10550	14145	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, covering first, immediately grabbed the back of his right hamstring after hitting the bag.
10551	14146	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodger hearts dropped.
10552	14147	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, the Dodgers' $47 million offseason acquisition, also left the game, though Conte later said the right-hander was simply dehydrated and cramped.
10553	14148	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is expected to make his next start.
10554	14149	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"He'll be fine," Little said.
10555	14150	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt both allowed and received his first Dodger home runs in the opener.
10556	14151	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	He gave up a first-inning home run to Garrett Atkins, but then provided the Dodgers with their only power of the day, hitting a solo shot off Jeff Francis in the third.
10557	14152	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It was that kind of goofy, not-quite-together opener.
10558	14153	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Things got off to a less than auspicious start when the two F-16s from Edwards Air Force Base that were supposed to fly over as the climax of the opening ceremony flew over Dodger Stadium before the anthem was even sung.
10559	14154	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers took the field with Wilson Valdez at shortstop for the injured Rafael Furcal and Ramon Martinez at third for Wilson Betemit.
10560	14155	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Betemit is healthy but erratic, and that Dodgers commitment to him at third lasted a whole five games.
10561	14156	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There were several small moments to make the Dodger faithful nervous -- Juan Pierre unable to throw a runner out at the plate on a ball so shallow Kent almost could have gotten there
10562	14158	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	a pair of errors
10563	14159	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	the middle of the lineup going 1 for 12.
10564	14160	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The crowd mostly sat quietly throughout all this, save for the nearly traditional fan running across the field in the eighth and being gang-tackled by security.
10565	14161	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Still, it was one game.
10566	14162	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers had also lost their season opener at Milwaukee.
10567	14163	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	For now at least, this messy opener business was behind them.
10568	14164	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	For openers, better games await.
10569	14165	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	IMF set to cut up to 15 percent of staff in overhaul
10570	14166	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The International Monetary Fund announced plans Friday to cut up to 15 percent of its staff in a wide-ranging overhaul aimed at shoring up finances at the multilateral economic institution.
10571	14167	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In comments posted in an internal IMF magazine, the organization said the planned overhaul aimed at budget savings of around 100 million dollars annually and possible job losses of between 300 and 400 staff.
10572	14168	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Such cuts could affect around 15 percent of the IMF's total headcount of 2,600.
10573	14169	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	An IMF official, who requested anonymity, told AFP the job cuts would likely occur over three years starting on May 1, 2008.
10574	14170	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The jobs losses, if implemented, would rank among the largest in the IMF's history.
10575	14171	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Prior job cuts have been small by comparison involving considerably less than 100 employees.
10576	14173	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Strauss-Kahn said the overhaul is key to refocusing the IMF's operations and his bid to introduce a new and stronger income model for the 185-country institution.
10577	14174	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Without quickly reforming its operations and cutting jobs, the IMF could face a funding shortfall of 400 million dollars by 2010, the magazine article, which was posted on the IMF's website, warned.
10578	14175	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The Standard &amp
10579	14176	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Poor's credit rating agency said in a recent report that the IMF is burning up its cash reserves so fast it risks hindering its ability to help countries in need.
10580	14177	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The Washington-based IMF, seen as a lender of last resort to impoverished and developing countries, lost about 110 million dollars in its fiscal year ended April 30, but the S&amp
10581	14178	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	P cautioned that such losses could double if it does not address its operations.
10582	14179	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	An internal IMF group advising the organization has recommended that the fund sell some of its valuable gold reserves and invest the proceeds in income- generating assets in a bid to improve its financial stance.
10583	14180	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The overhaul comes as the IMF faces challenges over its survival.
10584	14181	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Many developing nations are growing rapidly and as a result have less need for IMF aid which is often granted with strict standards.
10585	14182	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Friday, the straight- talking Kahn said: "This institution works well, with dedicated people and very high-level staff, but it is a factory to produce paper."
10586	14183	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In the IMF magazine, the IMF chief was quoted as saying "the coming months will inevitably be a period of rapid change."

10589	14188	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The rest of the 82 flights canceled Wednesday were for destinations in Germany and Europe.

10594	14197	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The first day of strikes had little effect on the Cologne-based airline's flights, but approximately 70 flights were canceled Tuesday.
10595	14198	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The union is seeking a 9.8 percent pay rise for a year, while the airline has offered 7.7 percent for 21 months including a one- time bonus payment.
10596	14199	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Gemkow said the union and airline were not in discussions currently.
10597	14200	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The union isn't ready to talk to us at the moment," he said.
10598	14202	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The strike is damaging air transport, tourism, logistics and the whole economy -- and that in a phase in which economic signals are in any case pointing downward," Werner Schnappauf said in a statement.
10599	14204	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	He said that, for instance, both Lufthansa Technik, the company's aircraft maintenance and repair business, and catering unit LSG SkyChefs usually do a lot of work for airlines other than Lufthansa, but that extra revenue was not coming in from outside customers during the strike.

10605	14211	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The International Rugby Board (IRB) Council said Thursday it had approved a global trial of Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) designed to reduce the number of turnover situations in a match for a 12-month period starting on August 1, 2008.
10606	14213	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The new rules were introduced on an experimental basis in approved tournaments around the world since 2006 and now will be rolled out in the northern hemisphere, the IRB said in a statement.
10607	14214	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	"The Council's decision to implement a global trial of Experimental Law Variations represents an important milestone for the future of the Game.
10608	14215	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	It vindicates the process that was adopted by Council in 2004 for future Law amendments.
10609	14217	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The ELVs are essentially designed to help promote more ball in play and attractive free-flowing rugby and have already been trialled in the southern hemisphere.
10610	14218	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB added it had agreed that ELVs concerning sanctions not already approved for global trials would be further trialled in a selected elite Northern Hemisphere competition in the 2008/09 season.

10612	14221	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The rule changes came after a laws study group was tasked with suggesting changes to speed up the game while reducing the influence of penalty-kicks which would in future only result from foul play and offside.

10615	14224	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	CONCORD, N.C.
10616	14225	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Jeff Gordon has little to prove in a career that has left him among the best drivers to have ever competed in NASCAR.
10617	14226	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has four Cup championships, and his legacy is already secure.
10618	14227	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That does not stop him from pushing for more.
10619	14228	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing that says I need to do this or I need to do that, or I haven't done this and so this is what's left," Gordon said Thursday as he prepared for the Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
10620	14229	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm just trying to be competitive and continue to get that great feeling of what it's like to win races and battle for championships and hope that we've got what it takes to do it."
10621	14230	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	So far, he still does.
10622	14232	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish, Gordon then held off Clint Bowyer to take the checkered flag for his second consecutive victory.
10623	14233	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He also took control of the playoff chase.
10624	14234	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has a 68-point lead on his teammate Jimmie Johnson, who finished 14th, and a 78-point on Bowyer, who finished second as he continues to assert himself in the playoff.
10625	14235	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	With five races to go in the Chase, they are the only three drivers with a realistic shot at winning the title.
10626	14236	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon came into the race in a slump at Lowe's, having failed to finish each of his last five races here dating back to 2005.
10627	14237	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, Johnson came into the race with five victories at Lowe's and an air of invincibility here.
10628	14238	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Johnson experienced a rare spin-out with 104 laps to go and fell to 30th, before climbing back.
10629	14239	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"This is what we were looking for, getting a win at Charlotte," Gordon said as he celebrated in victory lane.
10630	14240	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the final laps, Gordon had a comfortable lead on Kyle Busch, his Hendrick Motorsports teammate when the race was red-flagged for a little more than 12 minutes after a late crash left oil on the track.
10631	14241	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
10632	14243	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
10633	14244	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the playoff chase into a one-man race.
10634	14245	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He dominated through the first 200 laps of the event.
10635	14246	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But a long stay on pit road to replace a part dropped him down to 16th place with just over 120 laps to go.
10636	14247	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson appeared on his way up the field when he spun out.
10637	14248	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.
10638	14249	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who won his first title last year, can become the first driver since Gordon to win back-to-back championships in the Cup series since Gordon pulled off that feat in 1997-98.
10639	14250	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	It appears the two-time champion Tony Stewart will not be a threat.
10640	14251	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of the race.
10641	14252	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Stewart's No. 20 Chevrolet sustained damage on the right front and he dropped back to 28th.
10642	14253	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Although Stewart finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.
10643	14258	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	Browne said he recognized the dilemma faced by the Royal Navy over its decision to allow the sailors among the 15 hostages to take payment in return for their accounts.
10644	14259	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	Everyone recognized it had "not reached a satisfactory outcome" and ordered the ban, he said.
10645	14260	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	"I want to be sure those charged with these difficult decisions have clear guidance for the future," he said.
10646	14261	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	"Until that time, no further service personnel will be allowed to talk to the media about their experiences in return for payment."
10647	14262	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	A review of procedures has been ordered by the Ministry of Defense.
10648	14263	XIN_ENG_20070409.0245.LDC2009T13	Leading Seaman Faye Turney and some of her colleagues have been selling their stories to newspapers and televisions.

10653	14272	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The quake injured more than 260 people, flattened dozens of wooden buildings and triggered a fire at a nuclear power plant.
10654	14273	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Fire sirens could be heard in hard-hit Kashiwazaki city, and older buildings were reduced to piles of lumber.
10655	14274	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	National broadcaster NHK reported more than 260 people were hurt, with injuries including broken bones, cuts and bruises.
10656	14275	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Two women in Kashiwazaki died, an official at Kashiwazaki Central Hospital said on condition of anonymity, citing hospital protocol.
10657	14276	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	NHK reported that the women were in their 80s and had been buried in separate buildings.
10658	14277	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	"I was so scared -- the violent shaking went on for 20 seconds," Ritei Wakatsuki, an employee of convenience store Lawson, told The Associated Press by telephone from Kashiwazaki.
10659	14278	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	"I almost fainted by the fear of shaking."
10660	14279	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Flames and billows of black smoke poured from the Kashiwazaki nuclear plant, which automatically shut down during the quake.
10661	14281	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Some 440 people were evacuated from the quake zone, NHK reported.
10662	14282	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The force of the quake buckled seaside roads and bridges, and one-meter (yard) wide fissures could been seen in the ground along the coastline.
10663	14283	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	One of two people buried under a collapsed apartment house had been rescued, though the person's condition was unknown, police said.
10664	14284	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Separately, TV footage showed rescue workers and firefighters hacking at the roof of a damaged home searching for anyone trapped within.
10665	14285	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	A ceiling collapsed in a gym in Kashiwazaki where about 200 people had gathered for a badminton tournament, and one person suffered minor facial injuries, Kyodo reported.
10666	14286	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The quake also knocked a train car off the rails while it was stopped at a station.
10667	14287	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	No one was injured.
10668	14288	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings along the coast of Niigata prefecture (state), but the warnings were later lifted.
10669	14289	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Waves as high as 50 centimeters (20 inches) were believed to have hit the coast, but no damage was reported.
10670	14292	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The agency initially measured the quake at a 6.6 magnitude, but later revised that up to 6.8.
10671	14293	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake registered 6.7 magnitude.
10672	14294	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	A series of smaller aftershocks rattled the area, including one with a 4.2 magnitude.
10673	14295	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Koichi Uhira of the Meteorological Agency warned that the aftershocks could continue for a week.
10674	14297	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Officials said water and gas services for Kashiwazaki's 35,000 households were suspended after reports of gas leaks, reports said.
10675	14298	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	About 18,000 households were without power as of Monday afternoon.
10676	14300	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Niigata Airport, which had suspended flights shortly after the quake, resumed services after finding no damage, Kyodo said.

10682	14310	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the divisive issues.
10683	14311	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to find a way to live together,'' she said.
10684	14316	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead, he said, it should ``get on with the work of the Gospel.''

10686	14320	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	At several points during her hour-long webcast from New York, in which she answered questions submitted by phone, e-mail and from a studio audience, she acknowledged the anguish and anxiety the conflict was causing those on all sides.
10687	14321	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.
10688	14323	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori advised.
10689	14324	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``It seems very harsh,'' the caller said.
10690	14325	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her concerns.
10691	14326	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	But she repeated her call for forbearance.
10692	14327	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``We are being pushed toward a decision by impatient forces within and outside this church who hunger for clarity,'' she said.
10693	14328	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``That hunger for clarity at all costs is an anxious response to discomfort in the face of change.''

10696	14332	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed.
10697	14334	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials in Baghdad seemed surprised by al-Sadr's return, which comes at a key juncture in Iraq.
10698	14335	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Officials in Iraq and Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
10699	14337	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Members of al-Sadr's al-Mahdi militia staged two major uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004.
10700	14338	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back.
10701	14339	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government
10702	14340	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	a 3-month-old security plan has made few inroads against withering violence
10703	14341	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	and speculation is rife about how much longer U.S.-led forces will remain actively engaged.
10704	14345	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said.
10705	14346	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``And Sadr is probably the biggest player in that because he has a large chunk of the vote, and he controls the street.''
10706	14347	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
10707	14348	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
10708	14349	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
10709	14350	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
10710	14352	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
10711	14353	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
10712	14354	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
10713	14355	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
10714	14357	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Iraq is now facing a severe crisis in all aspects, politically, economically and security wise,'' he said.
10715	14358	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We as a political movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
10716	14359	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have said that al-Sadr fled to Iran ahead of the U.S. troop buildup that began Feb. 13.
10717	14361	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for the first time in more than four months.
10718	14362	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
10719	14363	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
10720	14364	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice.
10721	14365	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to Israel.
10722	14366	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to America.

10724	14368	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his traditional black robes and turban.
10725	14369	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``The government should not allow the occupiers to extend their stay in Iraq, not even for one more day.''
10726	14370	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr said he stood ready to defend Sunnis and Christians who have been targeted by extremists, even as he underlined his displeasure with proposals to re-integrate members of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arab regime into the government and civil service -- one of the benchmarks for continued U.S. support.

10757	14422	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The unusually warm winter has left little snow on the ground for the upcoming World Winter University Games, but organizers said Monday the events will be held without any great problems.
10758	14423	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The situation was almost the opposite last year when the same slopes hosted the Winter Olympic Games in near perfect conditions.
10759	14424	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	At present the only slope with insufficient snow is the one used for the snowboarding events but organizers said that they expected to resolve this in time.
10760	14426	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	A total of 11 sports will be represented at the games: the biathlon, Nordic combined, curling, ice hockey, figure skating, ski jumping, Alpine and cross country skiing, long and short track speed skating and snowboarding.
10761	14430	AFP_ENG_20070116.0361.LDC2009T13	"It could be weeks, it could be more or... less," he said, refusing to give a more precise date of arrival.

10776	14453	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	The Senate's decision, he said, surprised him.
10777	14454	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"I thought they would help the industry because they should know how many people would be affected if they didn't," Greenwood said with a mixture of fatalism and hope.

10779	14456	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"You never know," Greenwood said, turning his collar up against the freezing temperature, "somebody in Washington could come to their senses.
10780	14457	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	They could get enough to get through this year.
10781	14458	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	In the long run, though, I think they'll punt it to Obama."
10782	14459	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Latrice Jackson, however, had little sympathy for Detroit's automakers, or its workers.

10802	14492	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Some of the property was recovered in neighbouring Mozambique.
10803	14493	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	Sentencing the pair, regional magistrate Gladys Pise said: "Rape is a very grave offence, especially in this case when it is committed on a respected member of society and you did not (only) demean and traumatise her, but shocked her as well."
10804	14494	AFP_ENG_20070503.0097.LDC2009T13	The two robbers are also facing other charges including one of gang-raping a 13 -year-old schoolgirl who later died while waiting to be treated at a local clinic and killing a security guard.
10805	14499	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The artillery bombardment sent clouds of white smoke rising from the camp, and the shelling ignited fires inside it, spewing black smoke.
10806	14500	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The militants have barricaded themselves in the camp's residential neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets and apartment buildings.
10807	14501	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	However, reports on the ground indicated the army did not penetrate deep into the camp, but limited its advance to outer neighborhoods militants use for sniper fire against army positions.
10808	14504	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He said there would be no storming of the camp's interior, where thousands of civilians remain.
10809	14508	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants also have been killed before Friday's fighting.
10810	14509	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	About 50 armored carriers, battle tanks and military vehicles from elite units massed at the northern edge of the camp and drove toward the forward positions, according to an AP Television News crew at the scene.
10811	14510	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling, accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the troops were in close combat with the militants.
10812	14511	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	But the bombardment again intensified several hours later.
10813	14512	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's northern edge.

10817	14520	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"It seems they have destroyed those positions."
10818	14523	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	A soldier belonging to an armored carriers unit on the camp's edge said the troops were advancing slowly and fighting building- to-building, after bombing positions in the morning.
10819	14524	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"They are in very well-fortified positions," he said of the militants, adding troops were coming under sniper fire.
10820	14525	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media.
10821	14526	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Television footage showed the movement of T-55 Russian-made tanks, French-made Panhard tanks, M-113 U.S.-built armored personnel carriers and jeeps with 106mm rifles mounted on them.
10822	14527	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Sandbags were packed on some of the vehicles.
10823	14528	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Military officials would not comment on the movement and journalists were ordered further back from the camp.
10824	14529	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	But a statement by the army command said troops came under fire from the militants and that the army was "responding with accurate and decisive fire to deter them" while also avoiding civilian casualties.

10899	14650	XIN_ENG_20081118.0271.LDC2009T13	In all, two people died.
10900	14651	XIN_ENG_20081118.0271.LDC2009T13	Thirty-two others were rescued early this morning.
10901	14652	XIN_ENG_20081118.0271.LDC2009T13	They spent almost 23 hours underground in a flooded mine shaft.
10902	14653	XIN_ENG_20081118.0271.LDC2009T13	All are described as being in stable condition at a local hospital.

10908	14665	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Public Accounts Committee, composed of government and opposition lawmakers, said the 1.6 billion ringgit ($454 million) deal to purchase 12 EC725 helicopters from Eurocopter followed correct procedures.
10909	14666	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee investigated opposition accusations that the price was too high and the negotiations did not go through proper channels -- even though the deal was scrapped last week because of budget constraints amid the global economic crisis.

10912	14670	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee discussed the deal with Defense and Finance ministry officials after opposition politicians claimed there were irregularities in the tender process and that the price tag was too high.

10920	14679	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GOING WITH THE FLOW
10921	14680	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Back in the 1970s, when Lou Casagrande was starting out as a curator at the Science Museum of Minnesota, visiting a museum aimed at kids sometimes felt like being in a "pinball machine."
10922	14682	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We went probably too far.
10923	14683	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was too much energy.
10924	14684	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
10925	14685	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	That was then.
10926	14686	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Now, as Casagrande readies the Children's Museum for its April 14 reopening, he's talking up the new exhibitions, from the tennis ball launcher to a light-box dance floor.
10927	14687	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow.
10928	14688	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art - but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum used to feel.
10929	14689	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"For us," Casagrande says, "this is the biggest revolution."
10930	14690	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
10931	14691	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some spots - the fourth floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible to find.
10932	14692	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
10933	14693	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
10934	14694	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
10935	14695	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new building won't alleviate all these problems.
10936	14696	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But several key design features should help.
10937	14697	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
10938	14698	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors, some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
10939	14699	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	While many a city has gotten into the children's museum business lately, Boston's edition has a long history.
10940	14701	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
10941	14702	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	After two decades in its spot, the museum undertook a renovation plan, closing on Dec. 31 to complete its current expansion.
10942	14703	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled, rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front of the taller, existing brick warehouse building.
10943	14704	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The defining feature of the newer space is its open feel.
10944	14705	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
10945	14706	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A series of 10- to 12-foot-wide hallways, reached by a stairway or elevator and stretching the entire length of the expansion, connect the new section with the old.
10946	14707	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	This is how visitors get around.
10947	14708	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for visitors to pause and relax.
10948	14709	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
10949	14710	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Visitor flow has driven the new project to the point that the expanded Children's Museum isn't actually all that much bigger than the old space.
10950	14711	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
10951	14712	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	How can an expanded museum be barely expanded?
10952	14713	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the institution's needs.
10953	14715	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing is the museum becomes much more functional."
10954	14716	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Consider how the space is used.
10955	14717	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The fourth floor is now off limits to visitors, used mainly for offices.
10956	14718	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A bigger and technologically updated KidStage has moved from the tucked away corner to the ground floor.
10957	14719	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	With three floors, not four, open to the public, activity is pushed down, and spread throughout.
10958	14720	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
10959	14721	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Wide doorways have been cut into the brick that used to be the outside of the museum.
10960	14722	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Each gallery is accessible through the bridges.
10961	14723	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the ease with which its visitors walk through the building.
10962	14724	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Smaller, newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
10963	14726	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
10964	14727	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum.
10965	14728	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The KidPower section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move an exhibit sign up and down.
10966	14729	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There's a dedicated space for traveling exhibitions.
10967	14730	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story climb.
10968	14731	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon Pain.
10969	14733	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs, and a giant chess game.

11491	15264	XIN_ENG_20070107.0050.LDC2009T13	According to an ordinance of Military Committee for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) published on Friday, the declaration of candidacy should be announced before the midnight of January 25.
11492	15266	XIN_ENG_20070107.0050.LDC2009T13	The candidatures will be received by the Constitutional Committee who will rule on the legality, establish the provisional list of candidates and make it public on January 26.
11493	15267	XIN_ENG_20070107.0050.LDC2009T13	The definitive list of candidates will be published before February 9, added with the ordinance which specifies that the polls "will be open from 7a.

11495	15269	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answers to Home-Care Questions
11496	15270	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Question: Once in 2002, and again in 2006, I have had the wall- to-wall carpeting in my co-op professionally cleaned.
11497	15271	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
11498	15272	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	(By the way, I don't smell anything.)
11499	15273	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid over a concrete slab and that's the problem.
11500	15274	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
11501	15275	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
11502	15276	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What else can be done?
11503	15277	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
11504	15278	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
11505	15279	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
11506	15280	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet of floor in a 24-hour period.
11507	15281	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, the acceptable level is 4.5 pounds or less.
11508	15282	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
11509	15283	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
11510	15284	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I think you have a legitimate concern, and I would advise against installing new carpeting in your co-op.
11511	15285	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
11512	15286	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now, what are your options?
11513	15287	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Well, let's assume your building is older and that the concrete has been in place for some time.
11514	15288	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
11515	15289	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I would suggest installing a tile floor, which will allow some moisture from the slab to rise through into the living space.
11516	15290	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To deal with the moisture from the slab, use one or two dehumidifiers.
11517	15291	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
11518	15292	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
11519	15293	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q.: I've lived in my home for 48 years.
11520	15294	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
11521	15295	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
11522	15296	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
11523	15297	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What's the truth?
11524	15298	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
11525	15299	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``That's too much,'' he said.
11526	15300	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is to look for the white stones in the asphalt.
11527	15301	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	When you can see the white stones, then it's time.''
11528	15302	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
11529	15303	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Hope that helps.
11530	15304	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a problem with clover.
11531	15305	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
11532	15306	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Also what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
11533	15307	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
11534	15308	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I tend to have a lot of clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
11535	15309	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
11536	15310	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
11537	15311	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told by organic experts that, depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant after a season or two.
11538	15312	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin.
11539	15313	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Ants don't like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
11540	15314	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
11541	15315	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.
11542	15316	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks, silverfish, flies and spiders.
11543	15317	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.

11551	15330	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"We've asked NATO to please support us, support our effort in destroying the labs and also the interdiction of the drugs and the chemical precursors that are coming from outside the country for making heroin," Wardak told reporters after the meeting.
11552	15331	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Wardak's appeal follows lobbying by the United States to persuade allies to hit back against the insurgency by striking against the drug lords who are estimated to provide up to US$100 million (euro72.83 million) a year to the Taliban and their al-Qaida allies.

11557	15345	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	De Hoop Scheffer said several allies had come forward with more contributions, but he declined to give details, and said it was not enough.
11558	15346	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"I'm not satisfied and I'm not happy about the way the allies are performing in this regard," he told reporters, saying a lack of helicopters and transport planes remained a particular problem.

11762	15643	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Hamadeh, a leading anti-Syrian politician, said that while all pro-government groups had agreed to Moussa's three-point proposal to resume dialogue, the opposition rejected it.
11763	15644	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Members of the Syria-backed opposition could not immediately be reached for comment.
11764	15645	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Lebanon is facing its most serious political crisis since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, with the Western-backed government and the Hezbollah-led opposition locked in a fierce power struggle.
11765	15647	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The crisis has taken on an increasingly sectarian tone and has erupted into street clashes between supporters of pro- and anti- government factions in recent months, killing 11 people.
11766	15648	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	One of the opposition's key demands is the creation of a new national unity government in which it has veto power.
11767	15649	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The existing government has so far resisted such a move.
11768	15650	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	A political crisis is looming over the presidency as well.
11769	15652	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Lebanon has also been shaken by a string of bombings and assassinations in the past two years targeting mainly anti-Syrian politicians and journalists.
11770	15653	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The latest victim was anti-Syrian lawmaker Walid Eido, who was killed along with his son, two bodyguards and six passers-by last week in a car bombing in Beirut.
11771	15655	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"There is a chance for all (parties) to sit together and reach an understanding on the country's problems," Moussa said.
11772	15656	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"Dialogue is a right, a duty and is in the interest of all the Lebanese," he said.
11773	15658	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Without setting a date for the proposed dialogue, Moussa said such meetings should be held within "a definite time."
11774	15659	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the proposed agenda for the dialogue provided "elements" for a solution to the political crisis.
11775	15660	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the Arab League would continue its efforts, including contacts with regional and international powers, to help the Lebanese reach a solution to the crisis.
11776	15661	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa, leading an Arab League delegation, arrived here Tuesday in an attempt to help rival politicians end the monthslong political crisis.
11777	15662	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Parliament is not functioning and the government just barely, after a quarter of Cabinet members resigned.
11778	15665	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa said he would soon hold talks with Syria, which strongly supports the opposition's demand for a new government.
11779	15666	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The Arab League delegation was dispatched to Beirut after a foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week in the wake of Eido's assassination, which his supporters blamed on Syria.

11781	15668	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	Dec. 4, 2003: Luna's car and body are discovered in a creek in rural Pennsylvania.
11782	15669	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	March 12, 2004: Law enforcement authorities offer a $100,000 reward for information leading to the "resolution of the investigation" into Luna's death.
11783	15670	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	They also announce that they are investigating whether it's possible that Luna stabbed himself.
11784	15671	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	Dec. 2, 2004: The Baltimore FBI office releases a statement concluding that Luna was alone from the time he left his courthouse office to the time his body was found.
11785	15672	LTW_ENG_20081204.0078.LDC2009T13	January 2007: Luna's father asks a Pennsylvania coroner to conduct an inquest into his son's death but is refused.

11788	15675	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Struggling With War Stress, Veteran Lives Day to Day
11789	15676	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle Turner's husband sits in the recliner with the shades drawn.
11790	15677	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew.
11791	15678	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the phone in the other room, Michelle is pleading with the utility company to keep their power on.
11792	15679	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?"
11793	15681	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Troy, they don't care," Michelle says, her patience stretched.
11794	15683	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
11795	15685	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The panel returned with bold recommendations, including the creation of a national cadre of caseworkers and a complete overhaul of the military's disability system that compensates wounded soldiers.
11796	15686	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But so far, little has been done to sort out the mess of bureaucracy or put more money in the hands of newly disabled soldiers who are fending off evictions and foreclosures.
11797	15687	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the Turner house, that leaves an exhausted wife with chipped nail polish to hold up the family's collapsing world.
11798	15688	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
11799	15689	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But since Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
11800	15690	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
11801	15692	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
11802	15694	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or randomly explosive.
11803	15695	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
11804	15696	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
11805	15697	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't make decisions.
11806	15698	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is a worrywart.
11807	15699	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Fearful.
11808	15700	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's like they took Troy and put him in a different person."
11809	15701	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	As thousands of war-wounded lug their discharge papers and pill bottles home, more than a quarter are returning with PTSD and brain trauma.
11810	15702	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Compensation for these invisible injuries is more difficult and the social isolation more profound, especially in rural communities where pastures outnumber mental health providers.
11811	15704	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live in a small rental house in the northern tip of West Virginia, surrounded by enormous blue sky and the dark spine of South Branch Mountain.
11812	15705	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	There is a VFW tavern in town, but Troy doesn't bother.
11813	15706	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After one of his distraught soldier buddies from Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy stays away from alcohol.
11814	15709	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His speech is sometimes soupy from mood stabilizers.
11815	15710	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The meds give him tremors.
11816	15711	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He used to cut the grass and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a perpetual patient.
11817	15712	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle for everything.
11818	15713	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?"
11819	15714	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	he asks one day.
11820	15715	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle takes a breath.
11821	15716	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Orthopedic," she says.
11822	15718	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(end ital)
11823	15719	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At 31, her eyes are hollowed by worry and her brown hair is turning gray.
11824	15720	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
11825	15721	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The all-day journey requires a babysitter for the kids -- ages 10 and 11, both from previous marriages -- and burns $25 worth of precious gas.
11826	15722	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
11827	15723	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	One hot morning, they set out for Martinsburg yet again.
11828	15724	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury -- he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital wants him back for more comprehensive testing.
11829	15725	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy and Michelle are quiet on the ride into Martinsburg.
11830	15726	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Bible rests on the back seat.
11831	15727	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two- lane highway.
11832	15729	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Finally Troy says he thinks his new medication is making him less aggressive.
11833	15730	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
11834	15731	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You don't have an `off' button anymore," she says.
11835	15732	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy, in the passenger seat, keeps his eyes on the road.
11836	15733	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They broke it off when I was over there."
11837	15734	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
11838	15735	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before that, he spent a decade with the National Guard, pulling a tour in Bosnia.
11839	15737	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
11840	15739	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While he was on home leave from Fort Stewart one weekend, Michelle found him sitting on the bed with a bottle of pills.
11841	15740	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he couldn't go back.
11842	15741	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle drove him to the Martinsburg VA hospital, which shipped him to Walter Reed for three weeks of psychiatric care.
11843	15742	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He was sent back to Fort Stewart and returned to duty, a reality he could not cope with.
11844	15743	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
11845	15744	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
11846	15745	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
11847	15746	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.
11848	15747	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship, she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat her well.
11849	15748	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
11850	15749	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
11851	15750	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
11852	15751	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His family needed the $2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in the truck with him.
11853	15754	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Like many wounded soldiers, he was clobbered by a fine-print government regulation known as "concurrent receipt," which prevents double compensation.
11854	15755	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	That meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army.
11855	15756	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 13 months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was reimbursed.
11856	15758	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
11857	15759	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His illness has eroded their marriage, but on the morning they arrive at the Martinsburg VA hospital, she leads the charge on his behalf.
11858	15761	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
11859	15763	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cafeteria smells of bleach and canned peaches.
11860	15764	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the small lobby of the neuropsychological department, Troy leans over the sign-in clipboard, pen in hand, staring at the sheet.
11861	15765	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle tells him what day it is.
11862	15768	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A former Marine with ramrod posture, the vet has PTSD and an encyclopedic knowledge of VA procedures.
11863	15769	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
11864	15770	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Huntington (a VA regional office) says you are his fiduciary, right?"
11865	15771	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle says.
11866	15772	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
11867	15773	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't let these people get over on you!"
11868	15774	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She returns to the waiting room.
11869	15775	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
11870	15777	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse.
11871	15778	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
11872	15779	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
11873	15780	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in again.
11874	15782	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You think he's violent at this point?"
11875	15783	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.
11876	15784	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle dodges the question.
11877	15785	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He's not getting any counseling," she says, leaning against the door.
11878	15786	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The counselor explains that all 50 beds in the program are full and the waiting list is 25 deep.
11879	15787	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
11880	15788	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle's voice breaks.
11881	15789	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I know you are doing the best you can," she says.
11882	15790	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anymore, he's just ashamed.
11883	15791	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	I wish I had a video camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an average day looks like."
11884	15792	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests.
11885	15793	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
11886	15794	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He tells Michelle how hard he tried, and she smiles and touches his arm.
11887	15796	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately the doctor is on leave for the next month.

11889	15798	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
11890	15799	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
11891	15800	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have a three-hour drive."
11892	15801	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Nine o'clock is the they best they can do.
11893	15802	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
11894	15803	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office on the first floor.
11895	15804	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government has promised to care for its wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this, where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage reimbursed.
11896	15805	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977.
11897	15806	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is still paid 11 cents a mile.
11898	15807	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
11899	15808	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
11900	15809	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the way home, Michelle pulls into a Flying J truck stop, pumping gas in the hot breeze, watching the numbers spin higher.
11901	15810	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Money became so desperate this spring that Michelle contacted Operation Homefront, a national organization that gives emergency assistance to deployed service members and the returning wounded.
11902	15811	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In a sign of the deepening financial crisis faced by many back from war, Operation Homefront has provided $2 million in bailout funds to 4,300 families so far in 2007, double last year's caseload.
11903	15812	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.
11904	15813	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they had no other choice.
11905	15814	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The $860 VA disability check barely covers expenses.
11906	15815	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has been pushing to have VA re-evaluate Troy in hopes of getting his disability rating raised and his compensation increased.
11907	15816	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function without her.
11908	15817	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
11909	15818	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
11910	15819	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.
11911	15821	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
11912	15822	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is "chronic and severe."
11913	15823	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle gets copies of the medical records and sits down with them on her living room floor.
11914	15824	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Wearing an Army T-shirt that says "Got Freedom?"

11917	15827	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels sickened.

11920	15830	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He sees himself fighting, sees dead bodies, parts of bodies, blood rushing from bodies.
11921	15831	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he hears bullets passing over his head.
11922	15832	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is fearful and scared and wakes up in cold sweats.

11926	15837	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From time to time she looks up at him, then her eyes go back to the records.

11938	15850	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They are saying your memory is extremely low," she says.
11939	15851	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"And here's another thing.
11940	15852	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	`Hearing loss.
11941	15853	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
11942	15855	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	According to VA, he doesn't meet the criteria for 100 percent because his impairment is not "persistent," with "persistent delusions" or a "persistent danger of hurting himself or others."
11943	15856	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is still able to perform his own hygiene.
11944	15857	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From Michelle's point of view, Troy can hold a toothbrush, but he can't hold a job.
11945	15858	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
11946	15859	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She has a year to appeal the rating.
11947	15860	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
11948	15861	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
11949	15862	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
11950	15863	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.
11951	15864	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
11952	15865	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	During the intake session in Martinsburg, he is withdrawn and sullen.
11953	15866	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
11954	15867	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The news punches Michelle in the gut.
11955	15868	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is allowed to come home on weekends, so Michelle makes the four-hour round trip to pick him up on the first Friday night.
11956	15869	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
11957	15870	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
11958	15871	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
11959	15872	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy returns to his recliner.
11960	15873	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA tells Michelle that a contract counselor who visits rural counties will be in touch to schedule time with Troy.
11961	15874	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
11962	15875	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
11963	15877	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They are strained beyond belief.
11964	15878	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, there are moments of gallows humor.
11965	15879	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
11966	15881	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
11967	15882	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
11968	15883	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy declines.
11969	15884	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
11970	15885	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he says.
11971	15886	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle raises an eyebrow.
11972	15887	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's still an injury."
11973	15888	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
11974	15889	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Plus, the fact that guys are missing arms and have bullet holes and everything else.
11975	15890	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Ain't a scratch on me."
11976	15891	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	To remember who Troy used to be, Michelle keeps a photo of him hidden in her camera case.
11977	15892	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the picture he is smiling and eager, ruggedly at home in his Army fatigues.
11978	15893	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now she looks at the man in the recliner.
11979	15894	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's people like you that made our country," Michelle says.
11980	15895	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back to filling out forms, and Troy goes back to Nickelodeon.

12016	15952	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Rangers boss Walter Smith on Friday welcomed a UEFA decision to take no action against Barry Ferguson over an altercation with a Hapoel Tel Aviv player in the club's UEFA Cup defeat in Israel this week.
12017	15953	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Gers captain Ferguson appeared to strike Hapoel's Tal Chen after being floored by Luciano De Bruno during the 2-1 first leg defeat on Wednesday, and afterwards Hapoel's coach Nir Levin called on UEFA to look at the incident.

12045	15988	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Secretary of the Home Ministry Umesh Mainali said the task of holding CA polls across the country at the same time would be difficult because of the insufficient number of police personnel, including Armed Police Force (APF) at the government's disposal.
12046	15989	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a program held in Dolakha, some 50 km east of Kathmandu, Mainali said, "With the Election Commission's (EC) repeated refusal to hold the elections, it will be very difficult for some 55,000 police and 23,000 APF to provide security at all polling booths."
12047	15990	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Stating that it was impossible to assign three-four police personnel per polling station, Home Secretary Mainali said that it was necessary to set up temporary security outfits for the election.
12048	15991	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Claiming that the Home Ministry was committed to holding timely election come what may, Mainali informed that 455 vehicles -- enough for each police post -- had already arrived and that the government will make arrangements for 10,000 communication sets.
12049	15994	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The ministry said in a statement that 150 Tigers had been holding the bases and searches suggested many had been killed or wounded.

12055	16002	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The latest offensive is the biggest since troops captured the town of Vakarai from the Tigers in January after weeks of heavy fighting in Batticaloa district.

12072	16032	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The mother of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager whose life-ending battle with AIDS in the 1980s engrossed Americans, wants to meet with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to discuss his comments 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been isolated.
12073	16033	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The former Arkansas governor and Republican front-runner in the important Iowa caucuses said Sunday that he stood by the comments.
12074	16034	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	That has infuriated Jeanne White-Ginder, who said: "It's so alarming to me."
12075	16035	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press from her home in Leesburg, Florida, she said: "It's very important to me that we don't live in the darkness" when people thought AIDS was transmitted through casual contact, such as by "kissing, tears, sweat and saliva."
12076	16036	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"We have to treat this disease like a disease, and like Ryan always said, not like a dirty word," she said.
12077	16037	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	White was 13 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984, having contracted the disease from the blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
12078	16038	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He was barred from school the following year out of fear the disease was spread casually.
12079	16039	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He died in 1990 at age 18.
12080	16040	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, and the AIDS Institute were sending a letter to Huckabee asking him to meet with White-Ginder -- who declined in the interview to say what political party she belongs to -- and calling his comments "completely beyond comprehension."
12081	16041	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	As a Senate candidate in 1992, Huckabee told the AP in a questionnaire that "we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague" if the federal government was going to deal with the spread of the disease effectively.
12082	16042	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents," he said then.
12083	16043	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Huckabee denied that those words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population, although he did not explain how else isolation would be achieved.
12084	16044	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I didn't say we should quarantine," he said.
12085	16045	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The idea was not to "lock people up."
12086	16046	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then, and since, that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through casual contact, but said that was not certain.
12087	16047	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I still believe this today," Huckabee said Sunday, that "we were acting more out of political correctness" in responding to the AIDS crisis.
12088	16048	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I don't run from it, I don't recant it," he said of his position in 1992.
12089	16049	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Yet he said he would state his view differently in retrospect.

12146	16135	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	It doesn't -- thanks to the film's airtight (or close to it) logic and attention-deficit pacing, which means that any existing plot holes whoosh past too fast to notice.
12147	16136	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I did not feel encouraged to think while watching this movie.
12148	16137	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I did, however, feel encouraged to gasp in amazement whenever cinematographer Amir Mokri hyper-zoomed on someone's eyeballs (they're staring
12149	16138	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I get it) and gasp in shock at the plot twists, some of which were stupidly and unnecessarily blown in the trailer.

12174	16176	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	He did not elaborate on what pricing system or exchange would be used to calculate the crude price.
12175	16177	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The government will provide a public subsidy of 30 sen (9 cents) per liter of gasoline to keep the retail price lower than the market rate, Abdullah also said.
12176	16178	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	He added that the pump price would not exceed the current 2.70 ringgit (US$0.83) per liter for the rest of this year.
12177	16179	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The new mechanism comes after the government hiked gasoline prices by 41 percent in June to curb a runaway subsidy bill.
12178	16180	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The increase caused year-on-year inflation to spiral to 7.7 percent that month -- the steepest rate in more than 27 years.

12183	16185	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	LAKE FOREST, Ill.
12184	16186	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In football and in life, Chicago Bears cornerback Ricky Manning has made mistakes.
12185	16187	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Messy, public ones.
12186	16188	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he cannot complain about the way things have turned out.
12187	16190	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Two field goals by Robbie Gould, the second one in the fifth minute of overtime, propelled the Bears to a 27-24 victory and catapulted Manning into his third National Football Conference championship game in four seasons.
12188	16191	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	That reversal of fortune mirrored what has happened in Manning's life over the past 10 months.
12189	16192	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
12190	16193	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
12191	16194	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After the news of his latest arrest became public, the Carolina Panthers declined to match the Bears' five-year, $21 million offer for Manning, who was a restricted free agent.
12192	16195	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	The 25-year-old Manning already was on probation from a previous assault in Los Angeles, and if his case had gone to trial he faced the possibility of a prison sentence.
12193	16196	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't willing to take that risk," he said.
12194	16197	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.
12195	16198	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was suspended for one game by the NFL for violation of its code of personal conduct, causing him to miss the Bears' 17-13 loss at New England on Nov. 26.
12196	16199	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	When he plays, he makes a difference.
12197	16200	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's been a big part of what we're doing," Bears coach Lovie Smith said Monday of Manning, who had five interceptions during the regular season and added a sixth Sunday in the fourth quarter off Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.
12198	16201	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Asked to describe his interception, Manning said, "I guess it's just being in the right place at the right time."
12199	16202	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.
12200	16203	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Later, while putting a square diamond-studded earring in his left ear, Manning marveled at how much has changed since last year when he stood in the victorious visitors locker room after the Panthers' 29-21 divisional playoff victory against the Bears.
12201	16204	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been a whirlwind," he said.
12202	16205	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Confronting his legal issues was just part of it.
12203	16206	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After taking stock of his life, Manning broke up with his fianc?e, married a woman from his hometown, Fresno, Calif., whom he had been friends with for years, and became a father.
12204	16207	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His son, Ricky III, was born on Nov. 14.
12205	16208	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"The last nine months has been a drastic change for me," Manning said.
12206	16209	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been crazy."
12207	16210	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.
12208	16211	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I'm smiling.
12209	16212	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I've got a kid.
12210	16213	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm married to a beautiful lady.
12211	16214	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Because of the trouble I got in, that's why my life has changed, but I like the change."
12212	16215	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning used part of the signing bonus he received from the Bears to buy a Bentley, but it does not get much of a workout.
12213	16216	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His circumstances have caused him to become a homebody.
12214	16217	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't go out anymore," he said.
12215	16218	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't do anything."
12216	16219	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A gun enthusiast, Manning said he no longer frequents the firing range.
12217	16220	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He has given his guns to friends and relatives until his probation is over.
12218	16221	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He sends his regrets when he is invited to parties.
12219	16222	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I miss some of the guys' parties that they're throwing," Manning said, "but they understand.
12220	16223	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	They know I just can't take that chance of something happening."
12221	16224	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
12222	16225	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
12223	16226	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	For starters, he did not need to be out with a friend at 3 a.m.
12224	16227	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Me being out at 3 o'clock at night and partying and being around people that can take advantage of me is just not a good situation," he said.
12225	16228	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Initially I reacted to getting disrespected when I thought I shouldn't have been," he added.
12226	16229	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"OK, I shouldn't have done that.
12227	16230	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But I thought I had done the right thing by walking away, by leaving."
12228	16231	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he was arrested nonetheless and his public image took a brutal hit.
12229	16232	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It was tough, knowing that what happened gives people a misconception of me," Manning said.
12230	16233	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He added, "It took for that to happen for me to learn."
12231	16234	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Since April, Manning has joined the Bears' family and created a family of his own.
12232	16235	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He keeps his relatives closer, having come to the conclusion that they are the best company because they will not lead him astray.
12233	16236	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He flew in some cousins for the game Sunday, some of whom had never traveled by airplane before.
12234	16237	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.
12235	16238	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In his arms, he was cradling his sleeping son.
12236	16239	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning walked past a makeshift TV studio where Gould was being interviewed about his game-winning field goal.
12237	16240	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A dozen fans, many of them holding camera phones as if they were lighters at a concert, had gathered to pay homage to Gould and were blocking the exit.
12238	16241	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A security guard cleared a path for Manning, who slipped through as cleanly as a knife through a perfectly baked cake.
12239	16242	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Not a single fan stuck to him.
12240	16243	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.
12241	16245	AFP_ENG_20071116.0580.LDC2009T13	A powerful cyclone smashed through southern Bangladesh killing more than 200 people as it uprooted trees, destroyed homes and forced thousands to take refuge in shelters, an official said Friday.
12242	16246	AFP_ENG_20071116.0580.LDC2009T13	"The death toll has risen to above 200 and we are still getting more reports of deaths," said Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman, officer-in- charge of the control room at the ministry of relief and disaster management.

12244	16249	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Serena Williams reached her third consecutive final and won her 14th straight match when she beat Alize Cornet of France 7-5, 6-3 at the Family Circle Cup on Saturday.
12245	16251	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams was 4-1 lifetime against Zvonareva.
12246	16252	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	This will be Zvonareva's third final of the year, and fourth since her last title at 2006 Cincinnati.
12247	16253	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She has played two three-set matches in as many days, but said she has the energy to beat Williams.
12248	16254	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I'll just have to stay focused the whole match," Zvonareva said.
12249	16255	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I'll have to not have ups and downs in the match and play as even as possible."
12250	16256	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Fifth-seeded Williams rallied from 4-1 down against the unseeded Cornet in their semifinal.
12251	16257	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams broke Cornet twice at love before taking the set.
12252	16258	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In a second set featuring long baseline rallies, Williams broke Cornet in the eighth game, then held serve at love to take the match.
12253	16259	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"In just the whole match I thought she played really well, and I just wasn't playing my game," Williams said.
12254	16260	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I got caught a little bit on the defensive a lot and I wasn't doing anything I should have been doing."
12255	16262	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She was runner-up earlier this year at Acapulco, her best showing on the tour since joining it last year.
12256	16263	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Saturday was the first time she faced Williams.
12257	16264	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"It was a little bit of a surprise for her because she didn't know me," Cornet said.
12258	16265	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I was like making the pressure on her and it was working and after 4-1, you know, she played better."
12259	16266	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Cornet said she has learned a lesson by reaching two consecutive semifinals.
12260	16267	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I have to fight and I have to play my game, and I think I have the level now for beating the best, so it's a lot of confidence for me," she said.
12261	16268	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams said she will surely be facing Cornet again.
12262	16269	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"She gets a lot of balls back, and those kind of players are usually around for a good 20 years," Williams said.
12263	16270	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams, who ousted No. 2 Maria Sharapova in Friday's quarterfinals, won her last two tournaments in Bangalore and Key Biscayne, and was 18-1 on the year.

12295	16307	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	U.N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari was in Myanmar's bunker-like new capital Sunday hoping to nudge the country's ruling generals into reconciliation talks with their pro-democracy opponents.
12296	16308	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari arrived Saturday for his second visit since the junta violently suppressed anti-government demonstrations in September.
12297	16309	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The day before his arrival in Yangon, the isolated Southeast Asian nation's largest city, the junta announced it planned to expel the top U.N. diplomat in the country, adding an extra hurdle to the envoy's already difficult mission.
12298	16313	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The military has said 10 people were killed in the crackdown, but diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is much higher.
12299	16314	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people were detained.
12300	16315	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta gave foreign diplomats and U.N. representatives a note saying the government did not intend to continue Petrie's assignment in the country.
12301	16316	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.N. said in a statement that Gambari met with Petrie after his arrival and would "stay in Myanmar as long as necessary to accomplish his mission."
12302	16318	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari was earlier dispatched to Myanmar after the government crackdown, meeting with Than Shwe as well as twice with Suu Kyi.
12303	16319	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	But little of substance has changed on Myanmar's political scene since, and analysts expect that little will result from Gambari's current visit.

12314	16337	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Similar warnings reached governments as far away as Bangladesh and Kenya, where coastal residents and tourists were ushered off beaches with megaphones and onto higher ground.
12315	16338	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They were quite fast in delivering the warning.
12316	16340	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"The president announced the system will be ready in 2008, but this earthquake showed it's working already."
12317	16341	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Officials acknowledged there were glitches, with evacuations in Indonesia marked by fear and panic in some hard-hit neighborhoods.
12318	16343	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The 2004 tsunami hit southern Thailand, including the tourist resort of Phuket, and killed more than 8,000 people.
12319	16346	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	That disaster was marked by failure to warn many communities about the impending waves, mostly due to faulty equipment, poor communications and cumbersome bureaucracy.
12320	16347	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It prompted the United Nations and six government donors, including the United States, to create a US$130 million (euro97 million) tsunami warning system, which is expected to be fully operational at the end next year.
12321	16348	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Progress was initially slowed by bickering over technical problems with deep-sea monitoring buoys.
12322	16349	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Governments also came under fire for failing to educate citizens about the threat of tsunamis, bolster coastal infrastructure, and establishing ways to pass along warnings to remote villages.
12323	16350	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, Indonesia, which was hit hardest by the 2004 disaster, has installed dozens of tidal gauges and deep-ocean tsunami monitoring buoys to detect waves as well as more than 150 seismometers to detect earthquakes.
12324	16351	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It has vastly improved its communication network, resulting in a quake alert going out within minutes of the actual temblor.
12325	16352	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The quake was detected on a seismograph which relays a message to the country's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency.
12326	16353	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It then sent a warning to hundreds of emergency management personnel in the disaster-hit regions.
12327	16355	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	G.G. Somaratne from Payagala, a southern coastal town in Sri Lanka, said that all his neighbors were panic-stricken when the tsunami warning came.
12328	16356	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"We took all our valuable goods to the second floor of a neighbor, carried whatever we could take and went to a relative's home some seven miles away," said Somaratne, who is still rebuilding his beachside home destroyed in 2004.
12329	16357	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People were in temples and churches, relatives and friends, and returned after the warning was lifted, but some are still scared to come back," he said.
12330	16358	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In Bangladesh, volunteers with bullhorns warned villagers to evacuate to higher or inland areas, while local television and radio stations issued warnings as town halls opened control rooms to monitor the situation.
12331	16362	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People didn't run to the water," after the quakes, he said.

12337	16369	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy, left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating concerns about inflation.
12338	16370	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
12339	16371	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
12340	16372	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep easing.
12341	16373	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
12342	16375	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, he is not a voting member of the FOMC this year.
12343	16376	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.
12344	16377	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
12345	16378	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday before the Fed announcement, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 2006 as strong consumer spending and an improving trade picture offset severe slowdowns in housing and auto production.
12346	16379	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said, "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."
12347	16380	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
12348	16382	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
12349	16383	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough waters of a severe housing slump.
12350	16384	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a considerable period.
12351	16385	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	And some are worried that there could be rate hikes in the second half of the year if inflation does not slow further.
12352	16386	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed last changed rates back in June when it pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, up to 5.25 percent.
12353	16387	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had nudged rates up by a quarter-point.
12354	16388	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Before the Fed started raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more than four decades.
12355	16389	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

12357	16392	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	In the next several weeks, the New York Stock Exchange plans to shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged, the New York Times reported Sunday on its website.
12358	16393	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The exchange has been the hub of financial activity in Lower Manhattan for more than a century, but the buzz emanating from its famous trading floor is dying down as computerized trading has rapidly reduced the need for face-to-face transactions.
12359	16394	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak.

12361	16396	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade.

12366	16401	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The decline in activity at the exchange's headquarters at 11 Wall Street is palpable.
12367	16402	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds to survey the floor from the visitors' gallery or watch the ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells.
12368	16404	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Inside the exchange, a once-vital organ has been reduced to a reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable.

12390	16447	APW_ENG_20071221.0805.LDC2009T13	A nephew of Trevor Berbick has been convicted along with another man of killing the 54-year-old former heavyweight champion.

12400	16458	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But with two days to think about it, Torre admonished Rodriguez on Friday.
12401	16459	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"It's probably something he shouldn't have done," Torre said before the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox.

12403	16461	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	I don't sense he's going to do it again.
12404	16462	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Just the reaction probably told him that.

12408	16466	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told Rodriguez on the field that he had made a bush league play, something more appropriate for a Little Leaguer, and repeated those assertions to reporters after the game.

12412	16470	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Torre, who gave a lukewarm defense of Rodriguez immediately after Wednesday's game, said he spoke with Rodriguez that night about the play.
12413	16471	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I sensed from our conversation it won't happen again," Torre said.

12418	16477	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"No over ever gave me credit for making a smart play, because I wasn't in favor," Jackson said.
12419	16478	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"They said it was a cheap shot.
12420	16479	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Now, A-Rod's not in favor.
12421	16480	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	People won't appreciate him until he's done.

12525	16613	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	A Sept. 25, 2001, Justice Department memo declared that under the Constitution decisions regarding the "amount of military force to be used" in response to the terrorist threat, as well as "the method, timing and nature of the response," are "for the president alone to make."
12526	16614	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."
12527	16615	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
12528	16617	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	He has issued a steady stream of signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority to limit coercive interrogation tactics.
12529	16620	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe.
12530	16623	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
12531	16626	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	That conservative backlash gained ground during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in the minority report of the Iran-contra committee.
12532	16629	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	As Schwarz and Huq see it, the Bush White House's "broader efforts to seize unfettered control of national security policy and to eliminate the checks and balances imposed by Congress and the courts" is exemplified by its post 9/11 decision "to ignore legal constraints on torture."
12533	16631	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately narrow definition of torture.
12534	16632	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	One 2002 memo defined it as causing the sort of "intense pain or suffering" ordinarily associated "with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result."
12535	16634	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	For instance the authors observe that a presidential finding signed days after 9/11 gave the CIA sweeping new powers to disrupt terrorist activity and permission to kill, capture and detain members of Al Qaida anywhere in the world: powers, in the view of some intelligence officers, that included the implicit authority to create black sites (secret detention facilities outside the United States, where terrorism suspects could be held beyond the Bush's signing of a 2002 presidential order authorizing NSA surveillance in the homeland without a court- approved warrant, an order that effectively circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed by Congress in 1978.
12536	16635	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although briefings were provided to a handful of congressional leaders, Schwarz and Huq report, those leaders were prohibited from saying anything about them to anyone, including other intelligence committee members, a stipulation that "gutted the possibility of effective oversight."
12537	16637	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Indeed, the abiding genius of the Founding Generation was its rejection of the idea that unchecked unilateral power is ever properly vested in any one branch of government.
12538	16638	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Our government was framed 'to control itself,' as James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers.
12539	16639	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	'Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'
12540	16640	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Dividing powers between three branches, the Founders harnessed human passions in the cause of limited government.
12541	16641	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."'

12570	16683	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Verdi ' s " La forza del destino " vocally wonderful, visually vibrant
12571	16685	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Giuseppe Verdi was worried about "all those dead bodies" in his "La forza del destino."
12572	16686	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, there weren't enough for some in the audience.
12573	16687	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	"Verdi's assassins," yelled someone in the audience after a particularly jarring scene.
12574	16689	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	True, some of the settings in this Vienna State Opera production were more "Stagecoach" than opera.
12575	16690	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Lightly clad cowgirls hefting six-guns were stand-ins for the camp followers of the soldiers in the Verdi opera.
12576	16691	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tableaux of military life were turned into grisly portraits of Hell with a touch of Bosch, mixed with T.S. Eliot.
12577	16692	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And Pountney's skeptical view of religion made the final moments of the hero's reconciliation with God, Heaven and the death of his beloved Leonora a hard sell.
12578	16693	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Adding to difficulties is that even without Pountney, this opera calls for an indulgent audience ready to accept a plot almost as cliche as the notion of "it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
12579	16694	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Don Alvaro, the hero, is caught in the bedroom of Leonora by her father.
12580	16695	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As he drops his pistol in submission it goes off, killing the elderly nobleman and setting into notion the "power of destiny" that ultimately leads to two more deaths
12581	16696	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	that of Leonora's brother by the hero and of Leonora herself, killed by her brother literally as he expires from the sword wound inflicted by Alvaro.
12582	16697	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Originally the hero himself was to commit suicide.
12583	16698	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Perhaps fearful of the prospect of nobody left to take a curtain call, Verdi himself wrote co-librettist Maria Piave: "We need to think about the ending and find some way to avoid all those dead bodies."
12584	16699	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	So in the version performed Saturday, Alvaro remains alive and redeemed, though deeply depressed.
12585	16700	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that the audience was spared that condition Saturday was due less to the controversial production and more to the excellence of the musical performances both on stage and in the pit.
12586	16702	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Under his baton, the violin section sounded as if one powerful instrument.
12587	16703	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His horns packed more oomph than any brass band.
12588	16704	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And his woodwinds were tremulous, breathy and vulnerable, reflecting the pathos of the action under the spotlights.
12589	16705	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His cues were perfect, his pauses powerful.
12590	16706	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The principals also rose to the musical challenge.
12591	16707	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Nina Stemme was a wonderful Leonora, with her Wagner-honed heroic soprano the perfect instrument for the vocal athletics called for by Verdi.
12592	16708	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Her voice was fully rounded, powerful and evocative at all levels.
12593	16709	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Complementing her sound was her excellent dramatic rendering of the heroine doomed by destiny.
12594	16710	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Among her highlights on Saturday: "Madre pietosa Vergine."
12595	16711	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	(Holy Mother hear my prayer.)
12596	16712	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The sporadic boos mixed with the bravos for Salvatore Licitra were undeserved.
12597	16713	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His warm and broad tenor was a lovely match for Stemme, making him a thoroughly enjoyable Alvaro.
12598	16714	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	But the best male role of the evening was given by Carlos Alvarez.
12599	16715	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As Don Carlo, Leonora's vengeful brother, his rich and vibrant baritone, coupled with a menacing and possessed stage presence, had all eyes and ears focused on him, at times even when he was not at center stage.
12600	16716	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Also good: the choir, under Thomas Lang
12601	16717	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Alastair Miles as Leonora's father and the father superior
12602	16718	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tiziano Bracci as Melitone, the friar, and Nadia Krasteva as Preziosilla, the camp fortuneteller who in Pountney's version turns into a pistol- packing, hotpants-wearing Annie Oakley.
12603	16719	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Saturday's performance was a mix of obsession, revenge, love and madness on stage
12604	16720	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	hatred from some audience members incensed with the production, and redemption, as in the healing power of wonderful music on stage and in the pit.

12636	16774	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	For 51 seconds.
12637	16775	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety.
12638	16776	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at 12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House Bid.''
12639	16777	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
12640	16779	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
12641	16781	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The news was already out at the time of The Post's online screwup.
12642	16782	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move quickly once the candidate announced his plans.
12643	16783	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady still isn't sure how the mistake happened.
12644	16784	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said.
12645	16785	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was an error of production ... Nobody knows how it got up because nobody hit the publishing button,'' Brady said.
12646	16787	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``This was a big story,'' Downie said.

12648	16789	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl DC.
12649	16790	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said.

12656	16797	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago, it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
12657	16798	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
12658	16799	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a brochure.
12659	16801	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot spring," Iwanaga, 21, said.
12660	16802	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"They really wanted us to come here."
12661	16803	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of higher education in Asia, but today its universities are scrambling to find new ways to attract students.
12662	16804	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Years of falling birthrates have rapidly shrunk the population of young Japanese, leaving more universities unable to find enough students to fill their classrooms and campuses.
12663	16806	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But it has only recently begun to affect higher education.
12664	16808	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	As a result, according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers' children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to 1.3 million this year.
12665	16809	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Estimates show it dropping to 1.21 million in two years.
12666	16811	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Roughly half of college-age Japanese attend universities.
12667	16812	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Only three universities have gone bankrupt for lack of students.
12668	16816	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We need to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting the education of their students."
12669	16817	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of prospective students, such as foreigners and "silver students," retirees who study for fun.
12670	16820	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has also halved tuition to 590,000 yen, or about $5,000.
12671	16821	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The school also created a "celebrity business" major to train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative pursuits like music, rather than the "salaryman" positions sought by their parents' generation.
12672	16824	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many fear that this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards to attract more students.
12673	16825	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a four-year break before entering the work force, some administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish.
12674	16827	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities realize they actually have to educate their students," Hamana said.
12675	16831	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign, including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
12676	16832	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Half of the classes are taught in English.
12677	16833	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university is also unusual in Japan because it has a full-fledged, American-style career office to help students find jobs.
12678	16834	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has been rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
12679	16836	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hagi converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year university in 1999 with grandiose plans of becoming the region's top school.
12680	16837	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But from the beginning, it failed to attract its annual capacity of 300 freshmen.
12681	16838	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The campus became increasingly empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to just three in 2006, the school said.
12682	16840	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Next, it hired a top professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
12683	16841	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for bankruptcy in 2005.
12684	16843	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"Problem was, there just weren't a lot of new students to be found."
12685	16845	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hatachi said the new focus should make it more competitive because in rapidly graying Japan, care for the elderly is one of the few guaranteed growth markets for young job seekers.
12686	16846	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education," he said.

12738	16916	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	But there were dozens of copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent, plus shipping.
12739	16917	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping.
12740	16918	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three -- nor the author got a share.
12741	16919	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The book looked good as new.

12762	16943	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Still, she sounded a little taken aback at the going rate for her books.

12766	16947	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If I had had to search for the book in a store, maybe I would never have found it.
12767	16948	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"With the Internet, nothing is ever lost," Lesser said.
12768	16949	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"That's the good news, and that's the bad news."
12769	16950	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	And what of the woman who sold me the book?
12770	16951	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She told me via e-mail that her real name was Heather Mash and that she worked as a domestic violence case manager in a women's shelter not too far from Berkeley.
12771	16952	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She didn't set out to subvert the publishing and bookselling world, she said.
12772	16953	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Like most of us who sell online, Mash began because she had too many books and wanted to raise money to buy more.

12826	17018	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	When a pack of rats invaded a fast food restaurant here, many people were shocked as they watched widely distributed video footage of the dozen twitchy rodents scampering across the eatery's floor.
12827	17019	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	But in a city like New York, businesses that handle food wage a seemingly endless battle against vermin.
12828	17020	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference with the rats caught on tape this week at a joint KFC and Taco Bell restaurant?
12829	17021	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Patrons usually do not see the creatures and certainly not in such large numbers.

12835	17028	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If you look, you're gonna find them."
12836	17029	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	According to the reports, rodents gnaw their way into sacks of cat and dog food, pasta and beef packages and loaves of bread.

12843	17036	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I mean, rats are supposed to be on the outside.
12844	17037	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	And mice are on the inside.
12845	17038	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If there's rats inside you got a real serious problem."
12846	17039	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	It's impossible to estimate how many rats there are in New York, experts say, but one popular belief is that there's one for each of the more than 8 million people in the city.
12847	17040	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Whatever the number, the rats have continued to thrive despite the city spending millions to eradicate them.
12848	17041	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The typical New York rat weighs about 1 pound (45 kilograms) and has a very flexible body, making it easy to squeeze though openings as small as a half inch (little more than a centimeter).
12849	17042	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Each year, a female rat can easily bear dozens of offspring that survive, said Frank Gasperini, a pest-control expert.
12850	17043	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	They sometimes bite people, but mostly, they just eat -- at least one ounce of food every 24 hours, according to Bobby Corrigan, a rat expert.
12851	17044	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	That means few food establishments are immune.
12852	17045	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"Even the most famous restaurants can get rats," Gasperini said.

12855	17048	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Jessica Leighton, the city's deputy commissioner of environmental health, said sloppy sanitation can attract rodents.
12856	17049	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The basic message is, you need to remove food sources," she said.
12857	17050	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"In restaurants, rodents are a symptom of poor sanitation."
12858	17051	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Eisenberg, the exterminator, said wiping out vermin is impossible.

12861	17054	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The company said construction in the building's basement apparently stirred up the rats.

12869	17063	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists in the Netherlands have uncovered what they believe is part of the military road that marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire from the middle of the first century A.D.
12870	17064	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Train company Prorail made the initial discovery during preparations to add extra rail lines in the city of Houten, 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Utrecht.
12871	17066	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and Prorail will complete an excavation of a short stretch in the coming weeks, and carry out exploratory digs to determine the further route of the road, the city said in a statement.
12872	17067	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Excavations of parts of the road, known as the "limes," are ongoing in other European countries and the U.N. is considering declaring it a world heritage site.
12873	17069	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Although the limes' course is known from ancient maps, archaeologists have been unable to locate it south of Utrecht and the stretch found in Houten is believed to have connected two forts: Fectio, modern Vechten, and Traiectum, modern Utrecht.
12874	17070	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Romans first entered this part of the Netherlands under Julius Caesar in the year 53 B.C.
12875	17072	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists have yet to determine a date for the road, which the city said is built on a sloping mound of sand and clay, interspersed with layers of gravel.
12876	17073	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	It was flanked by drainage channels and has wooden poles for reinforcement.
12877	17074	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Pottery shards were used as filler material in several places, which should aid in dating.
12878	17075	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	The discovery is the latest of several in the area of Utrecht.
12879	17076	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	In 2002, archaeologists found the remains of a watchtower on the Rhine where detachments of three or four soldiers would have served as lookouts.
12880	17077	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Near the tower, they found bones and other remains of food the soldiers ate and such objects as a spearpoint, a coin, an ax, a sickle and an ancient pen.
12881	17078	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	In 2003, archaeologists excavated a 25-meter long barge, complete with a covered living cabin and decorated chest with lock and key -- which led to the suggestion it may have been used by a paymaster to sail upriver carrying supplies to military camps and bases.

12894	17095	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The island EU nation, with a population of around 400,000, has rescued some 7,000 people in waters off its coast in the last five years, with scores picked up -- some clinging to tuna farm cages, others dead -- in May alone.
12895	17097	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The EU Commission president described these events as a "human tragedy for desperate people who are ruthlessly and unforgiveably exploited", and acknowledged the difficulties Malta faced.
12896	17098	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Many people in the rest of Europe were "simply unaware that the search and rescue area and jurisdiction of Malta is larger than the land mass of the United Kingdom, clearly disproportionate to its resources," he said.
12897	17099	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso said that the coordinated maritime patrols between member states launched last month would become a permanent fixture from next January to help patrol the 27-nation bloc's southern borders.
12898	17100	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"I set out today my intention that the European patrols network which started operation last May should become from January 2008 a permanent tool available at the request of member states to curb illegal immigration across the Mediterranean and along the south-east Atlantic coasts," he said.
12899	17101	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Migration would be a central theme of the EU-Africa summit later this year, he added, and the EU Commission would draw up practical guidelines for managing Europe's external border, covering search and rescue operations.
12900	17102	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"The commission cannot solve all the problems, not least (because) we don't have boats or planes.
12901	17103	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	But I recognise that more should be done, especially by member states," Barroso said.
12902	17104	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"Member states have planes, member states have boats, have resources which they can put at the disposal of a member state that has special difficulty.
12903	17105	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Some political resistance is yet to be overcome."
12904	17106	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the European Union expressed determination to save the lives of African migrants trying to reach its shores but struggled to find concrete ways to help Malta tackle the problem.

12906	17110	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	District livestock officials collected samples of some dead chickens from the area and sent those to Dhaka for laboratory test after large number of fowls of three farms died during the last few days.
12907	17111	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	As the avian influenza was detected, the district administration in presence of deputy commissioner Belayet Hossain and joint forces dumped the chickens under the ground.
12908	17112	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	The district administration also advised residents of 1 km square mile to refrain from eating chickens affected by bird flu.
12909	17113	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	The avian influenza virus was first detected in a poultry farm in Savar, about 30 km northwest of Dhaka, early in 2007.
12910	17114	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	Detections of avian influenza have been reported in several districts across the country in the last one month.
12911	17115	XIN_ENG_20080126.0223.LDC2009T13	At least 50, 000 fowls were killed and thousands of eggs were destroyed in the districts.

12914	17123	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It's a very fluid situation in Pakistan at the moment.
12915	17124	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It's primarily the external environment we're looking at and which we have raised some concerns over.
12916	17125	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	We will be monitoring that very closely."
12917	17127	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're in very close touch with the PCA (Professional Cricketers Association)," he said.
12918	17128	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Clearly, other boards around the world are in the same position.
12919	17129	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The safety and security of our players is paramount and we won't compromise on that."
12920	17132	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"But, unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyone's control."
12921	17134	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"The security firm of the ICC gave us (an) 'A' grade in the arrangements made during the Asia Cup," he said, adding that Pakistan is a "safe country to play cricket in."
12922	17136	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Our security advisers are very confident," Lorgat said.
12923	17137	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We know of no credible threat against the event or any players.
12924	17138	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The Asia Cup was held recently and there were no incidents.
12925	17139	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It was a pretty safe event."
12926	17140	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Yet concerns remain.
12927	17142	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There are many players, not just in Australia but all around the world, that are not comfortable with going to Pakistan at this time," Marsh said.
12928	17143	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"So, the sad part about all of this is that the Champions Trophy looks like it's going to disintegrate into a second-rate event, unfortunately."
12929	17145	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There isn't one player I have spoken to who is comfortable about traveling to Pakistan at the moment," Mills said.
12930	17146	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"From what we've seen from the various security reports compiled prior to the meeting in Dubai, there is no way you could consider Pakistan a safe workplace.
12931	17147	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're not in a position where we can compromise on this issue.
12932	17148	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	If we compromise on player safety for commercial considerations or politics, then in my view we might as well pack up our bags and go home."

12935	17155	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Later, during an appearance at a Greater Houston Partnership luncheon, Alvarez was asked what Chavez wants to hear from the new U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
12936	17156	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We are ready to respect Venezuela," Alvarez replied.
12937	17158	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez is spending several days in Texas on a visit he said has focused more on making community contacts than on the energy business, though he conceded that it's "impossible to have a completely non-oil visit to Texas."
12938	17160	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
12939	17162	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	In May, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took over operations of major oil projects that had been run by Houston-based ConocoPhillips, Irving-based Exxon Mobil, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp. and Paris-based Total.
12940	17164	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.
12941	17166	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	PDVSA absorbed their stakes, and the companies are negotiating compensation for what they gave up.
12942	17167	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chevron and Total agreed to stay on as PDVSA's minority partners.
12943	17169	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Analysts have valued the combined projects PDVSA took over at $25 billion to $30 billion.
12944	17171	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
12945	17172	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said in the meeting with the Chronicle that he isn't worried that the takeovers will chill future investment or participation from foreign companies.
12946	17174	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	This week PDVSA announced that Venezuela and Iran will collaborate to spend $4 billion on a joint Orinoco project.
12947	17175	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and Hispanics.
12948	17176	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
12949	17178	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts could change in midstream.
12950	17179	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, he said questions loom as to whether other companies have the know-how to successfully develop heavy oil projects and maximize production in the Orinoco, where estimated reserves could surpass those in Saudi Arabia.
12951	17180	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.
12952	17181	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"I think the government will have to recalibrate and re-evaluate its prospects unless it wants to run the risk of either pushing other companies out or failing to convince any new companies to step in."
12953	17183	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	That could prompt oil service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
12954	17184	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
12955	17186	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility.
12956	17187	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
12957	17188	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.
12958	17189	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He also said that during his visit, he would meet privately with officials of Chevron and Citgo.

12965	17197	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The company has been steadily departing markets where it doesn't hold a first or second-place position, notably divesting its mobile phones operations after being eclipsed by Nokia Corp.

12971	17203	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Each program entered the West Region semifinals of the NCAA tournament with starkly different styles.
12972	17204	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated on running and trapping.
12973	17205	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
12974	17206	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.

12997	17231	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is the erratic play of Collison, the point guard.

13026	17284	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat is still a matter of debate.
13027	17285	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives to keep former wheat acres in corn.
13028	17286	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Within a year, David Braaten, a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others near completion.
13029	17287	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.
13030	17288	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and oats.
13031	17289	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed, a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of Bismarck, the capital.
13032	17292	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	But wheat's biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned many farmers against it.
13033	17294	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.
13034	17295	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements, requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year.
13035	17296	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
13036	17297	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Research might solve many of wheat's problems, but commercial companies say the opportunities for profit are limited.
13037	17298	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
13038	17299	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
13039	17300	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is an expensive and time-consuming process.
13040	17301	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed year after year.
13041	17302	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
13042	17303	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without significant loss of yield.
13043	17305	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.
13044	17307	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"It's a joy to make a difference in the life of the growers," said Mergoum, who worked earlier in the international program that developed higher-yielding "green revolution" wheats.
13045	17308	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Glenn has proved resistant to scab, but it hasn't achieved universal acceptance among farmers.
13046	17309	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Don Strickler, a farmer in Euclid, Minn., gave it a try one year but stopped using it after finding that a lot of the kernels cracked when they were separated from the chaff during threshing.
13047	17310	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without other problems arising.
13048	17311	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	James A. Anderson, a plant breeder at the University of Minnesota, predicted that the seed companies will continue to make inroads in wheat country with new kinds of corn and soybeans.

13050	17313	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to get whatever acreage they can and sell more of their seed."

13078	17354	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch already plans to shed 1,185 jobs -- mostly by offering early retirement and not filling vacancies.

13112	17404	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A kind of Velib' behavior has emerged, especially at the morning rush, with people swiftly checking for bikes in the best condition: tires inflated, chains still attached, baskets unstolen.

13143	17452	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Eleven people, including a U.S. Secret Service informant, have been charged in connection with the hacking of nine major retailers and the theft and sale of more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
13144	17453	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The data breach is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which said the suspects were charged with conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft.
13145	17455	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The indictment returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston alleges that the suspects hacked into the wireless computer networks of retailers including TJX Cos., BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp
13146	17456	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW and set up programs that captured card numbers, passwords and account information.
13147	17457	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"They used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data, which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves," Attorney General Michael Mukasey said at a news conference.
13148	17458	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"And in total, they caused widespread losses by banks, retailers, and consumers."
13149	17459	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Mukasey called the total dollar amount of the alleged theft "impossible to quantify at this point."
13150	17460	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said that while most of the victims were in the United States, officials still haven't identified all the people who had a card number stolen.
13151	17461	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised," he said.
13152	17462	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Sullivan said the alleged thieves weren't computer geniuses, just opportunists who used a technique called "wardriving," which involved cruising through different areas with a laptop and looking for accessible wireless Internet signals.
13153	17463	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Once they located a vulnerable network, they installed so-called "sniffer programs" that captured credit and debit card numbers as they moved through a retailer's processing networks.
13154	17464	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The information was stored on two servers in Ukraine and Latvia -- one with more than 25 million credit and debit card numbers and another with more than 16 million numbers, Sullivan said.
13155	17465	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The heist was a black eye for retailers like TJX.
13156	17466	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The company initially disclosed the data breach in January 2007 but said a few months later that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to possible fraud in a breach of its computer systems that began in July 2005.
13157	17467	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Court filings by some banks that sued TJX put the number of cards affected at more than 100 million, based on estimates by officials with Visa and MasterCard, who were deposed in the suit.
13158	17468	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, TJX said it won support from MasterCard-issuing banks for a settlement that will pay them as much as $24 million to cover costs from the breach.
13159	17469	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A similar agreement reached last November with Visa-card issuing banks set aside as much as $40.9 million to help banks cover costs including replacing customers' payment cards and covering fraudulent charges.
13160	17470	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	According to the indictments unsealed Tuesday, three of the defendants are U.S. citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from China and one is from Belarus.
13161	17471	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	One individual is known only by an alias online, and his place of origin is unknown.
13162	17472	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	At a press briefing in San Jose, California, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the non-U.S. citizens under indictment were part of an international stolen credit and debit card ring.
13163	17473	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The ring operated in mainly in Eastern Europe, the Phillipines, China and Thailand, and the alleged foreign conspirators remained outside the U.S., Chertoff said.
13164	17474	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The thefts were criminal actions committed for the personal gain of the defendants, who investigators did not consider a national security threat, Chertoff said.
13165	17475	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, their alleged crimes demonstrated the weaknesses of cybersecurity in the U.S.
13166	17476	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Today's indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every American faces in the 21st century -- the fact that each individual's greatest asset is their names, their identity," Chertoff said.
13167	17477	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In the Boston indictment, the alleged ringleader Albert "Segvec" Gonzalez of Miami was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy.
13168	17478	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez, who is in custody in New York, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all the charges.
13169	17480	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"That was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped," he said.
13170	17481	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	But he said the Secret Service later found out that Gonzalez had also been feeding criminals information about ongoing investigations -- even warning off at least one person.
13171	17482	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, we weren't happy that a person working for us as an informant was double-dealing," Mark Sullivan said.
13172	17484	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	They are charged with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data.
13173	17485	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Yastremskiy was arrested when he traveled to Turkey on vacation in July 2007.
13174	17488	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is in custody awaiting the resolution of extradition proceedings.

13176	17490	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A Justice Department spokeswoman said those three suspects, together with five others, are still at large.
13177	17491	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Officials did not give an arraignment date for Gonzalez.

13179	17493	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The charges stemmed from allegations that they hacked into a national restaurant chain's computerized cash registers and stole credit card information from customers.

13186	17500	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	It took a real-world crisis to wrench the White House race away from lipstick and pigs, with the Wall Street meltdown offering a sudden chance of a breakout moment for Barack Obama or John McCain.
13187	17501	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	After feuding all year over who could best handle a "3 am" call in the White House, the candidates faced a real judgment call when iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, sparking global stocks contagion.
13188	17505	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Their focus on issues issue contrasted with last week's gutter politics which included the McCain camp accusing Obama of insulting Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin, in a distortion of his use of the phrase "lipstick on a pig."
13189	17506	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama Monday immediately blamed eight years of Republican rule for the crisis, and predicted McCain would bring four more years of the same.
13190	17507	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	His Republican rival promised a regulatory reform drive in Wall Street, and said Obama would hike taxes and thwart economic growth.
13191	17508	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	But the Arizona Senator, who now leads his rival by a few points in national polls, opened himself up by declaring in Florida that the fundamentals of the economy were "strong."
13192	17510	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama asked at a campaign event in Colorado, as his supporters immediately branded McCain as out of touch and the inheritor to the Bush administration's economic legacy.
13193	17511	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the campaign Obama tried to capitalize on a comment by McCain that he did not know as much about the economy as he should.
13194	17513	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama and the Democrats seem yet to have reached the levels of empathy with hard-pressed voters achieved by his primary rival Hillary Clinton, or famously by her husband Bill Clinton in the 1992 campaign.
13195	17514	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"It is amazing that they have not been able to do that to this point," said Dowdle.
13196	17515	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	An ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month found 47 percent of voters trusted Obama to run the economy and 42 percent trusted McCain.
13197	17516	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	The Democrat had enjoyed a much wider lead on the issue for much of this year.
13198	17517	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain has struggled to navigate away from Bush economic legacy, and Democrats argue that his economic policies barely differ from those of the current president.
13199	17521	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama's short career as a public servant has been defined by pessimism, defeatism and weakness in the face of the great challenges of our time," he said.
13200	17524	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain is expected to press home that argument against Obama in three potentially decisive presidential debates beginning on September 26.
13201	17525	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama supporters will see the forums as his best chance to finally thrust home a winning message on the economy.

13216	17542	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here said this is the formal end of the first step of a seven-step roadmap to democracy.
13217	17543	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a general election to produce parliament representatives and formation of a new democratic government in line with the government's seven-step roadmap.
13218	17544	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
13219	17546	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic system economically.
13220	17547	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
13221	17548	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
13222	17549	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Besides, armed forces members are also to be nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and border affairs.
13223	17550	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The defense services commander-in-chief will represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the right to take over and exercise state power in case of state emergency that could cause disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national sovereignty.
13224	17551	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
13225	17552	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	It will not allow foreign troops to be deployed in the country.
13226	17553	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
13227	17554	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
13228	17555	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
13229	17556	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	As a result, the national convention turned into a status of long adjournment from March 1996 to April 2004.
13230	17557	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Aimed at realization of national reconciliation and pushing forward the process of democratization, the military government announced the seven-step roadmap in August 2003, which mainly include the reconvening of national convention, drafting of new state constitution, holding of national referendum on drafted constitution, sponsoring general election and formation of new civilian government.
13231	17558	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
13232	17560	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of the constitutional national convention but did not mention the duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the time table about when the national referendum on the drafted constitution will be held.
13233	17561	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here commented that Myanmar's constitution-drafting process is still not finished yet and the public concern will naturally focus on the country people's decision on the drafted constitution in the upcoming national referendum.

13235	17565	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang said the method of cultivation allows rice fields to be playgrounds for ducks, which eat insects and apple snails that harm rice crops and whose excrement can be used as organic fertilizer.
13236	17566	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	But since Fangjung Rice Plant launched the program to use ducks in rice farming in 2006, only six farmers have participated in it, with the total farmland using this method reaching only three hectares, Huang said.
13237	17567	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique organic farming technique, Huang said she is trying to get produce generated under the program certified as organic produce.
13238	17568	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She said she is confident this can be achieved within one year.
13239	17569	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang explained that three years is the minimum time it takes for a farm's produce to pass organic examinations.
13240	17570	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations.
13241	17571	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	They have to grow the strain selected by the rice production plant and cannot use any pesticides or chemical fertilizers, Huang said.
13242	17572	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production volume to quality is the most difficult part of promoting the farming technique, even though farmers know that it is a good technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.
13243	17573	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded in 1926.
13244	17574	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks beside their rice farms.
13245	17575	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Three farmers who cultivate a 1.68-hectare plot of land together have had to raise about 500 ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang said.
13246	17576	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in carrying out the mission, but found that ducks are the most effective, " Huang said.
13247	17577	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	All produce grown on farmland using this special technique have passed pesticide tests, she emphasized.
13248	17578	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many bugs around, they are still beneficial to farmland.
13249	17579	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She added that having ducks in rice fields is also a good way to attract tourists to the area.

13251	17585	XIN_ENG_20071031.0387.LDC2009T13	According to official statistics, Myanmar and Vietnam had a bilateral trade volume of 70.5 million U.S. dollars in the fiscal year 2006-07 which ended in March, up from 54.4 million dollars in 2005-06 .
13252	17586	XIN_ENG_20071031.0387.LDC2009T13	Of the total, Myanmar's exports to Vietnam took up 58.23 million dollars, while its imports from Vietnam amounted to 12.27 million dollars, enjoying a trade surplus of 45.96 million dollars.
13253	17587	XIN_ENG_20071031.0387.LDC2009T13	The two countries are striving to raise the bilateral trade volume to 100 million dollars in 2007-08, according to a decision by the Myanmar-Vietnam Joint Trade Committee.

13283	17625	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Walter Smith has urged his Rangers players to forget the disappointment of their UEFA Cup final defeat here on Wednesday and concentrate on completing the domestic treble that remains in their grasp.
13284	17628	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"Obviously it will be difficult to judge how much the disappointment takes out of the players.
13285	17629	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But what is at stake for them is that we have an opportunity with four games to go to win two trophies so I would hope that we can overcome the disappointment we have suffered.
13286	17630	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"If we win our next three games in the SPL and become champions we will be happy."
13287	17631	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' cause was not helped by the refusal of SPL bosses to extend the season, which would have enabled Smith's men to avoid playing last weekend, as Zenit were able to do.
13288	17632	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But Smith refused to blame the intense end-of-season schedule for his side's wilting at the end of what was their 64th match of a campaign that started in late July last year.
13289	17633	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think that had any influence on the result," Smith said.
13290	17634	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"The players tonight were ready to play and we were just coming into the match when they scored and that first goal changed the whole complexion of the game."
13291	17636	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Konstantin Zyrianov added a close-range second in stoppage time to make sure Zenit emulated the achievement of 2005 winners CSKA Moscow and condemned the tens of thousands of Rangers supporters who had descended on Manchester to a miserable journey back to Scotland.
13292	17637	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Arshavin, who is being tipped as a potential star of Euro 2008, was also involved in the build-up to the second goal and Smith acknowledged that a player of his guile was something Rangers lacked.
13293	17638	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I think we have missed a little bit of that all through the year -- somebody who can do something a little bit different.
13294	17639	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have a good work ethic in this team and it has taken them a long way but in a few games we have lacked someone to give us a little bit more creativity.
13295	17640	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think anyone, myself or the players, thought this season would lead to a European final.
13296	17641	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"So you have to give them credit for what they have achieved against a lot of good European sides."
13297	17642	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith believes Zenit are good enough to go on to make an impact in the Champions League next season, although Advocaat admitted he could face a battle to keep his squad together.
13298	17643	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I have no doubt that some players will go and then you have to start again.
13299	17644	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	It is always the problem with success.
13300	17645	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We already sold Martin Skrtl to Liverpool but you have to keep players like that if you want to become even better.
13301	17646	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"It is not only Arshavin we have to keep.
13302	17647	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	There are other players who are very important to us.
13303	17648	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have to try to keep this team together and add three or four players so that we can rotate.
13304	17649	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	At the moment it is always the same 12 to 14 players who play but to go to the next level you need more than that."
13305	17650	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Zenit were denied a blatant penalty on the stroke of half-time, when Kirk Broadfoot handled in the area, but overall Rangers did a good job of containing Zenit until 18 minutes from the end.
13306	17651	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith's men, who were showing signs of fatigue, were partly to blame for their own downfall having lost possession from their own throw on the left.
13307	17652	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The ball was quickly worked forward by the Russians and Denisov played a deft one-two with Arshavin before sliding the ball past Neal Alexander and Zyrianov wrapped things up in stoppage time.
13308	17653	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Football: Unstoppable Ronaldo keeps United on a roll
13309	17655	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Wayne Rooney, twice, and Carlos Tevez were the players to benefit from the winger's service in a game that confirmed the scale of the task facing Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to overhaul the reigning champions.
13310	17656	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	This was the perfect response to Arsenal's impressively resilient victory at Bolton earlier in the day that appeared to revive the London club title claims.
13311	17657	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That win meant United kicked off just three points ahead of Arsene Wenger's side and, with Chelsea set to face Middlesbrough the following day, anything less than three points would have given the three-way battle at the head of the table a new twist.
13312	17658	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	As it was Ferguson's side didn't just get the job done, they triumphed in a style that will undoubtedly suggested there is little chance of them throwing away such a commanding lead at this stage of the season.
13313	17660	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
13314	17661	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But from the moment Ronaldo produced an impudent back-heel flick from ten yards out to divert the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and beyond Scott Carson for the 17th minute opener, United were almost completely in control.
13315	17662	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed home.
13316	17663	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Villa already looked a beaten side but they did at least rally after half-time, applying a brief period of pressure and, after Rooney had missed a sitter at the other end, should have scored when substitute Shaun Maloney pulled the ball wide when clear on Tomasz Kuzsczak's goal.
13317	17664	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
13318	17665	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60 seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.
13319	17670	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	The clashes spread to other Shiite regions of Iraq, killing and wounding hundreds of people.
13320	17672	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"They have also stopped people from attending Friday prayers.

13325	17680	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	There is a hidden political agenda," said Falah Shanshal.

13358	17720	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	There are some things that a girl just can't get along without on the big day.
13359	17721	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	But even the necessities can be made nice:
13360	17722	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Specs
13361	17723	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Those funky, chunky black specs that define you as a cultural creative in the office might be a bit too jarring for your wedding get-up.
13362	17724	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you need eyeglasses, are disinclined to wear contact lenses and think prenuptial vision correction surgery falls into the category of budget-buster, think about picking out some special frames for the big day.
13363	17725	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Heidi Tanner, manager of DisRespectacles in Denver, says some women can pull off an over-the-top frame, but she typically steers brides-to-be toward frames that are "a little more minimal, softer and feminine."
13364	17726	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Pick from a lineup of new jeweled frames, or select a vintage frame.
13365	17727	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Among Tanner's favorites at the moment is a white Vivia frame, studded with silver sparkles, handmade in France by Francis Klein.
13366	17728	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	They run about $515, not including lenses.
13367	17729	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Vintage frames are less expensive, averaging around $125 in the eyeglasses store, and are way less expensive if you shop at garage sales or thrift stores.
13368	17730	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Expect to spend about $160 for lenses.
13369	17731	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And, yes, you do need the anti-reflective coatings -- you don't want flash photography to bounce off your glasses.
13370	17732	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Getting your frames fit with new lenses can be done pretty quickly, but Tanner recommends getting the work done a few weeks in advance, just to be on the safe side.
13371	17733	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Old frames can be very fragile, so if you've chosen vintage frames, select an optician who has experience with old specs and will handle your glasses with lots of TLC.

13373	17735	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Whether you're veiling up or approaching your vows bareheaded, chances are good you'll want some kind of hair ornament, possibly including fresh blooms.
13374	17736	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you're thinking of adding flowers to your 'do, make sure to do a trial run with the hairstylist.

13376	17739	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If a test run isn't in the budget, spend time going over -- in excruciating detail -- what you want from a headpiece.

13385	17748	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	See a custom jeweler.
13386	17749	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Colin Miller, production manager at Master Goldsmith in Boulder, says that if your vintage piece is a good quality metal, fixing its style flaws is relatively simple.
13387	17750	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And don't be afraid to ask for help with costume jewelry.
13388	17751	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Some old costume pieces are very high quality, and the technology that jewelers use today -- such as laser welding tools -- make changes less risky.
13389	17752	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Miller likes working with vintage pieces because he gets to see work from other eras and other cultures.
13390	17753	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	He recently restored a jeweled, gold-filled locket for a client.
13391	17754	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"It was not special in terms of materials, but it was very sentimental."

13401	17765	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	For her own wedding last year, Burja wore a patent- leather- covered wedge with a snake upper in off-white.

13408	17782	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he sees as improved security.
13409	17783	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"So the issue is are we at the point where we can continue to make security progress with X number of forces?"
13410	17784	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said.
13411	17785	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
13412	17786	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003.
13413	17789	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
13414	17790	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the conditions on the ground, not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media," the president said.
13415	17791	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
13416	17792	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
13417	17793	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Gates said the general view was that security has improved not just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of the surge.
13418	17794	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some (areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape," Gates told reporters.

13424	17808	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	KIRKUK, Iraq
13425	17809	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
13426	17810	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
13427	17811	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	No, Najat told the caller.
13428	17812	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after hanging up, he wryly revealed the deeper truth about Kirkuk, combustible for its mix of ethnicities floating together on a sea of oil: The Kurds already control it.
13429	17813	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It's true," Najat said.
13430	17814	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
13431	17816	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The explosive quarrel over the city is one major barrier to creating stable political structures in the rest of Iraq.
13432	17817	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Beyond that, it demonstrates that despite a recent decline in violence, Iraq's unsettled ethnic and regional discord could still upend directives emanating from Baghdad and destabilize large regions of the country -- or even set off a civil war.
13433	17818	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	This month, legislation in the national parliament to set the groundwork for crucial provincial elections collapsed in a bitter dispute over Kirkuk, as Arabs and Turkmens demanded that the Kurds be forced to cede some of their power here.
13434	17819	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But with the Kurds having already consolidated their authority in Kirkuk, there seemed little chance -- short of a military intervention -- of that happening.
13435	17820	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city.
13436	17821	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In addition to the provincial government and command of the police, the Kurds control the Asaish, the feared undercover security service that works with the U.S. military and, according to Asaish commanders, U.S. intelligence agencies.
13437	17822	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the best intelligence.
13438	17823	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
13439	17825	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago, rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
13440	17828	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All in all, U.S. officials say they believe, far more people were killed and wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
13441	17829	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
13442	17831	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.

13444	17835	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs and Turkmens.
13445	17837	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"The Asaish are saying they will annex Kirkuk by force, and that is terrifying people."
13446	17838	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
13447	17839	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an outbreak of ethnic fighting.
13448	17840	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The city's Arabs, said Khalil, "will not stay handcuffed by Kurdish actions."
13449	17841	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Kurdish families were driven out of Kirkuk, replaced by Arabs as part of his drive to obtain a firmer political grip on the enormous oil reserves here.

13451	17843	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
13452	17844	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan region.
13453	17845	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	They also warn that any plan involuntarily stripping them of power will be harshly contested.
13454	17851	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The troops took up positions in the city.
13455	17852	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
13456	17853	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major Arab security force after the July 28 violence.
13457	17854	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military commander here, Col. David Paschal, said he feared that if Baghdad sent in additional troops, Kurdish leaders would retaliate by sending in their own militia from northern Iraq, creating a potentially disastrous confrontation.
13458	17855	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I just saw this continued escalation of force happening," he said.
13459	17856	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Baghdad is expected to withdraw the troops, according to U.S. commanders.
13460	17857	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said he blames all the political parties for inflaming tensions to serve their interests.
13461	17858	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.

13464	17861	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
13465	17862	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic, a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be seen standing in a sea of demonstrators.

13468	17865	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed.
13469	17867	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video captured the crowd furiously beating Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him!

13471	17871	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.
13472	17872	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authorities have sought to play down the intensity of the fight between the Kurds and the Turkmens, but Paschal said most of the casualties were sustained during the riot.
13473	17873	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since last summer.
13474	17874	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds attribute some of that improvement to the Asaish.
13475	17875	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are in direct contact with the people," said Hemin Shafiq, a 24-year-old policeman.

13484	17886	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	company claims best quarterly growth since 2001
13485	17888	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Second-quarter earnings at International Business Machines Corp. rose 12 percent and beat Wall Street forecasts Wednesday, largely on the strength of IBM's software division and improvement in its services unit.
13486	17889	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	From April through June, the Armonk, New York-based technology bellwether earned $2.26 billion (euro1.64 billion), $1.55 (euro1.12) per share, on revenue of $23.8 billion (euro17.27 billion).
13487	17890	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the comparable period last year, IBM earned $2.02 billion (euro1.47 billion), $1.30 (euro.94) per share, on revenue of $21.9 billion (euro15.89 billion).
13488	17891	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	This year's quarterly numbers were boosted $81 million (euro58.79 million), or 5 cents per share, from the sale of IBM's printing division to Ricoh Co.
13489	17892	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Without that gain, IBM would have earned $1.50 (euro1.09) per share, beating the estimate of $1.47 (euro1.07) expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
13490	17893	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Analysts were expecting revenue of $23.1 billion (euro16.76 billion).
13491	17894	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's overall sales growth of 9 percent in the second quarter would have been 6 percent if not for weakness in the dollar.
13492	17895	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Softness in the greenback makes deals done in other currencies translate into more dollars.
13493	17897	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The company's overall profit margins also increased slightly.
13494	17898	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's shares surged to multiyear highs this week after some analysts predicted IBM would exceed Wall Street's forecast.
13495	17899	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Before the earnings report came out Wednesday, IBM stock gained 31 cents to close at $111.08.
13496	17900	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In after-hours trading, shares gained $1.17.
13497	17901	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	One common gauge of IBM's health is services contract signings, because it foretells huge chunks of revenue that will be booked in future quarters.
13498	17902	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's services division inked $11.7 billion (euro8.49 billion) in contracts in the second quarter, compared with an unusually soft $9.6 billion (euro6.97 billion) a year ago.
13499	17903	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Revenue actually booked in the second quarter rose 10 percent to $13.1 billion (euro9.51 billion).
13500	17904	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's hardware division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $5.1 billion (euro3.7 billion), though it would have been flat if not for currency fluctuations.
13501	17905	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Software is IBM's smallest unit but accounts for an outsized portion of IBM's profit.
13502	17906	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	That has prompted the company to make dozens of acquisitions to bolster its security and business- management offerings, including this week's $161 million (euro116.84 million) deal for DataMirror Corp.
13503	17907	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM software revenue grew 13 percent to $4.8 billion (euro3.48 billion) in the second quarter, and pre-tax profit was $1.25 billion (euro0.91 billion), just slightly less than what the much bigger services arm generated.
13504	17908	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The sales growth would have been 9 percent at constant currency rates.
13505	17909	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the first six months of the year, IBM earned $4.11 billion (euro2.98 billion), $2.75 (euro2) per share, with revenue of $45.8 billion (euro33.24 billion).
13506	17910	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Those numbers all rose from the first half of 2006, when IBM showed profit of $3.73 billion (euro2.71 billion), $2.37 (euro1.72) per share, and revenue of $42.5 billion (euro30.84 billion).

13510	17916	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	After all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
13511	17917	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
13512	17918	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
13513	17919	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His animosity toward Microsoft has long been publicly understated and analytic in quality.
13514	17921	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
13515	17923	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"This looks like the beginning of the formal war."
13516	17924	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
13517	17925	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
13518	17928	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
13519	17929	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.
13520	17931	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"But for Eric, it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door."
13521	17933	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	He is every bit as comfortable talking about software scripting languages as he is discussing corporate strategy.
13522	17934	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior technology -- a common belief in Silicon Valley.
13523	17935	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
13524	17936	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt's concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, when it used its dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers and media players, according to people who have talked with Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not authorized to speak for him.
13525	17937	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	If Microsoft buys Yahoo, it will have more than an 80 percent share in markets like consumer e-mail accounts on the Web and instant messaging.
13526	17938	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
13527	17939	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.
13528	17940	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
13529	17941	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
13530	17942	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.
13531	17943	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It is an assault that is just getting under way.
13532	17944	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative desktop programs.
13533	17945	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
13534	17946	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"That's the dagger at the heart of Microsoft," said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and an author of the school's case study on Google.
13535	17947	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"And that's why Microsoft is so eager to have a response.
13536	17948	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
13537	17949	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whether Google's concerns about Microsoft are justified is unclear.
13538	17950	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
13539	17951	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The longer Microsoft's purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online business remains unsettled.
13540	17952	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft's use of the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN search service.
13541	17953	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for searching.
13542	17954	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
13543	17955	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service.
13544	17956	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was not anti-competitive.
13545	17957	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
13546	17958	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
13547	17959	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
13548	17960	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the two powerful companies have different business models that seek proprietary advantage in different places.
13549	17961	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
13550	17962	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court," he said.
13551	17963	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The big software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows monopoly by stifling rivals.
13552	17964	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem."
13553	17965	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"At Google," Schmidt added, "we had a long conversation about, if we became a big company, how could we avoid that.
13554	17966	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of technical things we can do and have done.
13555	17967	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data.
13556	17968	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is important because if" you can move your data from Google, you always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google.
13557	17969	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is absolutely not true in Microsoft's history."
13558	17970	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google is hoping that Microsoft's past will hamper its effort to become more formidable in the online business.
13559	17971	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.

13561	17973	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Diagnosed cases of cancer rose by 10 percent in Europe over two years, an increase attributable to the continent's ageing population, the effects of smoking and better screening for breast cancer, doctors reported on Wednesday.

13577	17992	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	So I went with him hoping to protect him."
13578	17993	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The line was disconnected three times during Hua's conversation, a sign that authorities were monitoring the telephone.

13604	18033	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered a Texas doctor and his wife on Friday not to distribute videotaped footage of Anna Nicole Smith's breast augmentation surgery in 1994.
13605	18034	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The order settles alawsuit filed last year by Howard K. Stern, the executor of Smith's estate, who was trying to stop Dr. Gerald Johnson and his wife from distributing the tapes of the former Playboy Playmate and reality star who died last year.
13606	18037	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Johnson has said he routinely records surgeries with the patient's permission and promises to keep the video confidential "during the patient's lifetime."
13607	18038	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	He said he gave Riccio permission to use the video after Smith died of a drug overdose in February 2007 in Florida.
13608	18039	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She was 39.
13609	18040	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Riccio's daughter edited the footage into a five-minute tape, scored with music similar to the theme from the film "Jaws."
13610	18041	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The Johnsons' Houston-based attorney, Gus Pappas, did not return a message seeking comment Friday.
13611	18042	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Larry Birkhead, who fathered Smith's daughter, called the video "truly disgusting" in a sworn declaration issued last year.
13612	18043	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	"It was clear that Anna Nicole was unconscious during the videotaping, and even more disturbing, the videotape focused on areas of her nude body that were unrelated to the location of the surgery," he said in the declaration.
13613	18044	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern's attorney, Vivian Thoreen, said all the tapes have been accounted for under the judge's previous orders.

13617	18049	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Times may be tough in the real world.
13618	18050	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Not in Hollywood.
13619	18051	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	As it usually does during economic downturns, the movie business has come on strong, expected to set a summer revenue record of about $4.2 billion from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers.
13620	18052	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	That would put Hollywood a fraction ahead of the previous record of $4.18 billion in summer 2007, though accounting for inflation, the actual number of tickets sold -- about 587 million -- is down 3.5 percent.
13621	18053	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Still, given the sluggish economy, studio executives are happy their business held up so well.
13622	18054	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	It's almost a tradition dating back to the Depression: When the economy goes sour, the escapism and relative cheapness of a night at the movies is an attractive prospect for audiences.
13623	18055	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"Let's face it.
13624	18057	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	The behemoth of summer was the Warner Bros.
13625	18058	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman sequel "The Dark Knight," whose haul -- $500 million and counting -- amounted to nearly one-eighth of overall Hollywood revenues.
13626	18059	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" passed "Star Wars" to rank No. 2 on the all- time domestic revenue chart, behind only "Titanic" at $600.8 million.
13627	18060	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman mania already was high as production wrapped last fall, but it grew to a fever after Heath Ledger, who co-stars as the Joker, died in January.
13628	18061	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"We would not be looking at a $4 billion summer if not for `The Dark Knight,'" said Paul Dergarabedian, Media By Numbers president.
13629	18062	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"In this case, one film made a huge difference."
13630	18063	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and four other superhero tales -- "Hancock," Paramount's "Iron Man," and Universal's "The Incredible Hulk" and "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" -- rang up $1.25 billion, 30 percent of the summer box office.
13631	18064	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Add in the $315 million take for Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and it's clear that audiences were looking for pure adventure this summer.
13632	18065	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	On the family front, the animated tales "WALL-E" from Disney and "Kung Fu Panda" from DreamWorks both topped $200 million.
13633	18066	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	There was a healthy dose of chick flicks during the male-dominated summer with Warner's "Sex and the City" and Universal's "Mamma Mia!"
13634	18067	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	-- both $100 million hits.
13635	18068	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Raunchy comedy also packed in crowds with the R-rated hits "Tropic Thunder" from Paramount and "Step Brothers" and "Pineapple Express," both from Sony.
13636	18069	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Some major flops accompanied the successes.
13637	18070	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Eddie Murphy bombed with his sci-fi comedy "Meet Dave" from 20th Century Fox, as did Mike Myers with Paramount's comedy "The Love Guru."
13638	18071	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Warner's family-action tale "Speed Racer" and 20th Century Fox's sci-fi sequel "The X-Files: I Want to Believe" also crashed and burned.
13639	18072	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Yet most big studio films delivered, finding both commercial success and better-than-usual reaction from critics, who typically tear many summer blockbusters to shreds.
13640	18073	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and "Iron Man" earned some of the best reviews ever for summer popcorn flicks, the acclaim helping to keep the theaters packed.
13641	18078	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	The surgery is being performed at a clinic in Munich, Germany, said Gordana Grbic.
13642	18079	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Racan, who heads the Social Democrats, the strongest opposition party, announced two weeks ago that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his right shoulder.
13643	18080	APW_ENG_20070212.0647.LDC2009T13	Further checkups showed the primary cancer was on his left kidney and had spread to his shoulder.

13649	18090	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
13650	18091	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer does not offer health coverage.
13651	18092	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She said she had purchased private insurance, but dropped it last summer when she turned 35.
13652	18093	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
13653	18094	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Most people say 22, but thanks,'' Childress responded amid laughter from the audience.
13654	18095	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
13655	18096	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy Childers can better afford insurance?''
13656	18097	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush asked.
13657	18098	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president has proposed making medical insurance premiums deductible for all Americans, up to $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for individuals.
13658	18099	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Currently, employers can deduct health- care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot.
13659	18100	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses.
13660	18101	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher.
13661	18103	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Democrats, who took control of both chambers of Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become more affordable for the self-employed.
13662	18105	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns.
13663	18106	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Instead, they favor a tax credit for premiums, which they say would help all taxpayers regardless of their filing status.
13664	18110	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Tenor Placido Domingo peppered his classical repertoire with a crowd-pleasing array of popular music and even donned a mariachi suit and sang along with the audience, smoothing over controversy surrounding his Saturday concert at the Mayan pyramids of Chichen Itza.
13665	18112	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo and Martinez also joined forces on a thundering, majestic tribute to the Mayan ruins in "The Silver Moon of Chichen Itza," by Lorena Tassinari, which he called "a kind of Mayan hymn."
13666	18114	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins.
13667	18115	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The concert's name is a reference to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.
13668	18116	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is marvelous to be here," Domingo said during a break.
13669	18117	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is an honor for us to have a concert like this," said Armando de Leon from the nearby city of Merida.

13671	18119	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the site will be damaged.
13672	18120	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	This is a controlled event," Segovia said.
13673	18122	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and activists have complained that concerts like Saturday's expose ruin sites to additional damage and degrade their cultural significance by treating them as mere backdrops.
13674	18124	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But it faces increasing pressure from state governors to promote ruins which, critics argue, are already swamped with tourists.
13675	18125	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Officials did impose limits on stage and seating structures and the number of spectators for Domingo's concert, ensuring that it would be smaller than tenor Luciano Pavarotti's 1997 appearance at Chichen Itza, which drew 17,000.
13676	18126	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Since then, more than a half dozen concerts have been held at or near the ruins.
13677	18127	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Despite intermittent drops of rain, Domingo opened masterfully with the inspiring "O Souverain" from Massenet's Le Cid.

13728	18194	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 40 percent of males and 16 percent of females who take cocktails of anti-AIDS drugs for their HIV infections develop fat deposits in the stomach, neck and cheeks.
13729	18195	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Called visceral fat, it is associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.
13730	18196	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Such patients typically have abnormally low levels of growth hormone and researchers had hoped that replacing it with genetically engineered human growth hormone -- the same drug used to treat below normal growth rates and can be abused by athletes -- might reverse the effects.
13731	18197	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints.
13732	18198	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the hormone.
13733	18199	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half were given daily doses of about 0.33 milligrams of the hormone, well below the 2 to 4 milligrams used in previous studies.
13734	18200	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half the subjects were given a placebo.
13735	18201	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Over the 18 months of the study, stomach fat dropped by 8.5 percent in the patients receiving the hormone, compared to 1.6 percent in those receiving a placebo.
13736	18202	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The team did not study cardiovascular risk.
13737	18203	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial.
13738	18204	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon said that future clinical trials should include a diabetes drug, such as metformin, to minimize side effects.

13744	18210	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB, and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
13745	18211	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	At the end of six months, 16.3 percent of those who received nevirapine when they were already taking rifampicin for TB had treatment failure marked by high levels of HIV in their blood, compared to 8.3 percent of those who did not have TB.
13746	18212	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting.
13747	18213	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.

13750	18216	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	A third study looked at HIV treatment of injection drug abusers.
13751	18217	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Some researchers have claimed that treatment provides little benefit in this group because they are not sufficiently motivated to take their AIDS drugs regularly.
13752	18219	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant.
13753	18220	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
13754	18221	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.

13760	18234	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls global atomic trade.
13761	18235	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
13762	18236	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a foreign policy success.
13763	18237	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
13764	18239	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	New Delhi was reluctant to sign the deal before Bush inked the pact but pledged during Rice's visit to India late last week to do so soon after.

13804	18298	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Relatives back home say Utah gunman Sulejman Talovic's early life in the Balkans was marked by war, poverty and upheaval: the family fled by foot from Serb forces when Talovic was just 4 years old, and his grandfather was killed by a Serb bomb.
13805	18299	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Talovic was just a toddler when the war broke out in Bosnia in 1992.
13806	18300	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Serb troops laid siege to the tiny hamlet of Talovici in northeastern Bosnia, bombing it for a year before finally overrunning the village in March 1993, relatives said Thursday.
13807	18301	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"We were besieged and bombed day and night.
13808	18302	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We couldn't stick our noses out of the house," recalled cousin Redzo Talovic, 59.
13809	18303	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"At first we all hid from the shells, but later we gave up on life, didn't care and started coming out.
13810	18304	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	That's how later the shelling killed 20 people in the village," Rezdo Talovic said.
13811	18305	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sabira Talovic fled on foot with Sulejman, his three sisters and his grandfather, while her husband, Suljo, hid in the mountains with other men from the village, relatives said.
13812	18306	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Many left the village, only a few made it," said Murat Avdic, 54, a friend of the family.
13813	18307	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The mother and children, exhausted, desperate and hungry, made their way the to nearby enclave of Srebrenica -- also besieged, bombed and crowded with starving families like the Talovics.
13814	18308	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	One of the bombs killed Sulejman's grandfather but relatives say despite the conditions, they were a quiet, gentle and caring family.
13815	18309	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Those were really nice people, never argued with anybody about anything.
13816	18310	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	During the war, they shared the little food they had with others," said Sefko Talovic, 59, a distant relative.
13817	18311	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"His father helped other injured people flee when the village fell although he himself was injured too," he said.
13818	18312	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Later that year, Sabira Talovic and the four children were among the displaced rescued by the U.N.
13819	18313	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They made their way to the government-controlled town of Tuzla, impoverished but safe.
13820	18314	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I remember they arrived in 1993 on an overloaded U.N. truck and settled here in an empty house the owner had left," said former neighbor Zijad Cerkic in the Tuzla suburb of Bare.
13821	18315	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"They were very poor, they had lost everything, but they were very nice and quiet people," Cerkic said, recalling the young Sulejman as "a good child, always with a smile on his face."
13822	18317	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The massacre of civilians was Europe's worst since World War II.
13823	18318	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The family finally reunited in Tuzla later that year when a peace agreement brought an end to the war.
13824	18319	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	But the accord divided up the country, putting their native Talovici in the Serb-controlled half of the country -- and they did not dare return, relatives said.
13825	18321	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	In 1998, they joined family members already living in Utah.
13826	18323	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I spoke to his father on the phone almost every month since they left to the United States, and he said for the first time they have a decent life, they have a home, jobs and they were happy," said Redzo Talovic.
13827	18325	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The news came as a shock to his extended family back in Talovici.
13828	18326	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"When I heard his name on TV, I fainted.
13829	18327	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	I still can't believe what he did," said a cousin, Mina Talovic, 54.
13830	18328	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I remember him as a happy little boy sitting in my lap."
13831	18329	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Not in my wildest dreams could I have presumed Sulejman killed those people.
13832	18330	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	When I heard his name, I fell from the sofa," Redzo Talovic said.
13833	18331	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"What got into him?
13834	18332	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	This is what we are all asking ourselves.
13835	18333	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We are all in shock," he said.
13836	18334	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Avdic speculated that the teen had been traumatized by what he saw and experienced as a child of war.
13837	18335	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Up to 200,000 people were killed in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, and 1.8 million others lost their homes.
13838	18336	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I'm convinced the war did this in Utah," he said.
13839	18337	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"There cannot be any other reason."
13840	18338	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Relatives describe a clan scarred and scattered by a war that destroyed their lives and kept them far from home.
13841	18339	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Most of the homes in Talovici remain in ruins, including the house Suljo Talovic built a year before the war broke out.
13842	18340	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Most of the 30 original families living in Talovici fled -- most to Switzerland or to the U.S., said Sefko Talovic.
13843	18341	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Nobody even thought of returning into Serb land," he said.
13844	18342	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Only in 2000 a few of us visited Talovici for the first time.
13845	18343	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Everything was burned and destroyed."
13846	18344	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	In 2003, eight families returned home and fixed up their homes -- and Sulejman Talovic's family was talking about doing the same, relatives said.

13854	18354	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel threatened on Sunday to launch a major offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip as violence simmered around the impoverished territory days after the end of a truce with the Islamists.
13855	18355	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The two frontrunners in the race to become prime minister after a snap election in February both vowed to topple Hamas, which has run Gaza since violently seizing power there in June 2007.
13856	18359	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"Israel must react when it is fired upon, must re-establish its force of dissuasion and stop the rockets."
13857	18362	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"Right now we have to go from passive response to active assault."
13858	18366	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"It is obvious where we are heading in Gaza.
13859	18367	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The situation is intolerable but clear.

13861	18370	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some damage.
13862	18373	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Since then, Gaza militants have launched several dozen rockets, causing some damage and slightly wounding a handful of civilians, and Israel has retaliated with air strikes, killing one militant and several other Palestinians.

13866	18381	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Physically disabled persons in Nepal have expressed dissatisfaction over current political deadlock in the country while marking the International Day of Disabled 2007 on Monday.
13867	18382	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Various programs were organized throughout Nepal to celebrate the 16th International Disabled Day 2007 with the theme of Decent Work for People With Disabilities.
13868	18383	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	However, the disabled persons in Nepal are yet to be convinced if they are going to get decent work opportunity at the time when the country is going through a total mess due to disagreement among political parties.
13869	18384	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We expected representation from our community in the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) elections, but it seems like the political leaders have made up their mind to stick on with the interim parliament and keep on postponing the elections," said Chhaya Shrestha, one of the participants of the rally organized to mark the day told Xinhua.
13870	18385	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Lamenting over current coalition government's apathy towards disabled persons, Chhaya criticized the government for failing to offer them any opportunity after democracy was restored in the country.
13871	18386	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We hoped to see physically disabled persons representing us in CA elections but the current political deadlock has put us into doubt if the election is ever going to take place or not," Chhaya added.
13872	18387	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"The politicians only limit proportional representation and inclusive democracy in their speech," she added.
13873	18388	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Similarly, there are thousands of people, who became physically disabled after losing their limbs and body parts during a decade long insurgency, still languishing for government's attention.
13874	18390	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to the association's data, some 2,000 CPN-M combatants who were disabled during the decade long people's conflict are not getting enough attention from the government.
13875	18391	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Central member of the association Chitra Bahadur Gharti, who lost his right hand during the conflict, told Xinhua that some of the party cadres who lost their limbs and body parts during the conflict are currently languishing in seven different United Nations cantonments while those who can still provide assistance are still deployed in the field to carry out various party works.
13876	18392	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We feel that the welfare of disabled persons is possible only through the restructuring of the state," said Gharti, adding that the main objective of the party would be to provide health, education and employment to the disabled persons.
13877	18393	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He added that the CPN-M is providing skill oriented training to the disabled cadres at the cantonments.
13878	18396	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He said so far 118 nations have ratified the convention and requested 13 countries including Nepal to ratify it.
13879	18397	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Bennett noted, the majority of people with disabilities live in conditions of poverty, adding that "Access to decent work is the key to breaking that poverty trap, while the self sufficiency that work with fair pay and conditions brings enhances the dignity of the worker and contributes to the entire society and economy."
13880	18398	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to a press release issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO), of an estimated 650 million disabled people in the world, approximately 470 million are of working age.
13881	18399	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"There is a strong link between disability and poverty," the ILO report says.

13906	18437	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Losang Gyaltsen also collaborated with others in looting and burning an outlet of the garment brand Metersbonwe and a Snow Spider shoe store.
13907	18438	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Wu said an investigation of the two was still underway.
13908	18439	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The ministry has now made public four deadly arson cases -- those in a Yishion outlet, a motorcycle shop, the Playboy garment store and the Hongyu pants store -- that led to the deaths of 12 civilians.
13909	18440	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	According to the ministry spokesman, apart from the cases already known to the public, six more people were found to have been killed in the March 14 riots.
13910	18441	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	They are:
13911	18442	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He Jianshu, male, 60, Han ethnic group, from the southwest Sichuan Province

13914	18445	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	A male surnamed Gao, 30, Han ethnic group, from the northwest Gansu Province.
13915	18446	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Another two males killed in the riots have not yet been identified.
13916	18447	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Local police were making further investigations, Wu said.
13917	18448	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	To date, the deadly riot has claimed the lives of 18 civilians and one police officer.
13918	18449	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
13919	18450	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
13920	18451	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He said that police have captured the primary suspects who allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on March 14 in Lhasa.
13921	18452	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	"The suspects are closely connected with the Dalai clique," he said.
13922	18453	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique, Wu revealed.

13936	18471	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince's future hung on a thread on Saturday after his side side suffered a sixth successive Premiership defeat 3-0 to Wigan Athletic managed by former Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce.
13937	18472	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Defeat means that Blackburn - champions in 1996 - are second from bottom of the table and in danger of being relegated for the second time in their Premiership history, haivng been relegated under former Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd.
13938	18477	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	However, Wigan went desperately close to making it 3-0 in the 57th minute as leading scorer Amr Zaki unleashed a shot from close on the goal but it went wide.
13939	18478	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Dunn took time to get going after a long lay-off with an Achilles tendon injury but finally produced a shot worthy of Chris Kirkland making a save in the 66th minute.
13940	18479	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	It was Wigan, though, who deservedly extended their lead in the 77th minute as Cattermole drove home from just inside the area following anothe rgood piece of work by the seemingly tireless Valencia.
13941	18480	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Rovers did at the least have the final shot on target with Roque Santa Cruz forcing the excellent Kirkland into a fine save.

13948	18488	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Shareholders did not go screaming for the exits Friday after AMD, business software maker SAP AG and Murphy's Oil Corp. warned results will miss expectations.

13950	18490	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	And analysts say there are signs that companies might have been able to eke out double-digit gains during the last three months of 2006.
13951	18492	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Earnings are still strong coming out of a lot of sectors."
13952	18493	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	For instance, there's an old adage on Wall Street that "as goes Alcoa, goes the market."

13956	18497	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	There were 17 companies that beat expectations, six that met them and eight that reported results below projections.
13957	18498	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That matches the historical averages, Dropsey said.
13958	18499	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Of the 31 companies, those that have beaten expectations have done so by an average of 8 percent.
13959	18500	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	This is still well above the norm of a 3 percent rise, according to Thomson Financial.
13960	18501	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Measuring the pace of profit warnings has also been a good way to judge how the quarter will turn out.
13961	18502	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	As of Thursday, 156 companies pre-announced results -- 37 said they'd be above projections, 26 said they were in line with estimates, and 93 announced they would miss.
13962	18503	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Even adding AMD and other recent warnings, Wall Street is still faring slightly better than it did in the third quarter.

13964	18505	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Although these are extremely early indicators, it suggests the fourth quarter remains on par with the previous quarter.
13965	18506	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Although many on Wall Street don't expect profit growth to hit the 22 percent level seen in the S&amp

13967	18508	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Portfolio managers say what has come out so far hasn't been significantly negative or positive, and that double-digit growth is still achievable.
13968	18509	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"I'd be more concerned if you saw multiple warnings from the same industry," said Matt Kelmon, portfolio manager of the Kelmoore Strategy Funds.
13969	18510	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Every quarter for the past 18 quarters we've been waiting for this earnings slowdown, and it's just never come.
13970	18511	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	It might be a headline if it's not double digit, but we're still seeing really strong profits anyway."
13971	18513	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	He still sees resilient corporate earnings on the way.
13972	18514	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"The expectations for profit growth already were ratcheted down, but we're now seeing some leeway in that," he said.
13973	18515	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Even if you have a few of these disappointments like with AMD, that's still not enough to change expectations that profit will decelerate below expectations."

13988	18540	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Frank J. Ayd Jr., a psychiatrist who by studying his patients' responses to early antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs helped give birth to and nurture the field of psychopharmacology, died Monday in Baltimore.
13989	18541	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He was 87.
13990	18542	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
13991	18543	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd's clinical results were usually influential and sometimes stunning.
13992	18545	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd, who received the first permit from the Food and Drug Administration to use Thorazine to treat schizophrenia, found that many of the 300 patients he treated with the drugs no longer needed hospitalization in a specialized setting and could be treated in a general hospital or nursing home.
13993	18546	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He said 80 percent were usefully employed.
13994	18547	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported that his finding had "profound economic implications," because it offered a way to cut the $1 billion the nation was then spending on mental illness.
13995	18548	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It said many patients could receive immediate treatment and avoid long- term hospitalization.
13996	18549	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases.
13997	18550	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He tested his patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to new drugs, then quantified the results.
13998	18551	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This placed him at odds with the more impressionistic traditions of psychiatry, and more in tune with the biological approach favored by many European researchers.
13999	18552	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in an interview Thursday.
14000	18553	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was there at its inception as a scientific area of focused research."
14001	18554	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd worked at a time when there was considerably less government and academic regulation, and when clinicians were able to experiment more freely with emerging drugs to find good uses for them.
14002	18555	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and his contemporaries.
14003	18556	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd contributed to more than 50 books and wrote more than 400 articles.
14004	18557	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His "Ayd's Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology and the Neurosciences" is a standard reference.
14005	18559	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In 1966, he established his own journal, the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
14006	18560	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It changed its name last year to Psychopharm Review.
14007	18561	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in higher doses were even more effective.
14008	18562	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It emerged that the powerful antipsychotic drugs often had powerful side effects.
14009	18564	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo said.
14010	18565	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"This wasn't theoretical for him.
14011	18566	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This was about treating the patient with something that would help them."
14012	18567	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized mentally ill people being released without adequate support systems because of effective drugs.
14013	18568	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Janicak said Ayd tried to find ways to "give a voice" to the often inarticulate mentally ill.
14014	18569	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to equally strict analysis.
14015	18570	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	DePaulo said Ayd tested on his patients one of the first tricyclic antidepressants, an early and important class of drugs for severe depression.
14016	18571	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist.
14017	18573	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His residency in pediatrics was interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a veterans' hospital.
14018	18574	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	A biography prepared by the alumni association of his medical school said Ayd treated a wide array of veterans.
14019	18575	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Some were violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from cold.
14020	18576	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Once a patient stuffed his clothes full of newspaper and set himself on fire.
14021	18577	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd is quoted as saying in the biography.

14037	18596	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	Heading into this weekend's Olympic trials here, Thompson said the world record holder has come a long way since last year's world championships when he struggled home in seventh place in the 1500m.
14038	18598	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people in Australia wondered whether Grant would continue on swimming after the world championships last year, or whether he could get back to his best," Thompson told a press conference here ahead of Saturday's Olympic trials.
14039	18599	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"I would suggest, though, we'll be waiting for the Olympic Games to see Grant at his absolute, absolute best, but he may surprise us all again."
14040	18601	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"I don't think we should ever doubt a champion like Grant," he said.
14041	18602	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"He's certainly of great value to our team.
14042	18603	AFP_ENG_20080320.0477.LDC2009T13	"As the team captain he may only talk to the team once or maybe twice... but what he does in the pool is something that is very important to our team and he's a great leader without standing up and talking about it, and just leading by his example.

14047	18608	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Two more suspects in China's tainted milk scandal were set to go on trial Tuesday, bringing the number to 17 who are facing court over the nation's worst food safety case in years.
14048	18609	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Brothers Geng Jinping and Geng Jinzhu were scheduled to be tried for making and selling food additives laced with the chemical melamine, the China News Service said.
14049	18610	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	At least six babies in China died this year and 294,000 fell ill after drinking milk laced with melamine, which is normally used to make plastic.
14050	18611	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The chemical was mixed into watered-down milk to make it appear richer in protein, but it caused severe kidney and urinary tract problems in babies who drank contaminated milk powder.
14051	18613	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Officials at the court in northern Shijiazhuang city refused to comment on the proceedings, but the China News Service said notices of Tuesday's trials were posted at the courthouse.
14052	18614	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	On Monday, nine people suspected of trading or producing the tainted additives went on trial in Shijiazhuang and surrounding districts, while five others were tried on Friday last week.
14053	18615	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	In China, trials often last just one day and verdicts are announced soon after.
14054	18616	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The verdicts in the milk trials will be "announced at an appropriate time," state press reports said, giving no other details.
14055	18620	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The group was once one of China's leading dairy producers but last week filed for bankruptcy due to the losses it incurred over the scandal.

14065	18638	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at a request last December from USADA attorney Travis Tygart for more tests on "B" portions of cleared "A" samples from Labaratoire National Depistage de Dopage's (LNDD) laboratory at Chatenay-Malabry.
14066	18639	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at the notion of retesting samples he considers tainted at the very center whose procedures he is challenging in an appeal of his doping positive to USADA.
14067	18640	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	That hearing is set for May 14.
14068	18641	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"They got it wrong the first time and they're trying to get it wrong again," Landis said in the statement.
14069	18642	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I am very concerned regarding the LNDD's handling of my samples over the last six months as well as the Anti-Doping Agencies' complete and consistent disregard of their own rules and procedures.
14070	18643	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"With the steady stream of news flow regarding serious problems at the LNDD, it's impossible to understand USADA's motivation for this move unless it's simply another way to drain my resources in this fight to clear my name.
14071	18644	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"My message to USADA and the LNDD is this testing should have been done right the first time."
14072	18645	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis argues his stage 17 positive came from a contaminated sample that LNDD continued to process in violation of World Anti- Doping Agency protocols.
14073	18646	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I have not taken testosterone or any other performance enhancing substance," Landis said.
14074	18647	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis has agreed not to race in France this season, giving him no chance to defend the crown that could be stripped from him if the positive dope test stands.
14075	18648	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I'm 100 percent confident that if best practice in process and technology were applied to testing my sample back in July, I would be racing my bike this season," Landis said.
14076	18649	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	While critics could argue that if Landis had nothing to hide, he has no reason to object to more testing of samples that were clear, Landis argues the re-test move would violate WADA and International Cycling Union rules.
14077	18650	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's request for further analysis of "B" samples is in clear violation the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code and Union Cyclist International (UCI) rules and is unprecedented in athlete anti-doping cases," the statement said.
14078	18651	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's illegal initiative would also cause the Landis team to expend unnecessary resources to halt a clearly prohibited activity - resources that have already been unduly and unfairly stretched by the ADA's unethical approach to their pursuit of unsubstantiated allegations against Landis."
14079	18652	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis' legal team claims to have been denied full access to details of his results "and has no reason to believe that it would be provided with the results of any further tests", the statement said.
14080	18653	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis attorney Maurice Suh expects it would not receive documentation from any proposed re-testing.
14081	18654	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"Illegal re-testing of these cleared samples is designed to further injure Floyd by costing him and his team substantial time and money, more deeply invading his privacy and destroying evidence that may later on be valuable in his defense," Suh said.
14082	18655	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA continues to dramatically demonstrate that they have no interest in providing Floyd with a fair and just outcome to this process."

14084	18658	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp.
14085	18659	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	PLC. reported narrowing second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
14086	18660	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Revenues rose 30 percent to US$245.6 million (euro156.6 million) in the April-June quarter, chiefly because of Tysabri, which is produced and distributed in alliance with U.S. drugmaker Biogen Idec Inc.
14087	18661	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan cut its losses nearly in half to US$71.5 million (euro45.6 million), compared to a US$141.1 million loss in the second quarter of 2007.
14088	18662	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Executives said they hoped to report narrower full-year losses and a 2009 return to profit -- which would be Elan's first since the company nearly went bankrupt amid an accounting scandal in 2002.
14089	18664	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
14090	18666	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	It's a strong turnaround from 2005, when Elan faced potential financial ruin over the surprise withdrawal of Tysabri.
14091	18667	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Three clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called PML, and two died.
14092	18668	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
14093	18669	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.
14094	18670	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The three PML victims were simultaneously taking another MS-fighting drug
14095	18671	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.
14096	18672	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The further we go (without any new PML cases), the more comfortable that people become and the more that patients demand to be put on Tysabri," Cooke said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
14097	18673	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
14098	18674	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He said close to 7 percent were already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20 percent would be.
14099	18675	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
14100	18677	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the drug today.
14101	18678	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan's spending on research and development increased 36 percent to US$81.2 million (euro51.8 million), chiefly reflecting efforts to produce treatments and a potential cure for the brain- destroying Alzheimer's disease.
14102	18679	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan and its research partner, Wyeth, plan to present second- phase results for one potential Alzheimer's treatment, bapineuzumab, at a Chicago conference for neurologists Tuesday.
14103	18680	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical trials.
14104	18682	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The Alzheimer's need is, unfortunately, immense," Martin said.
14105	18683	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"It is probably the largest single market that's as yet untapped by the biopharmaceutical industry."
14106	18685	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan shares suffered their biggest drop in seven months Thursday, closing down 8.8 percent at euro20.12 (US$31.49).

14112	18695	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	"If Ismael Khan's current efforts fail, Kabul will be plunged into a new and bitter round of fighting," warned his aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
14113	18696	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	The Herat governor was to meet Hekmatyar at his headquarters in the eastern district of Charasiab.
14114	18697	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	A close associate of Rabbani, Ismael Khan will impress upon Hekmatyar that his mission offered a last opportunity to end the fighting, the aide said.
14115	18698	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Ismael Khan has refused to talk with journalists but his aides said he planned to hold a press conference after completing his series of talks with feuding leaders.
14116	18699	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	He is also likely to meet Ali Mazari of the pro-Iranian Hezb-i-Wahdat, a group of Shiite Moslems who are indirectly siding with Hekmatyar.
14117	18700	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Sources in Ismael Khan's delegation, comprising officials from several western provinces, said the peace mission had taken on special importance following the recent apparent rejection of special UN envoy Mehmoud Mestiri's peace proposals.
14118	18704	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"SARS has already taught us the lesson that local officials who neglected their duties, gave false reports... were punished," it said in a report on the Anhui problems.
14119	18706	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	By Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency said the death toll had risen to 20 with another 1,520 children infected.
14120	18707	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All those infected were reportedly below the age of six, with the majority of them just two years old.
14121	18708	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All kindergartens in the city were closed on Tuesday, Xinhua said, as authorities scrambled to contain the virus nearly two months after the first signs of potential major problems.
14122	18709	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Hospitals in Fuyang city in Anhui started to admit children in early March with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers or rashes on their hands and feet, all symptoms of the virus, Xinhua said.
14123	18710	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	EV71, which causes hand, foot and mouth disease, is very contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or faeces of an infected person.
14124	18711	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Young children are most susceptible because of lower immune systems.
14125	18712	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	However Xinhua quoted an infectious disease specialist as saying that there was no need for panic with the latest outbreak, and that most of the children would recover.
14126	18713	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"An overwhelming majority of the patients are curable," said Li Xingwang, who is in charge of the expert panel for prevention and treatment of the virus.
14127	18714	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"Most of the children could recover after a week's treatment."
14128	18715	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	In its article, the China Youth Daily said that far scarier than the actual epidemic was the local government's initial denial of rumours about the disease.
14129	18716	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"When the terrifying virus had already infected more than 10 unrelated children, the local government denied the rumour," it said.
14130	18717	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	A local official denied there was any cover-up at his level, saying the incident had been reported to higher authorities.

14171	18780	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Hoyer told NBC television on Sunday.
14172	18782	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	Some legislators who are now prominent war critics, including Senators Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, expressed misgivings but still voted for the authorization.
14173	18783	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The non-binding House measure says in less than 100 words that "Congress disapproves" of Bush's so-called troop surge, and expresses continued support for the military -- an apparent attempt to avoid appearing unpatriotic and lure undecided Republicans.
14174	18786	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The breakdown in the narrowly-divided Senate is 51 Democrats to 49 Republicans, meaning bills require a greater degree of bipartisan support to pass.

14178	18790	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	House leaders have allowed each member five minutes to comment on the measure.
14179	18791	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	A vote is expected by Friday.
14180	18792	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	"We don't believe that that policy will work," Hoyer said in his NBC interview.

14804	19444	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	I may remind you, September the 11th, the reaction was similar.

14806	19448	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"In a way," he said, "Russians are fighting a proxy war with the West through us."
14807	19450	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	When Georgia cracked down on South Ossetia on Aug. 7, Russia sent its tanks and troops into the two regions and deeper into Georgia proper.
14808	19451	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgia, bordering the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia, was ruled by Moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.

14810	19454	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russia has distributed passports to most people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and stationed peacekeepers there since the early 1990s.
14811	19462	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The convoy was mainly support vehicles, including ambulances, although there were a few heavy cannons.
14812	19463	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	There were about 100 combat troops and another 100 medics, drivers and other support personnel.

14826	19488	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	With strong safety Jermaine Phillips out with a broken arm, Sabby Piscitelli has been under increased scrutiny lately.
14827	19489	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And the second-year player from Oregon State responded Sunday with a memorable interception.
14828	19490	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The Bucs led 17-14 early in the fourth, but the Raiders had it first and 10 at the Bucs 26.
14829	19491	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Moments earlier, a face mask against Gaines Adams wiped out Phillip Buchanon's interception.
14830	19492	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right toward tight end Zach Miller.
14831	19493	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The ball was off the mark and Piscitelli was off to the races.
14832	19494	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field, shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11 for an 84-yard return.
14833	19495	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.
14834	19496	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Piscitelli, 25, talked about the return and the disappointment of the season-ending 31-24 defeat.
14835	19497	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Describe the play.
14836	19498	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	JaMarcus tried to look me off, and I just got a good break on it.
14837	19499	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was a good rush and made him (overthrow it).
14838	19500	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I tried to play the ball and do what I could with it.
14839	19501	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm kind of disappointed I didn't score, but that's a long run.
14840	19502	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What was going through your head as you were nearing the end zone?
14841	19503	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I was trying to score.
14842	19504	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I cut back and broke a tackle or two, but your body almost shuts off at that point.
14843	19505	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I even tried to stop and let JaMarcus run by me.
14844	19506	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But my legs were just (shot).
14845	19507	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I just wanted to get all the yards I could at that second.
14846	19508	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Did you see the block that Jackson threw for you?
14847	19509	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Actually, when I cut off that (block), that's when my body starting shutting down.
14848	19510	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm just glad the offense scored, and it kind of bailed us out of that situation.
14849	19511	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What has happened to this team in the fourth quarter?
14850	19512	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	No excuses.
14851	19513	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	You go to the film, and the most important thing is you have to finish.
14852	19514	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think we did play well on defense.
14853	19515	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But we have to go to the film and see what our mistakes were.
14854	19516	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It's a four-quarter game, and I'm disappointed I couldn't help the team more.
14855	19517	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How disappointing is it to have the season end this way?
14856	19518	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It's rough.
14857	19519	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I know it's something that I take personally.
14858	19520	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen next year and improve my game to make sure I don't contribute to any losses we have.
14859	19521	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How important was it to you to make a statement personally?
14860	19522	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's what safeties and corners are there for to make those big plays and try to turn games around.
14861	19523	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think the Bucs had that in mind when they drafted me.
14862	19524	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's something I have to work on.
14863	19525	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was good to help make a big play and to help us try to win this game.
14864	19526	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The defensive line did a great job on that, so they get most of the credit.

14873	19535	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Rospars Keffer, 37, her husband, Michael Keffer, 44, and their children -- Megan, 9

14875	19537	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	and Riley, 4 -- returned to their Long Island home Tuesday from a five-day, four-night trip, courtesy of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
14876	19538	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The vacation was the family's first.
14877	19539	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	They hadn't been able to afford to take along teachers who would help with the kids.
14878	19540	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"You have to even the numbers.
14879	19541	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	It has to be one on one," Rospars Keffer said.
14880	19542	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	About a year ago, Michael Keffer's sister, Wendy Heaton, sent an e-mail asking DeGeneres to consider the Keffer family if she were to dedicate a show to a deserving family.
14881	19544	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	In January, the comedienne surprised Heaton and Rospars Keffer with a phone call during a taping of the show, telling them she would provide a trip for both families.
14882	19545	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It's amazing what you're doing, and Julie, it's wonderful that you stay so positive," DeGeneres said.
14883	19547	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Meals were paid for by Disney, which also let the Keffer family spend one night at the Cinderella Castle Suite, replete with a butler.
14884	19548	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"You couldn't buy this trip even if you wanted to," DeGeneres said.
14885	19549	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It really was incredible," Rospars Keffer said.
14886	19550	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	During the trip, the family went on rides, interacted with characters at meals, lounged at the hotel pool and spent time with the Heaton family and other relatives who also went along.
14887	19551	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Megan, who can answer questions when she can choose among answers, said she liked Magic Kingdom more than EPCOT and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad more than Space Mountain.
14888	19552	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	For Riley, who is conversational, the monorail was the best part of the trip.
14889	19553	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Although Abbie, who does not have functional language skills, had difficulty getting through the dark and confined waiting line areas, Rospars Keffer said she loved the roller coasters.
14890	19554	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"The faster and the scarier it was," she said, "Abbie liked it more."

14893	19557	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	His wife agreed, saying "We said it will be hard to go back after this."

14911	19583	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	Nelson Chamisa said "close to 200" MDC supporters had been seized in the raid on the party's headquarters in central Harare.
14912	19584	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	He said in a telephone interview that three truckloads of riot police arrived at the headquarters around midday.
14913	19585	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	The police broke up a "routine meeting" called by the MDC to discuss party issues ahead of next year's crucial presidential and parliamentary polls, Chamisa added.
14914	19586	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate word from the government.
14915	19589	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	Most recently, police arrested and assaulted defense lawyers acting on behalf of opposition members.
14916	19591	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	Chamisa said many of those arrested in Saturday's raid were members of the youth wing.
14917	19592	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	"This is hypocrisy by this regime," he said.
14918	19593	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	"This is a selective application of what they call the law."
14919	19594	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week police in Harare extended a controversial ban on demonstrations and rallies for one month, citing fears of political violence.
14920	19595	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	But Saturday's meeting "was neither a demonstration nor a rally," Chamisa said.
14921	19596	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	"We are worried for the safety" of those arrested, he said.
14922	19597	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	At least 12 opposition supporters arrested in a similar raid on the party's headquarters in March are still in custody, accused of planning acts of terrorism.

14930	19613	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	`Religious Enlightenment' Part of Detainee Reeducation Effort
14931	19615	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said such efforts, aimed mainly at Iraqis who have been held for more than a year, are intended to "bend them back to our will" and are part of waging war in what he called "the battlefield of the mind."
14932	19616	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Most of the younger detainees are held in a facility that the military calls the "House of Wisdom."
14933	19617	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense bloggers.
14934	19618	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Such schooling "tears apart" the arguments of al-Qaida, such as "Let's kill innocents" and helps to "bring some of the edge off" the detainees, he said.
14935	19619	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	As a result of the increased U.S. troop presence in Iraq this year, the number of Iraqis in U.S. detention has swelled from about 10,000 last year to more than 25,000.
14936	19620	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The effort to reshape attitudes among the growing detainee population is aimed at addressing a problem that has vexed U.S. troops in Iraq for the past four years: Military detention facilities have served as breeding grounds for extremist views, transforming some prisoners into hard-core insurgents, according to military analysts.
14937	19621	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
14938	19622	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and interrogators help distinguish the extremists from others, he said.
14939	19623	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some detainees are recommended for release.
14940	19624	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If a detainee is an imperative security risk ... then I'm going to reduce that risk and I'm going to replace that destructive ideology," he said.
14941	19625	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"And then when he's assessed to no longer be a threat, I'm going to release the detainee being less likely to be a recidivist."
14942	19626	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Since May, Stone said, he has released about 2,000 detainees "and we've not had any coming back."
14943	19627	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his goal is to keep those who are released from harming U.S. troops or anyone else.
14944	19628	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"They're not going out of here unless I can feel comfortable about that," Stone added.
14945	19629	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not doing mass releases."
14946	19630	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other initiatives at the facilities include vocational training and basic education programs for about 7,000 detainees.
14947	19631	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he believes his approach is "compelling because it's how you win this war, not only the one in Iraq, but the one on a greater basis."
14948	19633	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The 25,000 detainees now being held in U.S. facilities in Iraq include more than 820 juveniles, Stone said, most of whom are held in the House of Wisdom, which opened last month and is located at the Camp Victory military base near Baghdad's airport.
14949	19634	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said that six additional young people had been sent to him just Tuesday, and that "the trend is towards the youth," including 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds.
14950	19636	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said that youths grow up to become insurgents by starting out as messengers, guards and even planters of makeshift bombs.
14951	19637	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his staff members include a specialist in Islamic youth programs and he has also put together "a positive program that has been proven in Islam to actually turn the kids around to sort of reject some of these other things."
14952	19638	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone, who speaks Arabic and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have 30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors.
14953	19639	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also started "four very large soccer programs" aimed at young detainees.
14954	19640	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The new religious training, Stone said, helps U.S. forces pinpoint the hard-core extremists.
14955	19641	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I want to know who they are," he said.

15111	19843	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	To remind motorists that they must stop whenever someone steps off the curb into a crosswalk.
15112	19844	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In an unusual undercover operation, Delgado posed as a pedestrian on a busy street while fellow officers waited for drivers to barrel past her in violation of a law that requires them yield at crosswalks, even if there is no stop sign.
15113	19845	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Chicago this year joined a growing number of big cities and small towns that are sending officers into traffic to make motorists pay more attention to pedestrians.
15114	19846	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"People, they don't care," said Delgado, whose bright pink baseball hat and orange blouse made her especially tough to miss.
15115	19847	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It's 'Get out of my way.'
15116	19848	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The whole mentality is 'Get out of my way.'"
15117	19849	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	With Delgado's help, police stopped 78 vehicles in just two hours and told them they'd violated a law that's been on the books for years.
15118	19850	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	That number easily could have been doubled, but officers stopped only drivers who kept moving after Delgado had walked four or five feet into the road.
15119	19851	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	When they were pulled over, motorists offered all kinds of explanations: One saw the pedestrian in the crosswalk but hadn't heard about the law requiring him to stop.
15120	19852	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Another knew about the law but didn't see the pedestrian.
15121	19853	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,800 pedestrians were killed and 61,000 injured in 2006, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
15122	19854	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago alone, 65 pedestrians have died annually in recent years.
15123	19855	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The number of deaths has dropped, but there is concern those numbers could climb again as more vehicles hit the road, and the elderly population skyrockets.
15124	19857	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"That, along with more cars ... is a recipe for danger."
15125	19858	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Some communities already are seeing more walkers because of the slow economy.
15126	19859	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"The way gas prices are, people are rediscovering their feet," said Pam Fischer, highway traffic safety director in New Jersey, which recently launched a "Cops in the Crosswalks" program.
15127	19860	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the law, then sent relieved drivers on their way.
15128	19861	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	But police understand that the only thing more effective than a lecture from a police officer is a lecture and a ticket.
15129	19862	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"If there's really no threat of getting a ticket for it, you're not going to really pay attention," said officer Chuck Trendle, who was working with Delgado.
15130	19864	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"But until you hit somebody in the wallet, it doesn't stick."
15131	19865	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The threat of a ticket seemed to work in Bellingham, Washington.
15132	19866	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	After the city started a police-decoy program in 2002, the percentage of drivers who yielded to pedestrians rose at least 25 percent -- even at corners where tickets were not being issued.
15133	19867	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In St. Petersburg, Florida, the results were even more impressive.
15134	19868	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The percentage of motorists who yielded to pedestrians jumped from 2 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2007, after police began writing tickets, educating the public and installing flashing beacons.
15135	19869	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Pedestrian crashes dropped 17 percent between 2005 and 2006.
15136	19871	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Police say undercover pedestrians will focus attention on crosswalk safety the same way that giving tickets for seat belt violations convinced more people to buckle up in the 1980s.
15137	19872	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"Eventually, people get it," Trendle said.
15138	19873	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	O.T. ISN ' T AS SIMPLE AS TELLING TIME
15139	19874	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A woman in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when she submitted her time sheet.
15140	19875	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	She had worked 800 hours of overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or 13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
15141	19876	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living.
15142	19877	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Bird had logged so many hours.
15143	19878	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And the labor lawyers?
15144	19879	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her overtime pay.
15145	19880	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about it anymore.
15146	19881	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
15147	19882	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says that unless you are an "exempt worker" you must be paid time and a half after a 40-hour workweek.
15148	19883	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
15149	19884	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Usually "exempt" is a relief, as in "exempt" from jury duty.
15150	19885	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law.
15151	19886	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets paid.
15152	19887	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
15153	19888	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services, professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low- level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.
15154	19889	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In 2003, the Bush administration set out to "clarify" the law, revising income-level tests in various job categories (above them, you are a salaried manager and don't get overtime
15155	19890	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	below them, you are not a manager and you do) and specifying that more than half a manager's time actually has to be spent managing.
15156	19891	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
15157	19894	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Who's exempt?
15158	19895	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
15159	19896	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Let's take those one at a time.
15160	19897	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The "who's eligible, who's exempt?"
15161	19898	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
15162	19899	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
15163	19900	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
15164	19901	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at lunch.
15165	19902	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk.
15166	19903	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
15167	19904	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
15168	19905	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Or an e-mail message from a client?
15169	19906	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And you respond?
15170	19907	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Are you working again?
15171	19909	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
15172	19910	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone when you are technically off the clock?
15173	19911	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"BlackBerry time is work time," said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices group of Fenwick &amp
15174	19912	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
15175	19913	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	West, a law firm.
15176	19914	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It absolutely counts."
15177	19915	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
15178	19916	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule.
15179	19917	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And while the people most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too.
15180	19918	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time."
15181	19919	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if so many of us qualify for overtime, and there are so many opportunities for overtime, why aren't more of us getting more extra pay?
15182	19920	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
15183	19921	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
15184	19922	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Of course, there are electronic records of work calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.
15185	19923	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It is daunting to keep an accurate record," said John Thompson, a partner in the Atlanta office of Fisher &amp
15186	19924	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
15187	19925	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Phillips, a labor and employment firm.
15188	19926	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"In a wireless world, nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
15189	19927	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Put another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when they are working from when they are not.
15190	19928	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
15191	19929	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens.
15192	19930	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
15193	19931	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
15194	19932	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Plaintiffs' lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that workers wrongly classified as "exempt" are reluctant to change their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.
15195	19934	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The company paid a substantial settlement, "then went back to doing things the old way," he said.
15196	19935	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?"'
15197	19936	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Thierman recalled.

15199	19939	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	BEIJING 2007-11-28 13:41:50 UTC
15200	19940	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	China's rise as a global trading power obligates it to drop barriers preventing foreign competition in its domestic market and contributing to its ballooning trade surplus, the European Union's top trade official said Wednesday.
15201	19941	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in Beijing.
15202	19942	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year.

15204	19944	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This is not because of any lack of competitiveness by Europe," Mandelson said.
15205	19945	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"The EU has a surplus with the rest of the world where we are allowed to compete freely."
15206	19946	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The commissioner's remarks, while pointed and critical, did not contain any new proposals or mention any possible EU sanctions.
15207	19947	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes it is necessary to deliver difficult messages on trade ... but they are always constructive," he said.
15208	19948	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright piracy.
15209	19950	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	He also said China was "sincere and ambitious" in its efforts in protecting intellectual property rights and was giving market forces more determination over the value of the yuan.
15210	19951	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"In China's open market, every trading partner is treated equally," he said, adding that Beijing doesn't seek to have a trade surplus with its partners.
15211	19952	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue in March, officials said.
15212	19956	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Discussions covered currency markets and other economic issues, although neither side indicated any breakthroughs.
15213	19958	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the euro," Juncker told reporters.
15214	19959	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"We do think we have to correct this obvious imbalance," Juncker said.
15215	19963	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"China's relations with the EU date back to the early days of the European Community," Li said.
15216	19964	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This relationship has a history of decades, and since 1975, this relationship has come a long way."
15217	19966	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Long-shot Huckabee determined to fight to the end
15218	19967	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Mike Huckabee may still be a long shot in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, but his weekend victories in Kansas and Louisiana proved he is likely to be a thorn in the side of frontrunner John McCain for some time to come.
15219	19968	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Despite McCain's solid lead in the battle for delegates to the Republican nominating convention, which analysts call nearly impossible to overcome, Huckabee insisted Sunday he was going to fight all the way to the wire.
15220	19969	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it needs unity against the powerful Democrats.
15221	19971	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"This country was built on the impossible.
15222	19972	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And it's impossible that I'm still in the race.
15223	19973	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That's what most people would have said a few months ago."
15224	19975	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	In Louisiana, Huckabee squeaked out a narrow win, 43 percent to 42 percent.
15225	19976	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he narrowly lost the Washington state caucus, which voted 26 percent for McCain, 24 percent for Huckabee.
15226	19977	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He said Sunday however that he would launch a challenge to the Washington State caucus results, complaining that far too few of votes were counted when the election was called in McCain's favor.
15227	19978	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he rejected calls for to pull out of the race.
15228	19979	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"The fact they're blowing against me hardly motivates me to quit," he told reporters in Washington.
15229	19980	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"It motivates me to play harder.
15230	19981	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	If they think they're getting a chorus of voices that will make me say okay, it's time to leave, they don't know me very well."
15231	19983	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But he refused to concede any inevitability Sunday.
15232	19984	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm prepared to stay in until somebody has 1,191 delegates because that's the magic number at which a person is the nominee of the party," Huckabee insisted on CBS.
15233	19986	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"So are we to tell them, 'Forget your vote
15234	19987	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	we don't even care what you think?"
15235	19988	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee's success has come on the back of the party's conservatives, who have made well-known their disgust with McCain, branding him a "closet liberal."
15236	19991	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	McCain's views on immigration "were way out of the mainstream and quite unorthodox.
15237	19992	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He has been often the voice in the wilderness," he added.
15238	19994	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I've actually run a government," he told CBS.
15239	19995	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think senators have the luxury of taking several issues, maybe two or three, and they can specialize in them."
15240	19997	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Huckabee's refusal to pull out of the race -- as did Mitt Romney on Thursday -- could deepen the party division between conservatives and Republicans ready to back McCain because he stands the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in November.
15241	19998	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But the conservatives are also said to hope their resistance to McCain could push him to adopt more of their positions, like an absolute opposition to abortion and a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
15242	19999	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	One widely-reported scenario has Huckabee accepting to be McCain's vice presidential running mate in the election.
15243	20002	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	I'm not sure I would select him," he said.
15244	20003	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"There are no discussions for such a thing because, at this point, I'm still running for president.
15245	20004	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	There's no other reason for me to think otherwise."

15248	20007	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
15249	20008	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
15250	20011	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
15251	20012	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"I do feel vindicated," he added.
15252	20013	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"It restored my faith in the legal system.
15253	20014	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The jury paid close attention."
15254	20015	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the big guy.
15255	20016	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	It's one of these things where the system works for a change."
15256	20017	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing.
15257	20018	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
15258	20019	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
15259	20020	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit, Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay for $1.3 million.
15260	20021	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
15261	20022	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000 for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
15262	20023	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights to them.
15263	20024	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
15264	20025	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
15265	20026	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann and Shugart couldn't account for the fact that the total value of the jury award equaled the amount Shugart had planned to seek for the images on eBay.
15266	20027	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence or not, I don't know," Mann said.
15267	20028	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case, "so far as we know," is the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Mann said.
15268	20029	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
15269	20030	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
15270	20031	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image, but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered.
15271	20032	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
15272	20033	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"The axiom that the copyright is created when the image is created means nothing."

15278	20042	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	China's government employees should be banned from offering or receiving cigarettes on social occasions as a first step towards the country's goal to minimize the harm of tobacco on people's health.

15280	20044	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Yan said government employees should not be allowed to accept cigarettes for free or at discounted prices from tobacco companies.

15283	20047	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Film producers and cinemas should play anti-smoking adverts during intervals, and all TVs should air these adverts for free at prime time," she said.
15284	20048	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Beijing banned smoking in taxis last October, a latest move toward a smoking- free Olympic Games in August.

15361	20141	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Lawyers for the defendant, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, had been expected to call a fellow infantryman, who testified last week against Wuterich, back to the stand.
15362	20143	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	After a three-hour delay, however, the defense dropped its plan to cross-examine Dela Cruz and the hearing ended.
15363	20144	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Dela Cruz, who received immunity in April after prosecutors dropped murder charges against him in exchange for his testimony, had testified that Wuterich fired his M-16 rifle at the five men as they stood near the car, some with their hands raised in surrender.
15364	20145	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	The defense had been expected to challenge that view.
15365	20146	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich has admitted to shooting the men but said they began running away, defying orders to halt.
15366	20147	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	His lawyers argued that running away in the moments after the bomb detonated could be construed as a hostile act under the Marine Corps rules of engagement in Iraq, where such attacks have posed the most frequent and deadliest threat to U.S. troops.
15367	20148	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	But Wuterich's lawyers have not been able to prove that the men were running away
15368	20149	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	on the contrary, testimony from a government forensic expert said the men's wounds suggested that they were not moving away when they were shot.
15369	20151	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Kallop was also granted immunity in return for his testimony.
15370	20152	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's hearing is the last involving the four men initially charged with murder after the attack.
15371	20153	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Murder charges against one of two enlisted men were dismissed in July.
15372	20154	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Last month, Lt. Col. Paul J. Ware, who has presided over the hearings for all three enlisted men in the Haditha case, recommended dismissing all charges against the other enlisted man, but no decision has been made.
15373	20155	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Those two men -- Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum -- were charged with killing nine people.

15375	20158	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	In the statement, Wuterich took responsibility for his decisions in the heat of battle to kill people in the two houses who he said were suspected of being armed insurgents, and for the order he gave to his men to "shoot first, ask questions later."
15376	20159	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	"I wanted them to understand," he said, repeating a central argument of his defense, "that hesitation to shoot would only result in the four of us being killed."

15380	20163	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
15381	20164	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Allstate Texas Lloyds is raising home insurance rates 5.9 percent statewide, the company said Monday.
15382	20165	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Coastal residents in counties once and twice removed from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Harris and Montgomery counties, will also see an additional average 2 percent rate hike.
15383	20166	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	That's to help cover the cost of reinsurance, or insurance the company buys for itself to help pay for claims in the event of a catastrophe, the company said.
15384	20167	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Residents of Galveston County and a sliver of Harris County will not be hit with the average 2 percent increase because the company dropped windstorm coverage in counties that touch coastal waters last year.
15385	20168	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The rates will change on policies as they come up for renewal, Allstate said.
15386	20169	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rising construction costs also contributed to the rate hike, the company said.
15387	20170	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	About 700,000 of Allstate's 917,000 Texas policyholders are insured by Allstate Texas Lloyds.
15388	20171	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Allstate withdrew a proposed 6.9 percent statewide increase in homeowners rates after the Texas Department of Insurance signaled that it wouldn't approve rates.
15389	20173	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The range of rates coastal residents will pay was not available, he said.
15390	20174	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies in Texas are allowed to implement their rate increases upon filing them with regulators without prior approval.
15391	20175	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	However, regulators can disapprove the rates after they've been implemented and order refunds.
15392	20176	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rod Bordelon, of the Texas Office of Public Insurance Counsel that represents consumers, said he anticipates the office will oppose the rates.
15393	20177	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"I see no basis for any such increase," said Bordelon, the public counsel.
15394	20178	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"We're still looking at it."
15395	20180	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	He said that if Bordelon opposes the increase "that opinion has a great deal of weight to it."
15396	20182	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Farmers which also withdrew proposed rate increases last month in anticipation of opposition from the state has yet to file a new proposal, a spokeswoman said.
15397	20186	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Everyone was asked to rise.
15398	20187	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen stepped forward, followed by an entourage of city department heads.
15399	20188	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His smile looked more pained than happy, and he waved stiffly at board members and the handful of people who sat in the audience.
15400	20189	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.
15401	20190	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once heralded as a brilliant state legislator and a can-do mayor loved by the wealthy and well-connected in his hometown, Cohen, 60, is expected to make an announcement today about his election plans for 2009.
15402	20191	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Many of his allies expect him to call it quits.
15403	20192	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The fall from grace followed missteps richly woven into a city that prides itself on good schools, parks, and expensive real estate.
15404	20193	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The new $197 million high school Cohen has staked his reputation on has become the most expensive school construction in state history and a symbol of suburban excess.
15405	20194	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The local weekly twice called for him to leave office at the end of his term.
15406	20196	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	And in the midst of these battles, Cohen this week proposed increasing his salary of $97,876 by 28 percent, quickly withdrawing the idea after it was greeted with derision.
15407	20198	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has become a kind of lightning rod on the ((override)) issue.
15408	20199	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	People have said to me that they would otherwise vote yes, but are uncomfortable doing so with him in office beyond this term."
15409	20201	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There have been some concerns that the programming is extravagant, that the building" is extravagant, Cohen said, growing angry with a reporter's questions.

15413	20205	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He noted repeatedly that the project is "exactly the same" as it was when it was conceived, approved, and voted on by aldermen and taxpayers several years ago.
15414	20206	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing secretive about it," he said before cutting the interview short.
15415	20207	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"They ((critics)) say there's not enough money and there's too much money.
15416	20208	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	I've planned for contingencies."
15417	20210	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Newton may be a small city of 80,000, but politicians frequently talk about residents' "expectation of excellence," especially when it comes to schools.
15418	20211	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's plans for the new Newton North High were clearly designed to meet that standard.
15419	20212	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	In 2002, he announced plans to renovate Newton North High School, but the $40 million renovation ballooned into a $109 million project to build a new "state of the art" high school after parents learned that students would need to be relocated during construction.
15420	20213	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Aldermen and state officials urged Cohen to scale back the new plan, but he did not.
15421	20214	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Instead, with the support of a majority of the aldermen, the city hired architect Graham Gund to design the building.
15422	20215	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Since then, costs continued to soar.
15423	20218	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I don't think it's fair to jump to a conclusion that he had someone do his dirty work," Solomon said about Cohen, in reference to the incident.
15424	20219	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has faced the Board of Aldermen on many, many occasions and not only to present good news."
15425	20220	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Solomon said last night that he could not remember the circumstances of why the mayor may have left City Hall that day.
15426	20221	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's coalition of support had already begun to crumble, undermined by the cost of the building, an unrelated fight with the city firefighters union, and increasingly feisty aldermen.
15427	20223	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She said it was a big change from her early days in office when Cohen invited board members to meetings in his office, and she thought they shared many similar views on education (she supported the new school) and the environment.
15428	20224	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She has since broken with Cohen.
15429	20225	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He was elected to set the policy and vision of the city.

15431	20227	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Sangiolo said.
15432	20229	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's refusal to acknowledge critics' concerns has baffled even supporters.

15434	20231	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He can be "awkward socially" but funny, she said.

15436	20233	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Some say the writing is on the wall.
15437	20234	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen did not hold his annual fund-raiser this year, and gave his campaign manager permission to get rid of his lawn signs.

15439	20236	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen surely hopes his legacy will be Newton North High School.

15448	20249	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	To make sure women like Sasao get the message, Nissan Motor Co. launched a merchandise line for Pino, including pink bear-shaped cushions, seat covers with hearts, a CD case that looks like fat red lips, and a colorful cover for a tissue box.
15449	20251	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	It's made by Suzuki Motor Inc.
15450	20252	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But under a manufacturing agreement, Nissan packages Suzuki's Alto model differently, with fancier seat fabric, a distinct front design and a hubcap inspired by a snowflake so the wheels appear to sparkle on the road -- all touches to give the car that cute look.
15451	20253	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan had 5,500 orders for the Pino in the first month since it went on sale in January, more than double the company target of 2,500 a month.
15452	20254	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Sasao knew the Alto looked a lot like her Pino and was quite a bit cheaper.
15453	20255	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The Pino starts at about 1 million yen (US$8,600
15454	20256	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro6,500), while the Alto starts at 650,000 yen (US$5,600
15455	20257	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro4,200).
15456	20258	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But she still was willing to spend more -- and take out a six-year auto loan -- for the Pino because she thought it was so much cuter.
15457	20259	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	While models such as sportscars or family minivans target segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they usually don't sell in numbers.
15458	20260	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Toyota Motor Corp. officials often say they don't believe in overly specific marketing tactics, which are apt to backfire for an automaker known for best-sellers like the Camry and Corolla.
15459	20261	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	And in most countries, experts tend to advise against making autos pink or adding other "cute" features to appeal to female drivers partly because that may smack of sexism and turn off women -- except in Japan.
15460	20262	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Here, young women are extremely powerful in setting trends, and the culture of cute is so prevalent grown men aren't embarrassed about dangling little mascots from cell phones.
15461	20266	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Even the advertising for Pino is tailored to women who are about 20 years old.
15462	20268	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The TV ads also tell a similar story.
15463	20269	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan marketing manager Miwa Ishii says one goal for Pino is to court young drivers to the Nissan brand with hopes they'll move on to buy more expensive models in the future.
15464	20270	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities -- exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.
15465	20271	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"Rather than talk about the features of a minicar, we thought it's better to talk about how cute it is," she said.
15466	20272	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model.
15467	20273	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	We're starting from zero to build public awareness about it."

15474	20286	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-06-08 16:13:46 UTC
15475	20287	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered that Paris Hilton be brought to court Friday for a hearing on her early release from jail rather than listen to the proceeding by telephone.
15476	20288	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer was the latest in a flurry of developments surrounding Hilton's early release from prison.
15477	20289	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That move sparked protests by many -- including local and state authorities and civil rights leaders -- who argued it could interpreted as affording the socialite favors not available to other, less famous, inmates.
15478	20291	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Judge Sauer has instructed the Sheriff's Department to go to Ms. Hilton's residence, pick her up and bring her here.
15479	20292	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That is happening now," Parachini told reporters outside the courthouse.
15480	20293	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton on Thursday was originally ordered to report to court at 9 a.m. (1600 GMT) and the judge signed an order for deputies to bring her in a sheriff's vehicle from her home, said Allan Parachini.
15481	20294	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	But early Friday, Parachini had announced that she would be allowed to take part in the hearing by telephone.
15482	20295	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
15483	20296	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk at news cameras.
15484	20297	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	One of them was Moses Baltazar who was attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket.
15485	20298	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he was no fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from her.
15486	20299	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.
15487	20300	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Driving like that, you have to behave.
15488	20301	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	If you're rich, you have money, you have to respect yourself," he said, adding he thinks she should be returned to jail.
15489	20302	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence.
15490	20303	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She had spent three days, and was credited for five.
15491	20304	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton was fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and was expected to finish the sentence for a reckless driving probation violation at her four-bedroom, three-bath home.
15492	20305	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
15493	20306	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention.
15494	20307	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Late Thursday, Sauer issued the order for Hilton to return to court after the city attorney filed a petition demanding that Hilton be returned to jail and to show cause why Baca should not be held in contempt of court.
15495	20308	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca does not have to be in court, and it was unclear who would represent the Sheriff's Department.
15496	20310	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"What transpired here is outrageous," county Supervisor Don Knabe told The Associated Press, adding he received more than 400 angry e-mails and hundreds more phone calls from around the country.
15497	20311	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's return home "gives the impression of ... celebrity justice being handed out," he said.
15498	20312	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca dismissed the criticism, saying the decision was made based on medical advice.
15499	20314	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca said.
15500	20315	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	California Attorney General Jerry Brown criticized the Sheriff's Department for letting Hilton out of jail, saying he believed she should serve out her sentence.
15501	20316	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It does hold up the system to ridicule when the powerful and the famous get special treatment," Brown told The Associated Press in an interview before testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.
15502	20317	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure there's a lot of people who've seen their family members go to jail and have various ailments, physical and psychological, that didn't get them released," he said.
15503	20318	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'd say it's time for a course correction."
15504	20320	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip.
15505	20321	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	As word spread that the 26-year-old poster child for bad celebrity behavior was back home, radio helicopter pilots who normally report on traffic conditions were dispatched to hover over her house and describe it to morning commuters.
15506	20322	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Paparazzi photographers on the ground quickly assembled outside its gates.
15507	20323	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her attorney.
15508	20325	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I am going to serve the remaining 40 days of my sentence.
15509	20326	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	I have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes."
15510	20327	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's path to jail began Sept. 7, when she failed a sobriety test after police saw her weaving down a street in her Mercedes- Benz on what she said was a late-night run to a hamburger stand.
15511	20328	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 (euro1,124) in fines.
15512	20329	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the months that followed she was stopped twice by officers who discovered her driving on a suspended license.
15513	20330	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The second stop landed her in Sauer's courtroom, where he sentenced her to jail.

15523	20343	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from running for re-election.
15524	20344	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
15525	20345	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In his appearance on Thursday, Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm, will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- and its potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady hand and business experience.
15526	20346	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
15527	20347	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
15528	20348	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the council.
15529	20349	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	His staff is drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two.
15530	20350	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But the measure would require voter approval for the change to become permanent, these people said.
15531	20351	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk.
15532	20352	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
15533	20353	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996.
15534	20354	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
15535	20355	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"Democracy," he added, "is bigger than any one person."
15536	20356	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
15537	20357	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes.
15538	20358	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call for abolishing term limits.
15539	20359	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The New York Post and the New York Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
15540	20360	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
15541	20361	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
15542	20363	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
15543	20364	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor," said the person who has advised the mayor in the past.
15544	20365	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"It's not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it."
15545	20366	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
15546	20367	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
15547	20368	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty, that they may not remain for a full third term.
15548	20369	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
15549	20370	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
15550	20371	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
15551	20373	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
15552	20375	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This is a good time for him to do this.
15553	20376	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People are scared."
15554	20377	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
15555	20378	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
15556	20379	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Now, he added, "I could support the idea of a third term."
15557	20380	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in the New York Post.
15558	20382	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term- limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two- thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- a third term.
15559	20383	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
15560	20384	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.
15561	20385	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's change of heart is certain to cause chaos in the city's political class.

15625	20463	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack in the book market raised questions about the effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in the capital but not the number of car bombings.
15626	20464	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep black smoke billowing above the city.

15634	20486	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of Congress heard wrenching testimony on Monday from wounded soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and contrite promises from top Army officials to correct the conditions there.
15635	20488	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said they were working to address the problems at Walter Reed and were examining the situation at other medical centers.
15636	20489	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We have let some soldiers down," said Pete Geren, the undersecretary of the Army, addressing the panel before the hearing began.
15637	20490	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were to testify.
15638	20491	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop for the hearing, the first of several that congressional committees intend to hold.
15639	20492	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The subcommittee members heard first on Monday from two soldiers badly hurt in the war in Iraq, and from the spouse of another soldier injured in Iraq, about their experiences at Walter Reed.
15640	20493	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Together, the trio's stories set the emotional tenor for the testimony from military officials that followed.
15641	20494	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi, causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
15642	20495	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient treatment, he recounted.
15643	20496	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Despite being extremely disoriented, he said, he was given a map and told to find his own way to his new residence on the hospital's sprawling grounds.
15644	20497	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He wandered into a building and received directions.
15645	20498	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
15646	20499	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He told of languishing in the hospital's bureaucratic system that evaluates soldiers for continuing in active duty or becoming medically retired, and what benefits they should receive.
15647	20500	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start over several times.
15648	20501	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Spc. Jeremy Duncan, one ear shredded by a makeshift bomb, told of the moldy living conditions in Building 18.
15649	20502	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't fit for anybody to live in a room like that," Duncan said.

15651	20505	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was "extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The Washington Post.
15652	20507	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said extensive repairs were being made to deal with the deplorable conditions at one of the facilities on the hospital campus, Building 18, in which soldiers getting outpatient treatment at the hospital were found to be living in crumbling rooms soiled by mice, cockroaches and mold.
15653	20508	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Most of the soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.

15660	20517	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Last week, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey was ousted over his handling of the revelations at Walter Reed, and officials changed the hospital's commanding officer twice in as many days.
15661	20519	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.

15664	20522	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news articles have hinted at similar problems for years.
15665	20523	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
15666	20524	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"You're not going to be able to Scotch tape over it," he said.
15667	20525	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
15668	20526	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We really need to reinvent this process," Kiley said.
15669	20527	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
15670	20528	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He was pressed on Monday to explain how he had not known about the conditions at Building 18, even though he lived across the street from it.
15671	20529	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He explained that inspections of barracks were not part of his normal job duties.
15672	20530	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But the subcommittee members continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to civilians had left the hospital depleted.
15673	20531	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.
15674	20532	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Beyond specific steps to streamline the bureaucratic process that is faced by wounded troops and to improve living conditions, military officials said it may be time to re-evaluate whether Walter Reed should be closed in several years, as had been previously planned as part of a national base reorganization process.
15675	20533	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Several patients at Walter Reed attended the hearing Monday and echoed some of the problems described.

15682	20541	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	Ma Ying-jeou, candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), is in favor of friendly ties with the mainland and has called for a further liberalisation and raising of the investment ceilings.
15683	20542	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	The KMT scored a landslide victory in the January 12 parliamentary vote and the win prompted the pro-independence DPP to amend its China policy, observers said.
15684	20543	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	DPP candidate Frank Hsieh also says the government should review restrictions and permit investments to China on a case-by-case basis instead of applying the 40 percent limit across the board.
15685	20545	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	China took some 41 percent of the island's total exports in the first 11 months of last year.
15686	20546	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	The two sides split in 1949 after a civil war, and while the island has since governed itself, Beijing considers it part of its own territory awaiting reunification.

15688	20549	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.
15689	20550	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Now back on the force, extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
15690	20552	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	In between bites of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he hates cops.
15691	20553	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is helpless when it comes to all the technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
15692	20554	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations, Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top of a gusher of emotion.
15693	20555	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The guy spent more than a decade in prison among inmates who don't exactly take kindly to cops
15694	20556	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	we can tell that his lightheartedness is but a thin veneer.
15695	20557	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And when he's interrogating suspects, his fury clearly rears its head.
15696	20558	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Is Charlie about to go off the deep end?
15697	20559	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis, with his red hair, pale face, and nonchalant expression, is compelling as he toys with Charlie's balance.
15698	20561	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is surrounded by a distinctive cast.
15699	20562	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Sarah Shahi, from "The L Word" and the "Sopranos" episode in which Tony ate magic mushrooms, is likable as Charlie's untrusting new partner.
15700	20563	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Robin Weigart, who was Calamity Jane on "Deadwood," exudes a strong but ambiguous presence as the lieutenant.
15701	20564	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And Adam Arkin is sweet as Charlie's former cellmate who now lives above the garage at Charlie's mansion.
15702	20565	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in 1994, is promising.
15703	20566	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	While each episode will focus on a particular criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually.
15704	20567	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	After one episode, I was already curious about what landed Charlie in jail.
15705	20568	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The premiere is presented partly as a documentary about Charlie, on the occasion of his release from jail, and clearly some of those featured in the reel were responsible for his incarceration.
15706	20569	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not long for the world?
15707	20570	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	For one thing, as good as Lewis is, Charlie may be too strange for mainstream consumption.
15708	20571	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He's a hard character to understand, although I am certain that, ultimately, he is understandable.
15709	20572	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first place.
15710	20573	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or "the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.
15711	20574	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Up against "CSI: NY" and "Dirty Sexy Money," the lifespan of "Life" will likely be short.

15722	20586	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, it seems, we're getting hit from all directions.
15723	20587	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Energy and food prices are soaring.
15724	20588	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to collapse.
15725	20589	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Government revenue is falling, and taxes are rising.
15726	20590	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service.
15727	20591	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Banks are pulling credit lines.
15728	20592	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Auto companies are cutting production once again.
15729	20593	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Even investment bankers are losing their jobs.
15730	20594	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The tendency is to see these as separate developments, each with its own causes and dynamic.
15731	20595	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
15732	20596	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.
15733	20597	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the bubble has burst, we are coming to accept the reality of lower prices, reduced production, declining homeownership rates and the wisdom that a house is not an ATM or a substitute for a retirement fund.
15734	20598	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
15735	20599	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real estate.
15736	20601	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Unlike housing, which began losing steam two years ago, these other sectors have just begun the painful process of repricing and finding a new balance between supply and demand.
15737	20602	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Take the case of the airline industry, which likes to blame its woes on skyrocketing fuel prices.
15738	20603	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	While there's an ongoing debate about why the price of oil has doubled over the past year, there is little doubt that the declining dollar is a significant factor.
15739	20604	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The decline is the result of years of large and growing U.S. trade deficits that should have caused the exchange rate to adjust years ago but didn't because so many of our trading partners in Asia and the Middle East were intent on linking their currencies to the dollar.
15740	20605	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	In the process of maintaining those dollar pegs and reinvesting those surpluses in Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, they created a surfeit of cheap credit that spawned all those bubbles.
15741	20606	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
15742	20607	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
15743	20608	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Producers have raised their dollar prices to prevent a decline in the global purchasing power from their commodities sales.
15744	20609	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
15745	20610	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At some point, that speculative bubble will burst and energy prices will plunge.
15746	20611	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	When things finally settle down, the new equilibrium price is almost certain to be well above where it was last year at this time.
15747	20612	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem.
15748	20613	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
15749	20614	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That includes such things as cleaning planes
15750	20615	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	handling reservations, check-ins and baggage without undue waiting
15751	20616	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	serving a decent meal when necessary
15752	20617	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	and treating passengers fairly when flights are canceled.
15753	20618	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But they also include costs that may be less obvious, like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs, paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
15754	20619	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
15755	20620	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
15756	20621	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
15757	20622	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
15758	20624	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And you can add a third blow, this one from government.
15759	20625	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Across the country, state and local governments are already hip- deep into budget crises in response to declining revenue from property assessments and real estate transfers.
15760	20626	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Here in Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as the eye can see.
15761	20627	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble.
15762	20628	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Despite the happy talk you might be hearing from the presidential candidates, it presents Americans with a stark and unpleasant choice.
15763	20629	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	One option is to raise taxes and leave less money for private spending, which is what many state and local governments have begun to do.
15764	20630	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
15765	20631	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Either way, it amounts to a lower standard of living than we thought we had achieved.
15766	20632	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Is all this the end of the world?
15767	20633	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the richest country on the planet, certainly not.
15768	20634	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But it does represent the end of a decade or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world -- and by their own leaders -- to live way beyond their means.
15769	20635	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	As a result, the United States has gone from being the largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor.
15770	20636	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the first time since the early 1980s, Americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the U.S. economy regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and sustainable growth.

15773	20639	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	A University of Washington professor says a recently discovered fish that crawls instead of swimming and has forward-looking eyes like humans could be part of an entirely unknown family of fishes.
15774	20641	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	It uses its leglike pectoral fins to burrow into cracks and crevices of coral reefs in search of food.
15775	20642	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	UW professor Ted Pietsch says this relative of the anglerfish will have to undergo DNA scrutiny to verify that it is unique.
15776	20643	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	But the world's leading authority on anglerfish says he's never seen anything like it.
15777	20644	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	Pietsch says they have probably escaped notice until now because they are so good at sliding into narrow crevices.

15779	20646	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, topping the agenda of a meeting of alliance defence ministers Thursday, now comprises almost 35,500 troops.
15780	20647	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to official figures released Wednesday.
15781	20648	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had rotated among different nations every six months.
15782	20649	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO expanded its operations from Kabul and the relatively quiet north and west of the conflict-torn country, to the south and east, where a resurgent Taliban militia has opposed it.
15783	20651	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Its fighters seized control of one town last week.
15784	20652	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Britain, along with Canada -- with 2,500 troops -- and the Netherlands, 2,200, have born the brunt of the fighting in the Taliban's heartland in the south, and NATO commanders have urged the allies to inject more resources.
15785	20653	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	On the eve of the NATO meeting in Seville, Germany announced plans to deploy six reconnaissance jets -- and the 500 personnel needed to run them -- but it insists they will play no combat role.
15786	20655	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Poland has started deploying around 1,000 troops, which are likely to be in place by April.
15787	20657	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Officials say, though, that no new offers are likely to be made in Seville.
15788	20659	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The way it plays out could determine the future of the 60-year- old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations, or more modestly just peacekeeping and reconstruction.
15789	20660	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	ISAF troop numbers fluctuate constantly as troops are deployed, rotated, replaced or simply withdrawn from the country.

15855	20738	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama momentum mounts in Democratic White House race
15856	20739	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's White House drive picked up pace Friday with more superdelegates rallying to his side, including the head of a leading union, as former rival John Edwards all but endorsed his campaign.
15857	20740	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Since Obama's convincing win in North Carolina on Tuesday over rival Hillary Clinton and their photo-finish finale in Indiana, nine more of the Democratic Party elite with free votes on the nomination contest have swung over to the Illinois senator.
15858	20741	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	The trickle of support is predicted to turn into a flood, with only six primaries now left in their marathon battle to carry the party's flag into the November presidential elections against Republican John McCain.
15859	20742	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Edwards, who dropped out of the close race in late January, stopped short of endorsing Obama on Friday, but said he has virtually wrapped up the contest, ahead of the last primaries on June 3.
15860	20743	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"Let's just assume that Barack is the nominee because it's headed in that direction," he told NBC television.
15861	20744	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He added he thought Obama, who is on a historic quest to be the country's first black president, also had a "better chance" to beat McCain.
15862	20745	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	While the former first lady had fought a good campaign, "the problem is the numbers," Edwards said, referring to the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the party's nomination.
15863	20746	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who is also seeking to make history by being the first woman elected to the Oval Office, trails behind Obama in the number of pledged delegates to the party's nominating convention in August.
15864	20747	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And while she still holds the lead in the number of superdelegates, whose vote will be decisive in who wins the party nomination, Obama is hot on her heels.
15865	20748	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Independent pollsters RealClearPolitics.com on Friday put Obama ahead with 1,854 delegates, including 265 superdelegates, compared to 1,696 for Clinton, who has pocketed some 272 superdelegates.
15866	20749	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	That leaves more than 250 superdelegates still uncommitted, at least publicly.
15867	20750	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In a further blow to Clinton's White House hopes, another one of the party grandees defected from her side Friday.
15868	20751	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs," Congressman Donald Payne told the Newark Star-Ledger.
15869	20752	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And three other superdelegates also came out for Obama.
15870	20753	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	His campaign announced that Ed Espinoza, a Democratic National Committee member from California, was backing Obama, while The Oregonian reported that Representative Peter Defazio pledged his support to him.
15871	20756	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"We think the country needs change and we think now is the time."
15872	20758	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, however, has vowed no surrender and plunged straight back into campaigning before the May 13 primary in West Virginia, where she is favored in polls.
15873	20759	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	On Friday she was in Oregon, which will hold its primary along with Kentucky on May 20.
15874	20760	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he could declare victory after the May 20 primaries which may put him over the top, in terms of elected delegates.
15875	20761	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In that event, "we can make a pretty strong claim that we have got the most runs and it's the ninth inning and we have won," Obama said Thursday, using a baseball analogy.
15876	20762	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In another sign of his growing stature, Obama was mobbed by Democratic lawmakers during an unannounced visit to Congress on Thursday.
15877	20763	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	At least 10 superdelegates escorted him out of one meeting, jostling to get into the camera shot with him, despite not having publicly announced their support.
15878	20765	AFP_ENG_20070125.0424.LDC2009T13	One person was killed and about 20 more injured in clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim demonstrators in Beirut on Thursday, hospital sources said.
15879	20770	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Army was called out and curfew imposed in the city of Parachinar, the capital of tribal Kurram Agency, some 290 km west of the capital, Islamabad after the clashes took place on Friday.
15880	20772	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Clashes started when a group of Shia people took out a procession in Parachinar and chanted slogans against the Sunnis days ago, according to the News Network International (NNI) news agency.
15881	20773	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Anees said that two helicopters hit positions of both sides from where shots were being fired.
15882	20774	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	He said that the army and paramilitary militia have started joint patrolling, adding that there would be no relaxation in curfew.
15883	20775	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Geo reported that the authorities have issued shoot-at-sight order if any one tried to violate curfew.
15884	20776	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Fighting had also spread to adjoining areas of the city and both sides were used heavy weapons, and a delegation of tribal elders has been sent to the area to broker a ceasefire, according to NNI.
15885	20781	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	With its announcement, the FME made clear the new bank, called New Kaupthing, would take over all the old bank's domestic assets, while its international operations had been separated to be sold off.
15886	20783	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	According to the FME, the new bank's equity will be 75 billion kronur (500 million euros, 641 million dollars) and the size of its balance sheet 700 billion kronur.
15887	20784	AFP_ENG_20081022.0145.LDC2009T13	The authority had announced a similar procedure for Glitnir last week.
15888	20787	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	A bridge collapsed under an overloaded truck in Guinea, throwing scores of passengers into a river and killing at least 70, the West African country's state radio reported Wednesday.
15889	20788	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The truck was ferrying merchandise and people back from a local market near the southeastern town of Gueckedou when the accident occurred Sunday, state-run RTG radio reported.
15890	20789	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The 50-year-old rock and cement bridge collapsed as the truck was crossing, tipping the vehicle and sending people as well as bags of cement and sacks of rice crashing into the river.
15891	20790	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Many of the dead drowned, trapped under the merchandise, RTG said.
15892	20791	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	At least 20 people were injured and were taken to hospital, the radio station reported.
15893	20792	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Some later died of their injuries.
15894	20793	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The death toll rose from 65 overnight to 70 Wednesday morning, the radio said, citing hospital sources.
15895	20794	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Hospital officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
15896	20796	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	In rural areas where buses are rare, large open-backed trucks are often a main form of transport -- carrying sacks of grain, sheep, bicycles and people between villages.
15897	20797	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Trucks are often piled high with merchandise, and then passengers climb on top, or hang onto the sides of the vehicle.
15898	20798	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	JEEP WRANGLER LESS ROUGH, STILL READY
15899	20799	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Whether planning to drive up the beach on South Padre Island in Texas or on the red-rock trails of Utah's stunningly beautiful Arches National Park, the newest generation of the Jeep Wrangler might very well be the best way to go.
15900	20800	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
15901	20801	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Jeep rolled out the redesigned Wrangler, whose roots can be traced back to the military jeeps used by the U.S. armed forces during World
15902	20802	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	War II.
15903	20803	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	This latest version, though, is a lot more refined than even the previous model, let alone those rather crude early military models.
15904	20804	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable doors.
15905	20805	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Another innovation: Jeep added the first four-door version to the lineup with the redesign -- the model called the Wrangler Unlimited.
15906	20806	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	While some Jeep purists might complain that the newest Wrangler is too gentrified for their tastes, I don't agree.
15907	20807	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	I appreciate having a somewhat comfortable as well as ultimately capable vehicle to take me into the places most people never will see.
15908	20808	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What's important is that the Wrangler's styling remains true to the brand, something Chrysler's designers clearly understood when they created the new generation.
15909	20809	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler still has the signature shape, seven-slot grille, round headlights, trapezoid-shaped wheel flares, exposed door and windshield hinges, and a windshield that can be folded down.
15910	20810	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Changes to the exterior were subtle and included a new molded front bumper with integrated fog lights and sealed headlights with 20 percent brighter halogen bulbs.
15911	20811	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The current Wrangler is 5 inches wider than before, with a track that is 3.5 inches wider.
15912	20812	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The extra width was added to increase interior space, but might be a problem on really narrow trails, such as the ones in Washington state that are used for the annual Cascades Jeep Jamboree.
15913	20813	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	But for most trails, the extra width won't get in the way.
15914	20814	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family.
15915	20815	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The back seat is meant for just two, and there is virtually no cargo space behind the seat.
15916	20816	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
15917	20817	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There still is room only for four people in the two-door model, but the front seats now have 4.6 inches more hip room and 5.1 inches more shoulder room.
15918	20818	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Rear seats have 3.9 inches of additional shoulder room, 1.6 inches more hip room and an inch more legroom.
15919	20819	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
15920	20820	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it -- 46.4 cubic feet.
15921	20821	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The four-door has a 116-inch-wheelbase versus 95.4 inches for the standard-length Wrangler, and it's 20.6 inches longer.
15922	20822	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Even with all of the changes -- including the quietest cabin ever in a Jeep -- the Wrangler still has the off-road abilities that have made the Wrangler the preferred vehicle of serious four- wheel-drive enthusiasts.
15923	20823	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	In fact, the automaker says the new model offers even more off- road prowess than its predecessor.
15924	20824	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The newest Wrangler has more ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems.
15925	20825	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Also added were optional electric axle lockers and an electrically operated disconnecting sway bar.
15926	20826	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and the Rubicon.
15927	20827	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield combinations, Jeep said.
15928	20828	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base price $28,190 plus $700 freight).
15929	20829	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Ours didn't come with the optional hardtop or the glass power windows
15930	20830	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	we had the canvas top, traditional half-doors and zip-down plastic windows.
15931	20831	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	We didn't have the power door locks, either.
15932	20832	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What we did have was the Rubicon's great off-road equipment, which includes
15933	20833	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep's Off-Road Rock-Trac transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, as well as the front and rear electronic axle lockers, the sway-bar system and 32-inch B.F. Goodrich off-road tires.
15934	20834	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter.
15935	20835	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Suspension improvements include advanced shock tuning.
15936	20836	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wranglers -- both the two- and four-door models -- come with a choice of removable hard or soft tops.
15937	20837	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Among those is a three- piece modular top, whose two front sections can be stored inside the vehicle after being removed.
15938	20838	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A new "Sunrider" soft top includes a sunroof feature that allows it to open partially.
15939	20839	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	It also can be removed completely to turn the vehicle into a convertible.
15940	20840	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Powering all Wranglers is a 3.8-liter V-6 engine rated at 202 horsepower and 237 foot-pounds of torque.
15941	20841	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, no four-cylinder is offered, which probably was a mistake considering what has happened with gasoline prices.
15942	20842	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.
15943	20843	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	EPA ratings are 15 miles per gallon city/19 highway with either gearbox for the four-wheel-drive models and 15/20 for the two- wheel-drive model.
15944	20844	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	New for 2009, Hill Start Assist is standard on all 2009 Jeep Wrangler models to prevent rollback on graded surfaces.
15945	20845	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Nine exterior colors are offered, and wheel choices include 16-, 17- and 18-inch versions.

15949	20849	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The only extras on our test vehicle were the automatic transmission ($825), navigation system ($1,275), trailer-towing package ($270) and "deep water blue pearl coat" paint ($225).
15950	20850	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Total sticker price was $31,485, including freight and options.
15951	20851	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The trailer package now includes Trailer Sway Control, which Jeep says monitors the vehicle's movement relative to the driver's intended path and activates the stability control system if the trailer begins to sway.

15953	20854	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Johnny Frigo, a versatile jazz violinist and bassist who toured with Jimmy Dorsey and co-wrote the jazz standard "Detour Ahead," has died, according to his son.
15954	20855	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	He was 90.
15955	20856	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Frigo died early Wednesday at a Chicago hospital after battling cancer in recent years, said his son Rick Frigo.
15956	20858	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	After playing with the U.S. Coast Guard band at Ellis Island during World War II, he toured with clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra.
15957	20859	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Around that time, Frigo wrote "Detour Ahead" with Lou Carter and Herb Ellis, a song that became a jazz standard recorded by Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan, among others.
15958	20860	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	He was in his late 60s or early 70s when he turned his attention to the violin, appearing twice on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson.
15959	20861	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	"Nobody played violin like him," said his son.
15960	20862	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	"Chicago's a poorer place without him."
15961	20863	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Frigo was also a poet and artist with a keen sense of humor, his son said.
15962	20864	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	When Carson asked him why he had waited so long to launch his jazz violin career, he replied that he did not want there to be enough time for him to become a has-been, his son said.

15969	20873	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	At least 30 miners were feared trapped after an accident Saturday at a coal mine in northeast China, state media reported.
15970	20874	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	Some 44 miners were working underground at the mine in Hegang, Heilongjiang province, when the accident occurred at around 4:00 am, Xinhua news agency said, quoting local authorities.
15971	20875	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	Around a dozen miners escaped but more than 30 could be trapped in the mine, it said.
15972	20876	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately known what caused the accident.
15973	20877	AFP_ENG_20080920.0463.LDC2009T13	China's coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world, with safety standards often ignored in the quest for profits and the drive to meet surging demand for coal -- the source of about 70 percent of the country's energy.
15974	20879	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	EU to resume Gaza fuel aid after days of blackouts
15975	20882	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	No further details were immediately available.
15976	20883	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU suspended financing fuel deliveries for Gaza's power plant -- which provides some 25 percent of electricity in the territory -- over fears that Hamas would benefit from the aid.
15977	20884	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU blacklists Hamas as a terror group and refuses to have any dealings with the Islamists.
15978	20885	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	If it provides fuel to a power plant, and Hamas earns money from that plant's production, the bloc could be seen to be indirectly financing the movement.
15979	20886	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
15980	20887	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
15981	20888	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would function independently.
15982	20890	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
15983	20891	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
15984	20893	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
15985	20894	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	He said the fuel cuts were "the result of the illegal takeover of control electricity company by the Hamas putschists, and the collecting of citizens' (electricity) bills to pay members of its militia."
15986	20895	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
15987	20896	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15, with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.
15988	20897	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Egypt, which provides between five and 10 percent of Gaza's electricity, said the supplies should not be used for political ends.

16003	20918	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Providing a perfect forum for them is "The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child," an annual started in 1945 by Anna Freud, the icon's psychoanalyst daughter, and her colleagues.
16004	20919	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The title seems to suggest that it only pertains to children, but actually, it brims with articles of great human interest and originality on topics that range from infancy to grandfatherhood, from the origins of aggression to the mysteries of human resilience.

16020	20938	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The barrier island community of Galveston is not ready for residents to return even briefly to the city thrashed by Hurricane Ike, officials said Thursday as they pleaded for at least another week to make repairs.
16021	20939	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Ike's death toll in the U.S. stood at 53, with 19 in Texas.
16022	20940	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	In the Caribbean, Ike killed more than 80 people.
16023	20941	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Many of the city's services -- including water, sewer and power -- are recovering but remain several days away from returning to full function, City Manager Steve LeBlanc said.
16024	20942	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The only hospital on the island is getting some power, but not enough to care for the 60,000 residents of Galveston Island.
16025	20943	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The extra strain placed on the city by the return of residents would only slow the recovery effort, LeBlanc said.
16026	20944	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We don't have adequate water at this point for just taking a shower, flushing a toilet," he said.
16027	20945	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We're not there yet."
16028	20946	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Authorities let residents and business owners back onto the island briefly Tuesday to "look and leave," but quickly reversed course after the decision created traffic jams that backed up for miles Tuesday and Wednesday on Interstate 45, the only road onto the island.
16029	20947	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Officials ruled out a resumption of that policy Thursday.
16030	20949	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We just want to bring everyone home, and we'll try to do it next week."
16031	20950	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Thomas told residents that by waiting they were "making it possible for us to get you home in a week or so, instead of the months it would take if the city's infrastructure were more overwhelmed at this point."
16032	20951	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Roughly 15,000 residents defied forecasters' warning of "certain death" to ride out the storm on the barrier island, and many remained there despite the repeated urgings of officials -- worried about threats that include mosquito-borne disease -- to get out.
16033	20952	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are clear signs of life returning to Galveston.

16048	20968	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	EU to propose deep cuts in new car emissions
16049	20969	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for cleaner air.
16050	20971	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	New passenger cars currently emit about 160 grammes of CO2 per kilometre.
16051	20972	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Under the proposal, auto makers would be required to limit average emissions across their fleet to 130 grammes per kilometer by improving the technology they use.
16052	20973	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	A further 10 grammes would be cut through requirements on tyre, equipment and fuel makers to improve air-conditioning efficiency, tyre pressure monitoring and gear shift indicators while increasing the use of biofuels and other measures.
16053	20974	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	With car makers failing to meet existing voluntary targets, the commission was in agreement that binding limits were needed, but Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen were divided over how much an effort should come from car makers.
16054	20975	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Dimas sought a tough binding limit of 120 grammes for car makers while Verheugen wanted measures to be shared with tyre, equipment and fuel makers, easing the burden on the automobile industry, which he says employs 12 million people directly or indirectly in Europe.
16055	20976	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The compromise proposal is to be officially presented after its adoption by other commissioners.
16056	20977	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission is aiming to present by the end of the year formal legislation that will then have to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.
16057	20978	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European car industry is up in arms about the proposals, which it says could force them to relocate production elsewhere.
16058	20979	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European car industry association said in a statement.
16059	20980	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"It will lead to a loss of jobs and a relocation of production outside Europe," it added.
16060	20982	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission says they have so far only decreased emissions by 12.4 percent, which the EU executive describes as "not satisfactory."
16061	20983	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Road transport pollution has risen 30 percent since 1990 and now makes up more than a quarter of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions, with half of that from passenger cars.
16062	20984	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission's hesitation to bring forward plans on car emissions cast a shadow over a recent drive to fight climate change, which was one of the main planks of a wide-ranging energy action plan it unveiled last month.
16063	20985	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Just a month ago, the EU unveiled its new energy strategy to great fanfare, with claims that the EU was going to play a real global leadership role -- and yet here we see it falling at the first hurdle, failing at the first test," said Green euro-deputy Caroline Lucas.

16152	21107	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"The 2009 Business Plan holds TNK-BP production broadly flat on 2008, with capital expenditure for the year of 3.3 billion dollars," the company said in a statement after a board of directors meeting.
16153	21108	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"In 2009 the company plans to produce 600 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year," it added.
16154	21109	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	A company spokesperson confirmed that capital expenditure in 2008 had been 4.4 billion dollars.
16155	21110	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	The meeting of the board of directors of TNK-BP Limited -- the holding company for the TNK-BP group -- came after an accord that ended months of wrangling between its shareholders over control of the firm.
16156	21111	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	It said that for the full year 2008 it remained on track to deliver its best financial performance since the company's creation despite poor market conditions in the fourth quarter.
16157	21114	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	Tim Summers had been appointed interim chief executive until a new appointment is agreed by the shareholders but the statement said that the nomination of a new permanent CEO was not on the agenda at the meeting.
16158	21115	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"The Board also reviewed progress of the top management and governance transition currently underway inside TNK-BP."
16159	21116	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"However, there was no discussion or nomination of any individual candidate as the company’s next permanent CEO."
16160	21121	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	"This was one incident and one individual's views, but if you look at the direction we are heading in Iraq now, it's a very, very positive direction and we hope to see that continue," he said.
16161	21126	AFP_ENG_20081215.0118.LDC2009T13	"If you look at what we have done over the last several years with regard to improving the security situation in Iraq and in terms of helping Iraq along the path of democracy

16164	21132	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, 26, spoke publicly for the first time about the events of Nov. 19, 2005, in an interview with the CBS' "60 Minutes," scheduled for broadcast Sunday night.
16165	21133	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's squad.
16166	21134	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	He said they tried to run from the car, instead of obeying an order not to.
16167	21135	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Normally the Iraqis know the drill.
16168	21136	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	If something happens, get down, hands up," Wuterich told CBS.
16169	21137	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"They started to take off, so I shot at them."
16170	21138	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The Washington Post.
16171	21139	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	In January, the newspaper ran a story that said witnesses told investigators that the men did not run away and Wuterich shot them as they stood, unarmed, by the taxi about 10 feet (3 meters) in front of him.
16172	21141	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich was charged in December with 13 counts of unpremeditated murder.
16173	21142	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Three other squad members also were charged with unpremeditated murder and four officers were charged with failing to properly investigate or report the killings.
16174	21143	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Tedesco said it is not unusual for a "60 Minutes" story to take months to report before it is broadcast.
16175	21144	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's attorney Neal Puckett did not comment on the CBS interview and declined an Associated Press request to speak to Wuterich.
16176	21145	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Following the taxi shooting, Wuterich said, he was given permission from a superior officer to raid a house suspected to have a sniper inside.
16177	21146	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marines did this using grenades and gunfire, according the CBS News release.
16178	21147	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he knew women and children were killed in that house, but he didn't stop the assault because he saw an open doorway leading toward a second house and believed the sniper had escaped through it.
16179	21148	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"My responsibility as a squad leader is to make sure that none of the rest of my guys died," Wuterich told CBS.
16180	21149	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was sorry women and children died, but he believes he was acting according to how he had been trained.
16181	21150	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Did we know that civilians were in there?
16182	21151	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	No," Wuterich told CBS.
16183	21152	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"We cleared these houses the way they were supposed to be cleared."
16184	21153	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marine sergeant said he regretted the deaths.
16185	21154	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"There is nothing that I can possibly say to make up or make well the deaths of those women and children, and I am absolutely sorry it happened that day," Wuterich told CBS.
16186	21155	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"What I did that day, the decision that I made, I would make those decisions again today.
16187	21156	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Those are decisions that I made in a combat situation and I believe I had to make those decisions."

16200	21178	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	After that, we're not sure," said meteorologist Rebecca Waddington at the National Hurricane Center.
16201	21179	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"For that reason, everyone in the Gulf needs to be monitoring the storm."
16202	21180	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	New Orleans began planning a possible mandatory evacuation, hoping to prevent the chaos it saw after Hurricane Katrina struck three years ago Friday.
16203	21182	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Any damage to the Gulf oil infrastructure could send U.S. gasoline prices spiking.

16219	21204	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Like other major biotechnology companies, Biogen Idec Inc. has a cadre of talented scientists working feverishly to discover breakthrough drugs.
16220	21205	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Over the years, the Cambridge biotech has also made acquisitions, established a $105 million venture fund, and licensed promising technologies to build a pipeline of potential life-saving therapies.
16221	21206	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Now, Biogen Idec is trying a new approach: setting up an incubator to help biotech start-ups get off the ground by providing them with funding, technical expertise, and office and laboratory space near its Kendall Square headquarters.
16222	21207	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	After spending more than a year getting the incubator ready, Biogen Idec plans to disclose Wednesdaythat it has signed up its first tenant, Escoublac, a new company based on research from a Columbia University researcher.
16223	21208	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	It hopes to unveil its second tenant next month.
16224	21210	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	As the biotech revolution matures, Biogen Idec and other companies are trying to find creative ways to get in on the ground floor of promising research developed outside their laboratories.
16225	21211	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	A few, like Biogen Idec, are setting up corporate incubators.
16226	21212	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant, recently committed to spending up to $10 million a year on a new biotech incubator in La Jolla, Calif., near San Diego, and is considering setting up another incubator in Massachusetts or another biotech hot spot.
16227	21213	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In addition, Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge said it is considering stepping up investments in young companies or setting up an incubator of its own.
16228	21215	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We've been actively considering ideas on how we might establish some form of incubator complex."
16229	21216	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Others are using a different strategy.
16230	21217	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans Wednesday to say it has struck an unusual deal with Harvard University to fund research projects related to cancer, infectious diseases, and other areas Vertex is interested in - with few strings attached.
16231	21218	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The Cambridge biotech company said Harvard researchers will be able to publish their results freely and retain the rights to any technology they develop - something barred by some corporate research funders.
16232	21220	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a total of several million dollars over three years.
16233	21221	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	If Harvard decides to license any technology developed, Vertex said it has the option to license it first.
16234	21222	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model," Boger said.
16235	21223	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Fuchs said Biogen Idec hopes to house up to four or five companies in its biotech incubator within two years.
16236	21224	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
16237	21225	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone biology and metabolism.
16238	21226	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The company hopes to pioneer new treatments for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity, which have been on the increase in the United States.
16239	21227	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Fuchs said Biogen Idec plans to give each company in its incubator between $3 million and $10 million in seed funding over several years, dedicated office and laboratory space, administrative support, and technical expertise.
16240	21228	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In return, Biogen Idec will receive stock in the companies and an option to eventually buy the rest at a prenegotiated price.
16241	21229	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Two local venture capitalists were enthusiastic about Biogen Idec's endeavor.
16242	21230	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"I'm a big fan of what they are doing," said Terry McGuire, managing general partner of Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham.
16243	21231	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"There's always a shortage of capital for the early stage stuff."
16244	21232	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Peter Feinstein, general partner of BioVentures Investors in Cambridge, said he thought Biogen Idec could help invigorate its research programs by bringing in entrepreneurs with new ideas.
16245	21233	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It like having puppies around an older dog," Feinstein said.
16246	21234	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Walts, however, said one concern with a corporate incubator is that it could hurt start-ups' ability to work with other drug companies.
16247	21235	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	So, he said, Genzyme is considering setting up a "virtual incubator" instead.
16248	21236	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Genzyme would provide seed funding and technical support to new ventures, but would not physically house the companies on its property.
16249	21237	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	That way, the companies might be better able to forge their own identities.
16250	21238	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Regardless, Walts said, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Vertex share a common goal: finding new ways to tap into early-stage drug research.
16251	21239	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which approach works best.

16269	21260	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack grittiness."
16270	21261	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I'm not talking about having enforcers
16271	21262	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	it's more banging in the corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their opponents," Green said.
16272	21263	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They won't make it if they don't find a way to get that."
16273	21264	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1 when trailing after the first period.
16274	21265	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"The games they've won they've had the lead from the first period on," Panthers announcer Denis Potvin said.
16275	21266	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They've got to be winning third periods.
16276	21267	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You can go into the third period down by one or two and still win that period.
16277	21268	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	(They) haven't been winning that period."
16278	21269	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have been outscored 61-47 in the final 20 minutes.
16279	21270	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Vanbiesbrouck said he also has been disappointed by the production of several secondary scorers, most notably Nathan Horton (12 goals, 26 assists) and Stephen Weiss (9 goals, 20 assists).
16280	21271	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While they rank second and third on the team in points, neither has had the breakout year many expected.
16281	21272	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score," Vanbiesbrouck said.
16282	21273	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Weiss said: "I want to have more points.
16283	21274	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	It's not for lack of chances.
16284	21275	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I just have to bear down in the crease area, make sure pucks are going in the net."
16285	21276	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"You've got to have two lines scoring," Potvin said.
16286	21277	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One could make the argument that when the Jokinen line was going the Weiss line was not, or the Weiss line was going and the Jokinen line wasn't.
16287	21278	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	One line just isn't enough."
16288	21279	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost, Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
16289	21280	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Potvin also said players have to take it upon themselves to stop being whistled for untimely penalties.
16290	21282	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Several players conceded that the team is maddeningly inconsistent.
16291	21283	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Early, late, or sometimes in the middle of games, a loss of focus will prompt a salvo of opposition shots that often as not overwhelm goalie Tomas Vokoun.
16292	21284	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some games we're slower at the beginning, then pick it up," defenseman Ruslan Salei said.
16293	21285	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some we play well from the beginning.
16294	21286	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I can't give an answer why."
16295	21287	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Jokinen also is perplexed.
16296	21288	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One night it's there, the next it isn't," he said.
16297	21289	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's 31 games now.
16298	21290	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	We have to make up our mind
16299	21291	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	we really have to buy into this or we're just going to waste another year."
16300	21292	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	If that happens and Columbus makes the playoffs - the Blue Jackets returned from the break tied for eighth in the West - the Panthers would become the only team in the league to fail to reach the post-season since 2000.

16311	21308	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
16312	21309	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	BEREA, Ohio -- Five weeks ago, the Cleveland Browns had three quarterbacks, but they really didn't have any.
16313	21310	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Now, they have what could be their quarterback of the future and, amazingly enough, it's not necessarily Brady Quinn.
16314	21311	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	The Browns are averaging 32 points per game in the five games quarterback Derek Anderson has started.
16315	21312	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	They are 3-2 in those games and 3-3 overall heading into their bye week.
16316	21313	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	What to make of Anderson?
16317	21314	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a guy on a roll?

16319	21316	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Something in between?
16320	21317	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Anderson can be a restricted free agent at the end of the season, so the Browns will use the rest of the season to get a handle on what they actually have.
16321	21318	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"He's going to continue to get better," tight end Steve Heiden said Monday.
16322	21319	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"That's the exciting part."
16323	21320	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	Anderson threw three touchdown passes to Braylon Edwards in Sunday's 41-31 victory over the winless Miami Dolphins.
16324	21321	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	He also scored a touchdown and made none of the mistakes that tended to cast doubt upon him in the preseason, causing the Browns to open the season with the since-traded Charlie Frye under center.
16325	21323	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's too early to say he's Tom Brady or Tom Brady-like or anything like that.
16326	21324	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	He's gotten an opportunity, and he's running with it.
16327	21325	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	I knew he was capable.
16328	21326	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	It's not really surprising."
16329	21327	NYT_ENG_20071015.0116.LDC2009T13	And the other candidate for 'quarterback of the future' can do nothing but watch.

16336	21334	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Kevin Millwood appears ready to rejoin the Rangers.
16337	21335	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood allowed just one hit in five innings Sunday during a rehab assignment with the Double A RoughR iders at Dr Pepper Ballpark.
16338	21337	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I felt like I was putting it where I wanted to, for the most part," Millwood said.
16339	21338	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I was mainly trying to make sure my pitch count got up and my hamstring felt fine."
16340	21339	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood, who is 2-4 with a 6.62 ERA in 35 1/3 innings, injured his left hamstring May 14 in a start against the Angels.
16341	21340	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Earlier in May he strained the hamstring during practice.
16342	21341	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He's eligible to come of the disabled list Wednesday.
16343	21342	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	After his first three pitches Sunday missed the strike zone, Millwood settled down and struck out the leadoff batter .
16344	21343	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He allowed just two baserunners on a walk and a double.
16345	21344	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He had three strikeouts and his fastball routinely hit 90-92 mph.
16346	21345	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I felt a little out of sorts, but I think the biggest thing was just getting some pitches in," Millwood said. "
16347	21346	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	(My pitches) were fine.
16348	21347	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Nothing was horrible, so that was good.
16349	21348	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	I threw my fastball wherever I wanted to, for the most part, and that's key for me."
16350	21349	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Rangers bullpen coach Dom Chiti, who was with Millwood in Frisco, said the pitcher proved he's healthy.
16351	21350	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I think he's ready to go," Chiti said.
16352	21351	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Kevin showed everyone that he's healthy and his leg was fine.
16353	21352	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	We started seeing the velocity, and he located (his pitches ).

16356	21355	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston says the pain from a bulging disk, which was pinching a nerve in his neck and put him on the disabled list, has subsided.
16357	21356	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	" (Sunday) was probably the best I've felt in a long time," he said.
16358	21357	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Especially the last three at bats -- even the strikeout -- I felt great.
16359	21358	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	It's just good to be back playing again."
16360	21359	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston hopes to be back with the Rangers in Seattle after receiving a cortisone shot Tuesday and playing a game or two in Oklahoma City.

16405	21418	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular administration.
16406	21419	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
16407	21420	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign quickly released a television advertisement after the disclosure that one financial giant, Lehman Brothers, had filed for bankruptcy and another, Merrill Lynch &amp
16408	21421	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Co., Inc., had been bought out.
16409	21422	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Our economy in crisis.
16410	21423	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it," the ad said.
16411	21424	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On the campaign trail in Florida, however, McCain sounded a slightly different note when he said the fundamentals of the economy remained "strong."
16412	21425	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The Obama campaign immediately pounced on that as evidence that McCain is out of touch with ordinary people.
16413	21427	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning.
16414	21428	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The past week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."
16415	21429	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For months, Obama has been calling for increased regulation and accountability for financial institutions.
16416	21430	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector.
16417	21431	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections, loosened oversight and regulation, and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans have brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression," Obama's statement said.
16418	21432	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain signaled some openness to increased regulation of financial institutions to increase transparency of their dealings -- though he was more cautious than Obama.
16419	21433	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."
16420	21434	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
16421	21435	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
16422	21436	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
16423	21437	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
16424	21439	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"If you are a Republican, you should be tagged on the economy.
16425	21440	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	If there is such a thing as Republican Teflon, McCain enjoys it on this matter."
16426	21441	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.
16427	21443	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine.
16428	21444	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Would you?"
16429	21446	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	In a statement Monday, the group called the Lehman collapse and the Merrill Lynch sale "perfect examples" of how a privatization would "turn Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed gamble."

16432	21451	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The ANPP's plan was made on Thursday after it resolved differences with its presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari on what steps to take on the outcome of the April 21 election, the newspapers reported.
16433	21453	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	But major opposition parties like the ANPP and Action Congress claimed that they do not believe and would not accept the election results.
16434	21454	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The ANPP also said it would support mass action or any form of civil protest by civil society organizations over the conduct of April 14 and 21 poll, which it said, were massively rigged.
16435	21455	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The National Chairman of ANPP Edwin Ume-Ezeoke made the party's official position known at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday.
16436	21456	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	Buhari and the party leadership met for many hours at the party secretariat in Abuja, where they reached a consensus on the matter.
16437	21458	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	The Vice-Chairman of the Media Committee of the ANPP Presidential Campaign Osita Okechukwu said the party would not recognize Yar' Adua's government, adding they "call for the total cancellation of the presidential election while requesting for a fresh election immediately."
16438	21459	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	He said the party would initiate moves through its elected representatives in the National Assembly to sponsor a bill that would reform the INEC so as to remove it from government's interference.

16444	21472	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new "Transformers" movie boasts a good cast, but it's got nothing on the original.
16445	21473	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In a classic bit of movie trivia, the little-seen 1986 animated film "Transformers: The Movie" was Orson Welles' last film.
16446	21474	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Yes, that Orson Welles.
16447	21475	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The filmmaking legend who remade cinema with "Citizen Kane" (which just again topped AFI's list of 100 greatest movies), directed "Touch of Evil," starred in "The Third Man," impeccably adapted Shakespeare to the screen and panicked the nation with his infamous radio broadcast of "War of the Worlds" -- concluded his career by playing Unicron, an evil shape-shifting planet moon.
16448	21476	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was 70 at the time and in poor health.
16449	21477	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His last released film was 1987's "Someone to Love," but that was shot before Welles lent his voice to "Transformers."
16450	21478	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Late in his career, Welles often took to commercials and narration work as a source of income.
16451	21480	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	She recalls Welles telling her shortly before he died that he had spent the day "playing a toy."
16452	21481	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"That was for him a way of earning a living and a way of trying to finance the films that he wanted to make," says Leaming.
16453	21482	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Obviously in those years, there's a tremendous sadness except that the thing he used to always say to me was, `The one thing that's helped me to survive is that I'm not bitter.'"
16454	21483	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Having built his reputation in theater and radio, Welles' immediate, astounding success as a 25-year-old filmmaker with "Citizen Kane" (1941) is Hollywood legend.
16455	21484	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Though he went on to create a number of masterpieces (among them "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Othello"), he is often viewed as failing to recapture his early brilliance.
16456	21485	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In his later decades, Welles had great difficulty gaining financing for his film projects.
16457	21486	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Leaming says he used to refer to parts like "Transformers" as "a job of work," but says he was nevertheless full of ideas and spoke passionately of plans for various movies even on his deathbed.
16458	21487	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He died of a heart attack in October 1985.
16459	21488	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He was absolutely the same man who made `Citizen Kane,'" says Leaming of the aged Welles.
16460	21489	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His voice work in "Transformers: The Movie" was so weak that it was altered with synthesizers until it hardly sounded like him.
16461	21491	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He came in ... and said, `I'm playing an entire planet!'"
16462	21492	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Dille recalled on a DVD of the film released last year.
16463	21493	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The part is in some ways typical of the characters to which Welles was drawn.
16464	21495	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was not the only famous talent to lend his voice to "Transformers: The Movie."
16465	21496	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He was joined by Eric Idle ("Monty Python"), Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek"), Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club") and Robert Stack ("Unsolved Mysteries").
16466	21497	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In this way, "Transformers: The Movie" presaged a contemporary commonplace: cartoons voiced by stars.
16467	21498	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Today, an animated film wouldn't dream of not casting well-known performers.
16468	21499	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"It was groundbreaking to introduce these famous actors in an animated feature," "Transformers: The Movie" producer Joe Bacal says on the DVD.
16469	21500	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Back in 1986, though, it wasn't the payday it is now.
16470	21501	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Transformers: The Movie" yielded less than $6 million at the box office.
16471	21502	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new live-action "Transformers," which opens in theaters July 3, hopes to reap that in a matter of hours.
16472	21503	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The path of "Transformers" reflects the changed nature of Hollywood.
16473	21504	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	What began as a toy for children in the early '80s, has now become an enormous, global Goliath of pop-culture product, meant as much for adults as kids.
16474	21505	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	It's a destiny for "Transformers" that few could have imagined in 1986, even Welles himself.
16475	21506	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Indeed, "Transformers: The Movie" is set in the distant future: the year 2005.

16518	21561	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The city assembly adopted legislation providing for the construction of a mixed-use complex anchored by a glass-encased tower that is to rise 320 meters (1,050 feet), more than twice as high as the stately city's current tallest building.
16519	21562	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The Okhta project, pushed by the state-controlled natural gas monopoly OAO Gazprom, has sparked heated debate.
16520	21564	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Critics say the building would be a massively discordant element on the mostly low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg.
16521	21565	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	They cite rules dating back centuries that have limited the height of buildings in the center of city founded by Czar Peter the Great more than 300 years ago.
16522	21566	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Proponents argue that the site is not in the historical center.
16523	21567	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The law approved by the predominantly pro-Kremlin city legislature sought to appease opponents by decreasing the amount the city will pay to about 25 billion rubles (US$1 billion
16524	21568	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro700 million) instead of the entire projected construction cost of 60 billion rubles (US$2.4 billion
16525	21569	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro1.7 billion), as previously planned.
16526	21570	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Gazprom's oil subsidiary, OAO Gazpromneft, will pay most of the rest, officials said.
16527	21572	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	He expressed hope that lawmakers would bring the height of the tower to 100 meters (328 feet) or less.
16528	21574	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	"Okhta ... will be located not in the city's historical center but at least 500 meters (550 yards) from it," Yagya said.

16532	21582	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	The Compact is aimed at harnessing globalisation by getting the private sector to voluntarily improve social and environmental practices.
16533	21586	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,000 companies have now signed up to the Compact's ten principles covering employment standards, human rights, anti- corruption measures and the environment, according to the United Nations.
16534	21587	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	Officials argue that most of the companies on board no longer simply pay lip service to the partnership.
16535	21589	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	However, human rights and development campaigners are still sharply critical of the Compact.
16536	21590	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	The UN's first ever survey on the Compact published this week also revealed major shortcomings in a sample of about 400 participants, especially in two key fields -- human rights and anti-corruption -- despite overall progress.
16537	21591	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	At least one of the companies with participants registered for the meeting, electric engineering giant Siemens, is embroiled in corruption investigations in Germany, including on suspicion of setting up a slush-fund to obtain foreign contracts.
16538	21592	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	The British- based group Action Aid said the Global Compact had failed to stop corporate human rights violations.
16539	21594	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	"It has been a mockery because several companies violating human rights have been free to join and remain in the Global Compact -- benefiting from an association with the UN," Khan added in a statement.
16540	21596	AFP_ENG_20070704.0639.LDC2009T13	Kell said the United Nations delisted 600 companies last year for the first time and another 500 could be removed this year because of shortcomings in their reporting on implementation of the Compact's principles.

16553	21610	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	He is one of the 832 people who will undertake the relay in June inside the province.

16556	21613	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	Talking about the sabotage activities targeting the relay from Tibetan separatists and other protesters about human rights in China in some countries, Yungzhung Puncog said "they were just making a show of themselves in disturbing the torch relay".
16557	21614	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	"The Olympic Games are a grand event for the people of the whole world and a symbol of peace.
16558	21615	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	To sabotage the Olympic torch relay is to sabotage the peace."
16559	21616	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	The teacher said he believed the government would take powerful measures to ensure the smooth relay in China.
16560	21617	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	But in case an incident did occur, he said he would do everything he could to protect the torch.

16564	21622	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Massey Energy Co.'s chief executive threatened to shoot an ABC News producer and tore his shirt collar when the newsman made an unannounced attempt to interview him in the coal company's parking lot, a network spokesman said Thursday.
16565	21623	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	But CEO Don Blankenship said the scuffle happened after the producer put a camera too close to his face.
16566	21625	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	The two were photographed vacationing in Monaco in July 2006 while Massey had cases pending before the court.
16567	21627	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship then moved quickly toward the producer, grabbed his camera and snapped off a microphone before putting his hand's to the man's throat and tearing his shirt collar, Schneider said.
16568	21628	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship offered a different version of events, saying the producer followed his Cadillac into the parking lot, got out, trained a camera on him and put it too close to his face.
16569	21629	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	"I reached up and moved the camera aside a little bit and he took great offense," he said.
16570	21630	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said the producer grabbed his arm and he grabbed the producer's chest to keep his balance.
16571	21631	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said he moved the producer toward his car and repeatedly asked him to leave.
16572	21632	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said he does not remember saying the producer might be shot, though he does not dispute that comment.
16573	21633	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Schneider said the producer attempted the interview in the parking lot of Blankenship's office in eastern Kentucky after unsuccessful attempts to arrange a face to face meeting.
16574	21634	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said ABC also interviewed Maynard and expects to run the story next week.

16591	21657	APW_ENG_20070426.1787.LDC2009T13	Liddell said Vista beat internal forecasts by $300 million (euro220.65 million) to $400 million (euro294.2 million), and Office 2007 sales were $200 million (euro147.1 million) better than expected.
16592	21659	APW_ENG_20070426.1787.LDC2009T13	"They might indicate Vista is doing fine."

16606	21675	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The terrorist network Al-Qaida will likely leverage its contacts and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S. soil, according to a new National Intelligence Estimate on threats to the United States.
16607	21676	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The declassified key findings, to be released publicly on Tuesday, were obtained in advance by The Associated Press.
16608	21678	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	As expected, however, the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
16609	21679	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The report makes clear that al-Qaida in Iraq, which has not yet posed a direct threat to U.S. soil, could become a problem here.
16610	21682	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments of the 16 spy agencies across the breadth of the U.S. government.
16611	21683	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	These agencies reflect the consensus long- term thinking of top intelligence analysts.
16612	21684	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Portions of the documents are occasionally declassified for public release.
16613	21686	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It also provided new details on their thinking and concerns.
16614	21687	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	For instance, the report says that worldwide counterterrorism efforts since 2001 have constrained al-Qaida's ability to attack the U.S. again and convinced terror groups that U.S. soil is a tougher target.
16615	21688	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But, the report quickly adds, analysts are concerned "that this level of international cooperation may wane as 9/11 becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge."
16616	21689	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Among the report's other findings:
16617	21690	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Al-Qaida is likely to continue to focus on high-profile political, economic and infrastructure targets to cause mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, economic aftershocks and fear.
16618	21691	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
16619	21694	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--The group will continue to seek weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological or nuclear material -- and "would not hesitate to use them."
16620	21696	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Non-Muslim terrorist groups probably will attack here in the next several years, although on a smaller scale.
16621	21697	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The judgments do not name any specific groups, but the FBI often warns of violent environmental groups, such as Earth Liberation Front, and others.
16622	21698	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are part of a longer document, which remains classified.
16623	21699	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It was approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
16624	21700	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	In the last week, reports on this document and another threat assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
16625	21702	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But critics say the evolving threat is evidence of a policy gone wrong.

16627	21704	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas, especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is expanding.
16628	21705	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ... points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate," the estimate said.
16629	21706	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"We assess that this internal Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in Europe, however."

16632	21709	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	A roadside bomb exploded on the fringes of the capital's Shiite slum of Sadr City early Wednesday, killing nine and injuring 21, police said.

16660	21755	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	European markets rose strongly Friday as a recovery in the price of oil helped oil stocks, but Wall Street was down after further grim U.S. economic news.
16661	21759	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the Dow Jones index underperformed Europe's indexes, trading 46.28 points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 8,932.98 after further evidence emerged that the U.S. is heading for a deep and protracted recession.
16662	21760	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell more than 6 percent in September to an annual rate of 817,000 units, a near 18-year low, while and the University of Michigan said its U.S. consumer confidence index slumped to 57.5 in October from 70.3 the previous month.
16663	21762	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It's been an erratic week on Wall Street, with the Dow soaring 936 points on Monday, slipping moderately Tuesday, sinking 733 points Wednesday, and then rallying 401 points Thursday.
16664	21763	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The volatility is not providing investors with much relief, but it is a welcome change from last week's seemingly relentless plunge, during which the Dow logged its worst week ever and Wall Street lost about $2.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.
16665	21764	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The long-term key to the health of financial markets is whether the flurry of activity by governments over the last week or so can actually break the logjam in credit markets.
16666	21765	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	There are growing signs the coordinated interest rate reductions announced last week, and massive liquidity boosts by central banks, are beginning to reduce lending rates between banks.
16667	21766	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The interbank lending rate for three-month dollar loans fell for the fifth day running, the first weekly decline in three months.
16668	21767	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It dropped 0.08 percent to 4.42 percent, while the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, fell almost 0.045 percentage points to 5.045 percent.
16669	21768	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rates are falling, the differential between the rate at which banks lend to each other and official central bank lending rates remain high, signalling a strong degree of mistrust still exists.
16670	21769	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. the base central bank rate is 1.5 percent, while in the euro area it stands at 3.75 percent.
16671	21771	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"A serious global recession is 'baked in the cake' and this is bound to mean that there will be further pulses of risk aversion, further traumas for financial sectors and markets and acute pain both for corporate sectors and for individuals," he added.
16672	21772	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rescue packages have helped alleviate the pressures on the banking system, threats in the financial system remain, from credit default swaps -- which insure against defaults on securities -- from the insurance sector and from emerging markets.

16675	21776	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Concerns about the global economic outlook have taken their toll on oil prices in recent days, which fell Thursday to near 14-month lows below US$70 before recovering US$1.92 Friday to US$71.77.
16676	21778	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Both had suffered major drops Thursday when oil prices dropped steeply.
16677	21779	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Despite Friday's rise, oil prices are half what they were just three months ago and that is weighing on countries dependent on oil exports, such as Russia.
16678	21780	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Its indexes continued their losing streak on Friday, with the MICEX dropping 4.3 percent and the RTS down 6.48 percent.

16680	21783	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	For the week, the Nikkei gained 5 percent, much better than the 24 percent it lost last week.

16704	21823	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Air quality has been one of the top concerns for the 10,500 athletes coming to Beijing for the Olympics, with Rogge fanning those worries last year when he said endurance events could be postponed if the pollution was heavy.
16705	21825	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	What they have done is extraordinary," Rogge told reporters.
16706	21826	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	On the same day, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in China told AFP that the pollution could hinder athletes during the Olympics, and that the long-term dangers to the population of the city were serious.
16707	21827	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"There is an air pollution problem in Beijing," Hans Troedsson said.
16708	21828	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"However, we are missing the point by having so much attention on the short-term exposure while the long-term exposure is really ignored -- that is where we have a problem," the Swede said.

16713	21836	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	The Alma tunnel, on the north bank of the River Seine, is a must- see spot for tourists who are drawn to the site where the 36 -year-old Diana crashed shortly after midnight on August 31, 1997.
16714	21838	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	No official events are planned in Paris, but well-wishers have left dozens of bouquets and photo tributes at the foot of a sculpture of a giant golden flame above the tunnel, which has become an ad-hoc shrine since her death.
16715	21839	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	And some wanted to be here near the very hour of the tragedy, which happened at 26 minutes past midnight (2226 GMT) -- to see the spot in the middle of the night, and to take photographs.
16716	21840	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's a coincidence we are here in Paris on the anniversary of her death," said Anna Gould, 34, who came here from Devon with her husband Ken, 42, and their three daughters aged 13, nine and four.
16717	21841	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"But I was eager to see the place and to show it to the girls.
16718	21842	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Diana was really the people's princess, she did a lot of good, the old bunch at the palace just couldn't take it."
16719	21843	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"Diana was a lovely and generous princess, but Prince Charles and his mother the Queen were so nasty to her that she died heart- broken," she said.

16721	21847	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Some paparazzi were taken in by the ploy, but others set out in pursuit of Paul's Mercedes, headed at high speed towards the Champs-Elysees avenue.
16722	21848	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	At 26 minutes past midnight, after running a red light on the Place de la Concorde, the Mercedes went out of control at high speed and crashed into a support pillar in the Alma underpass.

16726	21853	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	There is the nagging question of whether life exists other than on Earth.
16727	21854	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The enduring mystery of who made us -- and why.
16728	21855	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	And then there is this: Why does the foam on a pint of lager quickly disappear but the head on a pint of Guinness linger?
16729	21856	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Answers to questions 1 and 2 are still being sought, but the Great Beer Riddle, at least, may soon be solved.
16730	21858	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The breakthrough will not only settle the vexatious lager vs. stout debate, it will also help the quest to pour a perfect pint every time.
16731	21859	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces.
16732	21860	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	In other words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid.
16733	21861	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension -- and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of the bubbles.
16734	21862	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	As a result of this movement, the bubbles merge and the structure "coarsens," meaning that the foam settles and eventually disappears.
16735	21864	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.

16738	21867	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	Ultra-fit Tiger Woods has got his fellow pros sprinting for the gym as the world number one takes the game into new territory.
16739	21868	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	Professional golfers have never been known as the fittest sportsman in the world, but all that is changing as a direct results of Woods' example.
16740	21869	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	"There's no doubt, I listen to a few of the older pros talk about the differences in the Tour in the past few years," said up-and- coming Irishman Graeme McDowell.
16741	21870	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	"Especially like when we stay in hotels -- in Abu Dhabi a couple of weeks ago you went to the gym at four or five o'clock and there's 20 players in there.
16742	21871	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	"The shape of the Tour has changed, Tiger has raised the bar from a physical level, he's the guy we all look to.
16743	21873	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	"He's beat himself into unbelievable shape and seems to be getting better all the time.
16744	21874	AFP_ENG_20080208.0479.LDC2009T13	I think that has spurred guys into the gym and has us all lifting weights and working harder and running."

16763	21899	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Two minutes into her routine, she looked like she had the title.
16764	21900	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	But she then fell on the first jump of what was to be a three- jump combination.

16769	21905	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Skating last, after Asada had stirred the crowd with her high score, Ando kept her poise and delivered a solid performance that was good enough to maintain her winning margin.
16770	21906	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The 16-year-old Asada, the world junior champion in 2005, tried a triple axel, but was slightly two-footed on her landing.

16775	21912	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The audience roared at her every jump, cheering even more than they did later for Ando.

16790	21929	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European Scientists Seek Cause of Spacecraft Glitch
16791	21930	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the international space station.
16792	21931	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Officials with the European Space Agency said all other systems on the state-of-the-art spacecraft were working well following its launch from the agency's base in South America, and they did not expect the engine problem to keep the transport, named the Jules Verne, from docking with the space station next month.
16793	21932	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning.
16794	21935	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The planned 16-day shuttle mission, the longest so far to the space station, is part of a concerted effort by NASA to finish assembly of the long-delayed space station by September 2010, at which point the three space shuttles will be retired.
16795	21936	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year gap.
16796	21938	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Europeans' Jules Verne, which is carrying 4.6 tons of cargo, is the first of six transport launches the Europeans promised as their contribution to the space station effort.
16797	21939	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The vehicle has taken almost a decade to develop and launch.
16798	21941	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Bonacino said that researchers and engineers were working to fix the problem from mission control in Toulouse, France, and that the problem did not appear to pose any serious threat to the mission.
16799	21942	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Even if it cannot be fixed, he said, the transport will still be able to dock with the space station.
16800	21943	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	That docking cannot take place, however, until the shuttle Endeavour has arrived and departed -- more than two weeks from Tuesday.
16801	21944	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	With that much time to work on the problem, European space agency officials said they expected to be able to fix it.
16802	21945	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	About half of the Jules Verne's payload is propellant for use by rockets that periodically push the space station higher to compensate for the natural decay of its orbit.
16803	21946	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The rest is oxygen, drinking water and dry goods.
16804	21947	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	After spending four months docked to the station, the transport will carry away waste and will burn up in the atmosphere as the transport plunges to Earth over the southern Pacific Ocean.
16805	21949	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Jules Verne is the first automated spacecraft designed to dock with the station in full compliance with the tight safety constraints imposed after the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.
16806	21953	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad smiled at first but appeared increasingly agitated, decrying the "insults" and "unfriendly treatment."
16807	21955	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
16808	21956	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
16809	21957	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"When you come to a place like this it makes you simply ridiculous," Bollinger said.
16810	21958	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
16811	21959	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here."
16812	21960	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully," Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians.
16813	21961	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."
16814	21962	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	During a question-and-answer session, Ahmadinejad appeared tense and unsmiling, in contrast to more relaxed interviews and appearances earlier in the day.
16815	21964	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But then he said he was defending the rights of European scholars, an apparent reference to a small number who have been prosecuted under national laws for denying or minimizing the Holocaust.
16816	21965	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing known as absolute," he said.
16817	21966	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He reiterated his desire to visit ground zero to express sympathy with the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but then appeared to question whether al-Qaida was responsible.
16818	21967	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Why did this happen?
16819	21968	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	What caused it?
16820	21969	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	What conditions led to it?"
16821	21970	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	he said.
16822	21971	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Who truly was involved?
16823	21972	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Who was really involved and put it all together?"
16824	21973	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Asked about executions of homosexuals in Iran, Ahmadinejad said the judiciary system executed violent criminals and high-level drug dealers, comparing them to microbes eliminated through medical treatment.
16825	21974	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Pressed specifically about punishment of homosexuals, he said: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country."
16826	21975	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	With the audience laughing derisively, he continued: "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon.
16827	21976	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	I don't know who's told you that we have this."
16828	21977	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Bollinger was strongly criticized for inviting Ahmadinejad to Columbia, and had promised tough questions in his introduction to Ahmadinejad's talk.
16829	21978	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But the strident and personal nature of his attack on the president of Iran was startling.
16830	21981	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Ahmadinejad's softer tone on Israel in this speech may reflect backlash in his own country.
16831	21982	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's been widespread commentary in Iran, even on the far- right, that Ahmadinejad's position on Israel has hurt the country's diplomatic relations," said Maloney.
16832	21983	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The fact that he was frankly unwilling to go as far as he has in the past suggests there may have been some consequences for him at home."
16833	21985	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He told Fox News Channel that if Bollinger considers Ahmadinejad's visit an educational experience for Columbia students, "I guess it's OK with me."
16834	21987	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	On Capitol Hill, conservatives said Columbia should not have invited Ahmadinejad to speak.
16835	21990	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people jammed two street blocks across from the United Nations to protest Ahmadinejad's visit to New York.
16836	21991	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Organizers claimed a turnout of tens of thousands.
16837	21992	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Police did not immediately have a crowd estimate.
16838	21995	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Protesters also assembled at Columbia.

16969	22145	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The skirmishing is an indication of the rising anxiety on all sides in the remaining few weeks before the presentation of what is widely considered a make-or-break assessment of Bush's war strategy, and one that will come amid rising calls for a drawdown of U.S. forces from Iraq.
16970	22146	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before Congress.
16971	22148	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
16972	22152	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
16973	22153	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``Americans deserve an even-handed assessment of conditions in Iraq.
16974	22156	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
16975	22157	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
16976	22158	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
16977	22159	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
16978	22160	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	But both the White House and Congress have widely described the assessment as coming from Petraeus.
16979	22161	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
16980	22162	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
16981	22165	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
16982	22166	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the two may not be appearing in public.
16983	22167	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	They said they will continue to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from Washington.
16984	22169	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
16985	22170	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
16986	22171	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
16987	22172	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.

16991	22181	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	BEIJING
16992	22184	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Initial reports from state news media on Wednesday stated that one construction worker died, another was injured and two more were trapped in a landslide on Tuesday at a railroad construction site in Badong County, upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.
16993	22185	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But on Friday morning, Xinhua, the official news agency, released a short report saying that rescuers had discovered a passenger bus crushed beneath the rubble.
16994	22186	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	It said "about 30 more people" were believed dead.
16995	22187	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	"Rescuers said there were no signs of life on the bus," Xinhua reported.
16996	22188	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The bus apparently left Shanghai on Monday.
16997	22189	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	There has been no news about the two trapped workers.
16998	22190	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	As yet, it is not certain what caused this particular landslide, but scientists and critics have been warning for years that the reservoir created by the Three Gorges Dam might further destabilize hillsides, causing landslides and possibly even earthquakes.
16999	22191	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Officials countered that the design of the project accounted for such concerns.
17000	22194	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, a vice mayor from the city of Chongqing said the shoreline of the reservoir had collapsed in 91 places as water levels continued to slowly rise.
17001	22195	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	A day after the forum, Xinhua released a short article disclosing the official concerns.
17002	22196	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The article caused an immediate sensation, given that officials had rarely expressed misgivings about the signature project.
17003	22198	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, ran a banner article across the front page beneath the headline: "Dam Impact 'Less Than Predicted.' "
17004	22199	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Landslides had been a problem in the Three Gorges area before construction of the dam.
17005	22200	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Dam officials say they have made improvements in stabilizing the region's geology in recent years and that landslides are not a major problem.
17006	22201	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But peasants in many villages say the number of landslides have increased since the reservoir began filling up.
17007	22202	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Several local officials have said that pressure from the rising water is a factor in many, if not all, the recent landslides.
17008	22203	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Currently, water levels are at about 500 feet.
17009	22204	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Planners intend to raise water levels to 575 feet by 2009.

17011	22207	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday the plan of direct U.S. stake in banks is focused on regulated firms, indicating unregulated firms such as hedge funds won't initially get government aid.
17012	22208	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"We're focused on financial institutions, regulated financial institutions," Paulson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, when asked whether hedge funds might also be eligible.
17013	22209	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"The program right now is for banks and thrifts," he was quoted as saying.
17014	22210	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	Banking strains have hurt broader economic growth, pushing the United States toward a recession.
17015	22211	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"There's been a shock in the credit markets, and that's exacted a toll on the real economy," said Paulson.
17016	22212	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that the U.S. economy faces "a number of tough months" ahead.
17017	22213	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	In a separate interview on Fox Business Network, Paulson insisted the Bush Administration is pursuing the correct course now to end the debacle.
17018	22214	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"We will mitigate the impact on the real economy and we'll get this financial system working again," he said.

17022	22222	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	NEW DELHI
17023	22223	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	There are two routes to the world's highest peak and both are scheduled to be off limits to mountaineers this spring, as Beijing strives to inaugurate the summer Olympic Games free of pro-Tibetan protests.
17024	22224	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	Beijing announced earlier this week that the route to the summit of Mount Everest along the north face of the mountain, in Chinese-controlled Tibet, would be closed.
17025	22228	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	"They are requesting us, the government of Nepal, to be very careful on this side," he said of the Beijing authorities.
17026	22229	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	He went on to say that his ministry had also pressed tour operators to be extra vigilant of teams scheduled to climb the mountain before May 1, allowing only climbers who are known to the operators.
17027	22232	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	China's plans to have the Olympic torch carried into Tibet over Mount Everest have drawn protests from groups that advocate greater autonomy for Tibet, including among monks in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa.
17028	22235	NYT_ENG_20080314.0045.LDC2009T13	The protesters have since begun a hunger strike, vowing to continue until they are released.
17029	22239	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	A judge rejected a request from Telma Ortiz for a restraining order barring media outlets from filming her, arguing Thursday that she is a public figure despite her wishes.
17030	22240	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz, 35, had argued she was not a celebrity and said news organizations have been harassing her and her companion, Enrique Martin Llop.
17031	22241	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	This week she sued about 50 news outlets in a case being heard in the central city of Toledo.
17032	22242	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The media organizations included major TV channels and gossip magazines like Hola!
17033	22243	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But on Thursday Judge Maria Lourdes Perez Padilla said a restraining order would be "legally unviable" because Ortiz and Martin Llop are in the limelight, even if they claim otherwise.
17034	22244	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The judge ordered them to pay undisclosed court costs.
17035	22246	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz said the media have invaded their privacy repeatedly.
17036	22248	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But in this case, Ortiz sought a blanket ban on news organizations publishing photos or footage of her, except ones in which she appears at official functions in her role as sister of the crown princess.
17037	22249	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Such appearances are rare.
17038	22250	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz is the middle sister of three.
17039	22251	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Letizia is the eldest.
17040	22252	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The youngest, Erika, died in February 2007 in what was widely believed to have been a suicide.
