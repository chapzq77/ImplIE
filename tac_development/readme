For testing the implicit relation extractor on 1000 random TAC files.  This takes a two step approach.
First the we extract all of the sentences from the sources and place it in one file in the sentences folder.
Then we run the extractor on the sentence file and store it in a file in the results folder.


The sentence and results file has the same name is prefixed with a sequence number that is stored in the file name "file_sequence_number".
The sentence file is structured so that each line has the sentence sequence number, source file docid, and then the sentence, each separated by a tab.
The results file is structured the same way, but replaces the sentence with the extraction result, which should include the sentence.

get_random_files.sh is used to get the files from the old tac development set.
get_random_lines.sh is used to get random lines from the extraction results to look at.
