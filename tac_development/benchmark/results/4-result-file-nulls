3985	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan was proposed by the top American commanders responsible for Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno, and it represents their first recommendation on troop withdrawals under an Obama presidency.
3996	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"Sixteen months is going to be tough," said one senior military officer who was briefed on the plan.
4011	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan drafted by Odierno and Petraeus was drawn up to meet the so-called status of forces agreement between the United States and Iraqi governments that calls for all American forces to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 and all combat troops out of Iraqi cities by June 2009.
4013	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	One way commanders say they will try to meet that first deadline is by effectively reassigning combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the difference would be in some cases semantic because armed American troops would still go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.
4014	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The participants at the Chicago meeting did discuss the deadline for all American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraqi cities by June, as outlined in the agreement with the Iraqi government.

4017	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	In a briefing to reporters last week in Balad, Iraq, Odierno said that some American forces would remain in a support role in Iraqi cities beyond the June deadline.
4018	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	He said that the troops would be deployed at numerous security outposts in urban areas to help support and train Iraqi forces.
4019	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"We'll maintain our very close partnership with the Iraqi security forces throughout Iraq even after the summer," he said.
4020	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Odierno said that it was particularly important for American troops to support Iraqis in 2009, when three elections, at the provincial, district and national levels, are scheduled.
4022	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Odierno also said that he was planning for all American forces to be out of Iraq by 2011, as called for in the agreement with the Iraqi government, but he said the agreement could be renegotiated.
4024	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The new military plan also calls for American troops in Iraq after 2011, but it does not put a number on that force, a person familiar with its details said.
