697	2581	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.

999	3636	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she created that uses computer play to teach reading.
1000	3637	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for children.
1001	3640	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for kids gaming," Johnson said.

1248	4450	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
1249	4451	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
1250	4453	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.

1253	4457	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
1254	4460	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
1255	4467	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had nudged rates up by a quarter-point.
1256	4468	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Before the Fed started raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more than four decades.
1257	4469	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

1471	5152	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Skating last, after Asada had stirred the crowd with her high score, Ando kept her poise and delivered a solid performance that was good enough to maintain her winning margin.
1472	5154	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	She also underrotated a combination.
1473	5157	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"I was very impressed by myself," Asada said.

1475	5165	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Defending champion Kimmie Meissner of the United States was fourth, scoring 180.23.
1476	5167	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"It was not my best.
1477	5168	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	I can do better," Meissner said.
1478	5171	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	The championships ended with the gold medals spread among four countries.

2229	7375	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a hurricane.
2230	7380	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The main concern for much of the mission was the gouge to Endeavour's protective tiles.
2231	7381	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA did not want the shuttle to suffer any structural damage that, while not catastrophic, might require lengthy postflight repairs.
2232	7382	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Over the past few days and right up until landing, NASA had stressed that the 3 1/2-inch-long 3.5 (8.9-centimeter-long) gouge in Endeavour's belly would not endanger the shuttle during its landing.
2233	7385	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that the spacecraft would hold up.
2234	7388	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station visit short because of Hurricane Dean.
2235	7390	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Even though forecasters later put Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.

2238	7395	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damage triggered a weeklong analyses that involved hundreds of engineers and thousands of hours of supercomputer simulations.
2239	7396	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the problem is solved.

2408	8011	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad smiled at first but appeared increasingly agitated, decrying the "insults" and "unfriendly treatment."
2409	8013	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
2410	8014	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
2411	8016	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
2412	8017	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here."
2413	8019	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."
2414	8020	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	During a question-and-answer session, Ahmadinejad appeared tense and unsmiling, in contrast to more relaxed interviews and appearances earlier in the day.

2420	8031	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Asked about executions of homosexuals in Iran, Ahmadinejad said the judiciary system executed violent criminals and high-level drug dealers, comparing them to microbes eliminated through medical treatment.
2421	8032	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Pressed specifically about punishment of homosexuals, he said: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country."
2422	8033	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	With the audience laughing derisively, he continued: "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon.
2423	8036	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But the strident and personal nature of his attack on the president of Iran was startling.

2489	8318	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	The crackdown is a signal to many in Nigeria that Yar'Adua is trying to make good on his pledge to stamp out graft in a country that is considered one of the most corrupt in the world.
2490	8321	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Ribadu's agency was set up in 2004 as part of an anti-corruption drive by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo.

2493	8335	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Ethics questions and corruption allegations also have swirled around Kerik.
2494	8336	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president," Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly vetted his associate of nearly two decades.

2737	9221	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.

2741	9233	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Yes, she is a living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his feature debut.
2742	9234	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge tale.
2743	9235	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross- out factor he'd established early on.

2799	9423	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
2800	9424	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
2801	9432	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.

2803	9435	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
2804	9438	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
2805	9442	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Unlike cooking, where chefs proudly show off new techniques made possible through innovation, winemaking's become more secretive, said Smith.
2806	9443	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"It's a shame," he said, "because winemaking's just cooking."
2807	9445	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
2808	9446	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
2809	9447	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
2810	9448	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the grower," he said.
2811	9450	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"We like our wines.

2919	9863	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
2920	9866	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on the beef recall Tuesday.

2923	9877	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
2924	9883	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.
2925	9884	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said.

3233	10610	APW_ENG_20080427.0817.LDC2009T13	Fleury helped the Penguins kill off two key Rangers power plays in the final six-plus minutes and Adam Hall scored into an empty net with 16.7 seconds remaining.
3234	10617	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Patterson, a former diplomat from Costa Rica, claims to have proper ownership of the artifacts, investigators said.

3237	10623	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	He could face criminal charges if it is determined that he is not the collection's rightful owner, Waldinger said.
3238	10625	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Report: Deutsche Telekom CEO asks for patience from shareholders
3239	10626	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2008-05-11 13:03:15 UTC
3240	10628	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Rene Obermann took over as head of Europe's biggest telecom company in late 2006.
3241	10629	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Last week, the company reported a rise in first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.
3242	10631	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"I want to show shareholders what great potential our company has
3243	10632	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	and I want to make clear how great an effort we are making to increase the value of the company," Obermann was quoted as telling the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
3244	10637	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann said that his company's marketing of Apple's iPhone in Germany, where it is available only with a two-year contract from Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit, has been "attractive and profitable."
3245	10638	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	He was quoted as saying that it has sold more than 100,000 of the devices in Germany so far.
3246	10641	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"That would be irresponsible."
3247	10646	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Ortiz, 35, had argued she was not a celebrity and said news organizations have been harassing her and her companion, Enrique Martin Llop.
3248	10648	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The media organizations included major TV channels and gossip magazines like Hola!
3249	10649	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But on Thursday Judge Maria Lourdes Perez Padilla said a restraining order would be "legally unviable" because Ortiz and Martin Llop are in the limelight, even if they claim otherwise.
3250	10650	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The judge ordered them to pay undisclosed court costs.
3251	10654	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But in this case, Ortiz sought a blanket ban on news organizations publishing photos or footage of her, except ones in which she appears at official functions in her role as sister of the crown princess.
3252	10655	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Such appearances are rare.
3253	10657	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Letizia is the eldest.
3254	10661	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	India and Pakistan will hold peace talks Tuesday for the first time since Islamabad shifted from military rule, but the instability of the new civilian government could prove a hurdle to even modest progress, analysts said.
3255	10663	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	India has accused Pakistan-based Islamic militants of involvement in past attacks.
3256	10668	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A breakthrough in the slow-moving dialogue appears unlikely -- not least because of a falling out within the coalition over how to restore judges fired last year by the former military strongman.
3257	10669	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	That dispute has raised doubts over the government's survival.
3258	10672	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	The negotiations between Pakistan and India are aimed at ultimately resolving their conflict over the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
3259	10673	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	So far the talks have diminished the possibility of war, and fostered cultural and transportation links, but achieved little else.
3260	10675	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	First top civil servants will hold talks, then the two foreign ministers.
3261	10692	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"I don't think they necessarily want to build up tension," he said.
3262	10704	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Gaza militants launch rockets and mortars into Israel almost daily.
3263	10707	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Israel holds the Hamas militant group, which violently seized control of Gaza last June, responsible for all violence emanating from the area.
3264	10709	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, Hamas said one of its members was killed on a "holy mission."
3265	10710	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The term is used when a Hamas militant dies, either when mishandling explosives or in a premature explosion intended for an attack against Israel.

3267	10717	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	"There is no simple metric or calculation that can give us a green or red light on further reductions," wrote Odierno in a lengthy question-and-answer document submitted to the panel in advance of a hearing scheduled Thursday before the Senate.
3268	10718	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Various factors will be considered, but "I will rely most heavily on my subordinate commanders' recommendations and my own independent judgment," he added.
3269	10720	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Last year, both generals were integral to crafting and implementing Bush's new military strategy in Iraq, which included the deployment of 30,000 additional troops.
3270	10721	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has recommended, and Bush has agreed, to withdraw the extra troops by July but to halt further reductions after that.
3271	10722	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has said he needs a 45-day period of evaluation and then an indefinite period of assessment before he could recommend further pullouts.

3283	10779	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
3284	10783	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.

3286	10785	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing."
3287	10790	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.

3314	10895	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the law, then sent relieved drivers on their way.

3911	12928	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Look, I'm a junior member,'' young McHenry protested.
3912	12931	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not whining,'' he whined.
3913	12932	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the Democrats' heavy-handed leadership.

3915	12938	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``That is exactly what we're talking about,'' Emanuel said, trying to appease the protesters.
3916	12944	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	If Wednesday was any indication, the 110th Congress will be highly entertaining, if not terribly productive.
3917	12948	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was covered with a layer of makeup.
3918	12951	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
3919	12954	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``So is there a little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority rights?''
3920	12955	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
3921	12956	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were still in the majority?''
3922	12960	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	As soon as the Putnam session ended, Granger took the elevator up three flights and joined McHenry and his cohort in the TV gallery.
3923	12962	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``It's very disappointing,'' she said.
3924	12963	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights.
3925	12968	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Fortunately for McHenry, the Democrats were otherwise engaged.
3926	12969	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	An hour after fleeing the microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about ethics and the minimum wage.

3928	12973	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.

3931	12978	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But for the winners, the winners!
3932	12980	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The musical ``Dreamgirls'' led the day with eight nominations, followed by the ensemble film ``Babel'' with seven.
3933	12983	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding hands when their film's nominations were announced.
3934	12986	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It started off with me pretending to sleep last night,'' he continued.
3935	12987	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
3936	12989	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I sat up and I just hugged her and we cried for like five minutes.
3937	12990	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
3938	13005	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``We've never been through something like this together, but it's better than going through it alone.''
3939	13012	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.

3943	13019	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I don't think anyone is more shocked than me,'' Gosling said Tuesday, noting that ``Half Nelson'' was a smaller film ``we didn't even expect to get distribution.''

3953	13055	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
3954	13058	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.

3956	13061	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
3957	13065	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.

3960	13077	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
3961	13078	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer does not offer health coverage.
3962	13080	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
3963	13082	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
3964	13083	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy Childers can better afford insurance?''
3965	13086	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Currently, employers can deduct health- care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot.
3966	13087	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses.
3967	13088	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher.

3969	13092	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns.

3973	13109	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.

3978	13120	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
3979	13124	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
3980	13125	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
3981	13127	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week.
3982	13136	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
3983	13137	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''

3990	13169	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not years, before that announcement.
3991	13171	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.

3993	13176	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Well, The Washington Post's Web site screwed up the John Edwards story, too.
3994	13178	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety.
3995	13179	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at 12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House Bid.''
3996	13180	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
3997	13182	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
3998	13185	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move quickly once the candidate announced his plans.

4000	13187	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said.
4001	13192	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl DC.
4002	13193	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said.
4003	13194	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``We should have been up front.''
4004	13195	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Fishbowl DC posted a screen shot of the erroneous washingtonpost.com headline Friday morning.
4005	13196	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said his staff is investigating possible defects in their publishing tools to prevent a recurrence.

4011	13209	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Take this true- false test.
4012	13210	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	1.
4013	13213	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Cervical cancer is primarily a concern for older women.
4014	13215	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	If a man uses a condom, neither partner will acquire HPV.
4015	13217	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The chances of getting HPV are slim.
4016	13229	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The vaccine is not effective if a female is already sexually active.
4017	13232	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	ANSWERS
4018	13240	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Although the median age for cervical cancer diagnosis is 48, it has been detected in females as young as 17.
4019	13243	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
4020	13245	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The virus is transmitted skin to skin, not through bodily fluids.
4021	13248	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
4022	13249	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	At least half of sexually active people will acquire genital HPV virus in their lifetime.
4023	13250	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	By age 50, at least 80 percent of females will have been infected.
4024	13253	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	True, at least for now.
4025	13255	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	And a DNA test for HPV is also available.
4026	13257	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	True, although a male vaccine is in development.
4027	13260	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Herpes (HSV) differs from HPV
4028	13261	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	it does not cause the same symptoms or pose the same health problems.
4029	13263	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
4030	13264	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of cervical cancers can be prevented by the vaccine.
4031	13266	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
4032	13267	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The vaccine has been found to be about 90 percent effective in preventing genital warts and may provide some protection against precancers of the vulva, vagina and cervix.
4033	13269	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
4034	13273	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	There is no evidence that vaccination has any effect on behavior.
4035	13276	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	You're well informed on this topic.
4036	13279	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Fewer than five right: Start reading.
4037	13285	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed.
4038	13288	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Officials in Iraq and Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
4039	13291	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back.
4040	13292	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government
4041	13293	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	a 3-month-old security plan has made few inroads against withering violence
4042	13298	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said.
4043	13301	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
4044	13302	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
4045	13303	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
4046	13305	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
4047	13306	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
4048	13307	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
4049	13308	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
4050	13311	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We as a political movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
4051	13314	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for the first time in more than four months.
4052	13315	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
4053	13316	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
4054	13317	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice.
4055	13318	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to Israel.
4056	13320	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to the devils.''
4057	13321	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his traditional black robes and turban.

4062	13341	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	``At first glance, the results of the study were a surprise,'' says Candace Corlett of WSL Strategic Retail, which released the report, titled ``The Pulse, How America Shops Everyday.''
4063	13342	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	``But the truth is that this demographic grew up in a world that was much less disposable.
4064	13344	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	They didn't buy and toss things.
4065	13350	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	Greenoptions.com, a Web site offering news and networking to consumers interested in lowering their ``environmental impact'' while maintaining a comfortable lifestyle, recently launched ``Greening the Golden Years,'' a series of podcasts hosted by retired radio journalist Max Lindberg.
4066	13354	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	``It makes sense that seniors are on the leading edge of this movement,'' says Lindberg, 76, whose interest in environmental issues was sparked some years ago by the alternative fuel movement.
4067	13355	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	``We've been watching the environment die away.

4071	13366	LTW_ENG_20070626.0067.LDC2009T13	When buying new appliances, choose energy efficient models -- look for the ``Energy Star'' seal.
4072	13373	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	The ruling Justice and Development Party, known in Turkey as the AKP, won a thumping 47 percent of the vote in the parliamentary contest.
4073	13383	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Losing My Jihadism
4074	13387	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
4075	13388	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
4076	13392	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
4077	13394	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
4078	13395	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
4079	13399	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I prayed to God to give me the strength to overcome them.
4080	13401	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
4081	13402	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
4082	13404	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
4083	13406	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
4084	13409	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
4085	13411	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
4086	13414	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
4087	13419	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically if our religion is to survive and thrive.
4088	13420	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
4089	13425	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
4090	13429	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
4091	13430	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
4092	13432	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
4093	13434	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
4094	13435	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
4095	13438	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
4096	13440	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt that He was moving me toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we pray to God from the heart.
4097	13441	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
4098	13444	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
4099	13445	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
4100	13446	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
4101	13450	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of the verse of light.
4102	13451	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15, I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time.
4103	13452	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
4104	13453	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
4105	13455	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
4106	13456	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
4107	13459	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
4108	13461	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
4109	13462	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	he shared it only with a small, trusted circle of students.
4110	13464	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.
4111	13469	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
4112	13473	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
4113	13475	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But well drillers today are often uneasy with the practice.
4114	13480	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
4115	13481	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Others, in the name of rational skepticism, just call it bunk.
4116	13482	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
4117	13483	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
4118	13484	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
4119	13490	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
4120	13492	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
4121	13494	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting groundwater wherever one digs.
4122	13495	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Dowsers and their supporters say that misses the point.
4123	13497	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He said dowsers found him plentiful supplies on three properties.
4124	13500	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Lore has it that the term ``water witch'' derives not from a description of a person but rather from the witch hazel branches preferred by Anglo-Scottish immigrants.
4125	13502	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But they agree on the need for a clear mind and sharp focus.
4126	13505	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the carpenter does.
4127	13506	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The rod doesn't find water
4128	13508	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain.
4129	13512	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``Relax.
4130	13515	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his knack with rods, an enigma.
4131	13521	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
4132	13522	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
4133	13524	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
4134	13525	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
4135	13526	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
4136	13529	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
4137	13532	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
4138	13535	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
4139	13539	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
4140	13542	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
4141	13543	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
4142	13549	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
4143	13550	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Hope that helps.
4144	13551	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a problem with clover.
4145	13552	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
4146	13554	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
4147	13555	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I tend to have a lot of clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
4148	13564	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.
4149	13581	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
4150	13582	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
4151	13585	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	But both the White House and Congress have widely described the assessment as coming from Petraeus.
4152	13587	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
4153	13595	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
4154	13596	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
4155	13600	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few weeks.

4157	13607	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
4158	13608	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
4159	13612	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
4160	13613	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
4161	13617	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
4162	13626	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.
4163	13635	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That's what the market is trying to find out."
4164	13639	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	`Religious Enlightenment' Part of Detainee Reeducation Effort
4165	13641	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said such efforts, aimed mainly at Iraqis who have been held for more than a year, are intended to "bend them back to our will" and are part of waging war in what he called "the battlefield of the mind."
4166	13643	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense bloggers.
4167	13647	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
4168	13648	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and interrogators help distinguish the extremists from others, he said.
4169	13649	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some detainees are recommended for release.
4170	13660	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said that six additional young people had been sent to him just Tuesday, and that "the trend is towards the youth," including 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds.
4171	13662	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said that youths grow up to become insurgents by starting out as messengers, guards and even planters of makeshift bombs.
4172	13664	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone, who speaks Arabic and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have 30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors.
4173	13665	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also started "four very large soccer programs" aimed at young detainees.
4174	13670	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We were trying to figure out if they're messing with us.
4175	13671	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... You're not talking about radicals going to choirboys."
4176	13674	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone described a sort of religious insurgency that occurred at one detention facility on Sept. 2.
4177	13678	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... I mean, that is historic."
4178	13681	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other elements of Stone's program are being developed.
4179	13683	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also begun a "huge, expensive" Rand Corp. research study on detainee motivation and morale and has plans for a major communication campaign.
4180	13684	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he also wants to provide jobs for released detainees.
4181	13685	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not naive," Stone said.
4182	13690	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew.
4183	13700	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the Turner house, that leaves an exhausted wife with chipped nail polish to hold up the family's collapsing world.
4184	13703	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
4185	13705	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
4186	13708	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
4187	13709	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
4188	13718	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	There is a VFW tavern in town, but Troy doesn't bother.
4189	13719	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After one of his distraught soldier buddies from Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy stays away from alcohol.
4190	13723	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The meds give him tremors.
4191	13724	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He used to cut the grass and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a perpetual patient.
4192	13726	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?"

4194	13735	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
4195	13739	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Bible rests on the back seat.
4196	13740	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two- lane highway.
4197	13742	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Finally Troy says he thinks his new medication is making him less aggressive.
4198	13747	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
4199	13750	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
4200	13756	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
4201	13757	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
4202	13758	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
4203	13761	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
4204	13762	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
4205	13768	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	That meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army.
4206	13769	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 13 months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was reimbursed.
4207	13778	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle tells him what day it is.
4208	13781	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A former Marine with ramrod posture, the vet has PTSD and an encyclopedic knowledge of VA procedures.
4209	13782	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
4210	13783	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Huntington (a VA regional office) says you are his fiduciary, right?"
4211	13784	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle says.
4212	13786	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't let these people get over on you!"
4213	13788	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
4214	13791	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
4215	13792	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
4216	13796	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.
4217	13800	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
4218	13801	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle's voice breaks.
4219	13806	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
4220	13807	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He tells Michelle how hard he tried, and she smiles and touches his arm.
4221	13809	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately the doctor is on leave for the next month.
4222	13810	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The first available slot is five weeks out, at 8:30 a.m.
4223	13811	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
4224	13812	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
4225	13815	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
4226	13818	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977.
4227	13820	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
4228	13821	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
4229	13824	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In a sign of the deepening financial crisis faced by many back from war, Operation Homefront has provided $2 million in bailout funds to 4,300 families so far in 2007, double last year's caseload.
4230	13827	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The $860 VA disability check barely covers expenses.

4232	13831	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
4233	13832	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.

4240	13862	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle calls out to Troy.
4241	13868	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	According to VA, he doesn't meet the criteria for 100 percent because his impairment is not "persistent," with "persistent delusions" or a "persistent danger of hurting himself or others."
4242	13871	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
4243	13872	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She has a year to appeal the rating.
4244	13873	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
4245	13874	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
4246	13875	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
4247	13876	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.
4248	13877	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
4249	13879	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
4250	13882	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
4251	13883	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
4252	13884	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
4253	13885	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy returns to his recliner.
4254	13888	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
4255	13891	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, there are moments of gallows humor.
4256	13892	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
4257	13897	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
4258	13898	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he says.
4259	13900	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's still an injury."

4265	13916	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the medical establishment warn parents?
4266	13917	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
4267	13918	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
4268	13921	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
4269	13931	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
4270	13936	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were made for children and the products never again received any kind of detailed scrutiny.
4271	13939	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a similar conclusion in 2004.
4272	13940	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.

4279	13963	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.

4324	14094	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
4325	14096	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Then a big tote is essential.
4326	14097	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If not, a smaller bag might be right for you.
4327	14098	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	The gargantuan bag (a la Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you need a big bag I say go for it.
4328	14100	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it -- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for my back, even when empty.

4334	14119	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
4335	14122	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.
4336	14125	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If you choose gold, make sure it's nothing too sparkly-bright.
4337	14127	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
4338	14130	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
4339	14134	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital) last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.
4340	14145	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
4341	14146	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
4342	14147	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
4343	14148	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.

4351	14191	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	One by one, the items were thrown into the fire licking out of a 4-by-4-foot wheeled container, charred from years of use.

4367	14231	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the U.S., as is the pool of qualified artisans, she said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.

4373	14248	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
4374	14249	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
4375	14251	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
4376	14253	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
4377	14258	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
4378	14259	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
4379	14260	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
4380	14261	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the only ones investors are buying these days, which is why policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
4381	14262	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
4382	14263	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
4383	14265	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	A lot of the details have not yet been determined.
4384	14267	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
4385	14276	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."

4387	14280	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
4388	14283	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
4389	14284	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
4390	14285	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
4391	14286	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
4392	14288	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The perceived risk is not a creditworthiness issue, Rajadhyaksha said.
4393	14290	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
4394	14291	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
4395	14293	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."

4404	14320	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the international space station.
4405	14322	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning.
4406	14326	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year gap.

4412	14346	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In street conversations, Internet discussions and academic forums, most Chinese have readily embraced the government's contention that the violence resulted from a plot mounted by the Dalai Lama from his exile headquarters in India.
4413	14347	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Against that background, the Communist Party has met with broad popular approval in vowing to crack down on the rioters -- most of whose victims were Han Chinese -- and in qualifying the "impudent" Dalai Lama as a "master terror maker" who has hoodwinked the West with his appeals for peace.

4421	14376	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	So for Beijing officials and the public they have educated through propaganda, the Dalai Lama is less a devout Buddhist than a secessionist rebel.

4463	14483	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives to keep former wheat acres in corn.
4464	14484	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Within a year, David Braaten, a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others near completion.
4465	14485	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.
4466	14493	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements, requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year.
4467	14494	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
4468	14496	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
4469	14500	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
4470	14503	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.

4482	14521	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, it seems, we're getting hit from all directions.
4483	14522	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Energy and food prices are soaring.
4484	14523	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to collapse.
4485	14524	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Government revenue is falling, and taxes are rising.
4486	14528	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Even investment bankers are losing their jobs.
4487	14529	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The tendency is to see these as separate developments, each with its own causes and dynamic.
4488	14531	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.
4489	14533	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
4490	14536	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Unlike housing, which began losing steam two years ago, these other sectors have just begun the painful process of repricing and finding a new balance between supply and demand.
4491	14541	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
4492	14544	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
4493	14547	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem.
4494	14548	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
4495	14552	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	and treating passengers fairly when flights are canceled.
4496	14553	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But they also include costs that may be less obvious, like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs, paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
4497	14554	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
4498	14555	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
4499	14559	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And you can add a third blow, this one from government.
4500	14560	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Across the country, state and local governments are already hip- deep into budget crises in response to declining revenue from property assessments and real estate transfers.
4501	14569	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But it does represent the end of a decade or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world -- and by their own leaders -- to live way beyond their means.

4535	14660	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed concert.
4536	14664	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Three decades later, it's all changed.
4537	14665	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage thing in the '70s.
4538	14666	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll concert.
4539	14669	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I've been there, from the smoke-filled general admission arenas where armband-wearing employees led the too-stoned to a backroom cot, to today's reserved seating shows where one flash of a digital camera gets you scolded by security.
4540	14671	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From Bic lighter encores to open cell-phone salutes.
4541	14672	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
4542	14673	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It's all been part of a living museum.
4543	14676	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	If I could collect them like paintings, I would.
4544	14677	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The closest I come to collecting is buying tickets
4545	14678	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands I saw 30 years ago.
4546	14684	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller closed his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other."
4547	14687	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Time is no longer on their side.
4548	14688	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Each tour now may be that band's last.
4549	14689	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly done, approaching historical status.
4550	14697	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The clock is ticking, not only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
4551	14698	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So we buy tickets to beat that clock.
4552	14699	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Our summer lined up with bands that may never tour again.
4553	14700	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
4554	14702	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed.
4555	14705	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love, reached our ears.
4556	14706	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My children heard a Beatle sing.
4557	14708	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will never see Mr. Reed, alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking transformation.
4558	14712	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
4559	14715	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no John Fogerty penning scathing lyrics against the war.
4560	14717	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
4561	14718	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Beatle.
4562	14719	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music.
4563	14721	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert takes another little piece of my heart with the final encore.
4564	14727	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Called visceral fat, it is associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.
4565	14728	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Such patients typically have abnormally low levels of growth hormone and researchers had hoped that replacing it with genetically engineered human growth hormone -- the same drug used to treat below normal growth rates and can be abused by athletes -- might reverse the effects.
4566	14729	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints.
4567	14730	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the hormone.
4568	14734	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The team did not study cardiovascular risk.
4569	14735	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial.
4570	14736	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon said that future clinical trials should include a diabetes drug, such as metformin, to minimize side effects.
4571	14742	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB, and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
4572	14743	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	At the end of six months, 16.3 percent of those who received nevirapine when they were already taking rifampicin for TB had treatment failure marked by high levels of HIV in their blood, compared to 8.3 percent of those who did not have TB.
4573	14744	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting.
4574	14745	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.
4575	14746	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The researchers do not know why the drug interferes with HIV treatment.
4576	14751	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant.
4577	14752	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
4578	14753	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.
4579	14756	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular administration.
4580	14757	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
4581	14759	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Co., Inc., had been bought out.
4582	14768	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector.
4583	14771	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."
4584	14772	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
4585	14773	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
4586	14774	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
4587	14775	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
4588	14779	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.
4589	14781	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine.
4590	14782	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Would you?"
4591	14787	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court also will decide whether officials can be held liable for violations of rights that took place on their watch.
4592	14791	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They are expected on Tuesday to announce they will hear a handful of those cases.
4593	14793	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	First up is a case that tests whether the makers of "light" and "low tar" cigarettes can be sued for allegedly seeking to fool smokers into thinking these cigarettes are safer.
4594	14795	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On the major issues, such abortion, race, religion, the death penalty, gun rights, gay rights and presidential power, the justices have been sharply divided.
4595	14797	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The retirement of a single justice could tip the balance to the right or the left.
4596	14799	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	A second of the liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is 75, and could be replaced by the next president, particularly if the newly elected chief executive serves eight years in the White House.
4597	14800	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	So far, the court does not have before it a hot-button case on abortion, race or religion, although that could change after new cases are added in coming weeks.
4598	14803	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Not surprisingly, this approach has won the backing of manufacturers.
4599	14806	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Sat, 27 Sep 2008 14:00:38 -0400 Message-Id: E_M_A_I_L From: E_M_A_I_L To: latwp@ldc.upenn.edu Subject: LATWP 092708: bc-russia-sevastopol Date: Sat, 27 Sep 2008 14:00:30 -0400 Content-Type: text/plain

4602	14833	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They support the separatists."
4603	14838	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	There have been reports that Russia has quietly begun to grant passports to some residents
4604	14852	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"It's only the language of state business," one bookseller said with a shrug.
4605	14854	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, has other ideas.
4606	14858	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The fleet will be renovated.
4607	14859	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	... New ships will be arriving here."
4608	14863	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"The West shuddered 150 years ago when Russia showed its sword, and the Black Sea turned red with blood," said Igor Bebin, a pink-robed priest who rose to his feet, vodka glass held high.
4609	14867	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The Russians cheered, and took a deep drink.
4610	14871	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the United States.
4611	14879	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have serious differences with on fundamental questions."
4612	14882	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I wouldn't be running."
4613	14885	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
4614	14889	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"They can run misleading ads.
4615	14890	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They can pursue the politics of anything goes.
4616	14891	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It will not work.
4617	14892	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Not this time," Obama said.
4618	14893	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
4619	14896	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on Obama's character.
4620	14901	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad, in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks, intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business."
4621	14903	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... They even endorsed him for president."
4622	14904	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a lawyer.
4623	14907	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented challenges facing their families and our nation."
4624	14908	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
4625	14910	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter registration forms that they collect.
4626	14916	LTW_ENG_20081020.0053.LDC2009T13	But he declined to run, citing concerns about his privacy and a lack of passion for political combat.
4627	14921	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.
4628	14928	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
4629	14930	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.

4631	14932	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
4632	14935	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
4633	14936	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
4634	14937	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The investment in a single patient can easily top $1 million over time.
4635	14941	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
4636	14943	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health, it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue.

4646	14969	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
4647	14970	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
4648	14971	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
4649	14972	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In a settlement last year, the state agreed to restore its policy of providing routine dialysis, but the settlement applies only to Arizona.
4650	14975	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
4651	14980	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.

4806	15413	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance.
4807	15418	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Many in her church had been eager to hear her explain why she signed onto the communique, when she, as much as anyone, is clearly a product of the church's inclusive rainbow culture.
4808	15423	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori concluded by noting that Lent is about to begin, and said that both sides in this conflict are being asked to undergo a "season of fasting
4809	15425	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Conservatives in the church were also wary about the communique's plan, but generally far more upbeat than the liberals.
4810	15428	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
4811	15432	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Some liberals on Tuesday were latching onto what they saw as a loophole because the wording specifies that the bishops will not authorize rites.
4812	15433	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are many bishops who have not formally authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless allow priests to perform them.
4813	15435	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"Blessings happen, sure," said Sisk.
4814	15436	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"But I didn't authorize them."
4815	15438	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The most despairing reactions came from gay men and lesbians in the church, who say this is not reconciliation, but capitulation.
4816	15445	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Requiring fewer fill-ups at the pumps, the vehicles are putting a pinch on the federal Highway Trust Fund -- the major government funding source for highway and mass-transit projects.
4817	15446	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
4818	15447	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	To be fair, federal officials say, it's not just energy-efficient autos that are sucking the fund dry.
4819	15449	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for each gallon of gas.
4820	15451	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"This total dependence on gas tax isn't working anymore."
4821	15455	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
4822	15456	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.

4824	15467	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
4825	15472	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
4826	15476	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
4827	15479	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
4828	15480	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
4829	15481	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
4830	15483	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.

4833	15490	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The overall prevalence was slightly higher than previous estimates.
4834	15495	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
4835	15496	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
4836	15501	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
4837	15502	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
4838	15510	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack in the book market raised questions about the effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in the capital but not the number of car bombings.
4839	15511	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep black smoke billowing above the city.

4843	15527	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were to testify.
4844	15530	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Together, the trio's stories set the emotional tenor for the testimony from military officials that followed.
4845	15531	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi, causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
4846	15532	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient treatment, he recounted.
4847	15534	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He wandered into a building and received directions.
4848	15535	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
4849	15536	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He told of languishing in the hospital's bureaucratic system that evaluates soldiers for continuing in active duty or becoming medically retired, and what benefits they should receive.
4850	15538	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Spc. Jeremy Duncan, one ear shredded by a makeshift bomb, told of the moldy living conditions in Building 18.
4851	15542	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was "extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The Washington Post.
4852	15545	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Most of the soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.
4853	15549	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq."

4856	15554	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Last week, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey was ousted over his handling of the revelations at Walter Reed, and officials changed the hospital's commanding officer twice in as many days.
4857	15556	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.
4858	15557	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we work to improve conditions at Walter Reed, we want to find out whether similar problems have occurred at other military" and Veterans Administration hospitals, he said.
4859	15558	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"These brave men and women deserve the heartfelt thanks of our country, and they deserve the very best medical care that our government can possibly provide."
4860	15560	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
4861	15562	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
4862	15567	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But the subcommittee members continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to civilians had left the hospital depleted.
4863	15568	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.

4890	15620	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	It was one of 40-some drivers he's tested this season.
4891	15622	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Hale Irwin, who had a two-shot lead after Friday's first round, struggled to a 1-under 71 but leads by one shot.
4892	15623	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, who has won 45 tournaments on the Champions Tour, has won 33 of 47 tournaments in which he was leading or sharing the lead heading into the final round.
4893	15624	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	When asked about his success while playing with the lead, Irwin stuck his fingers in his ears and said, "La, la, la, la, la, la!"
4894	15625	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, Bean and Bobby Wadkins will play in today's final round pairings.
4895	15626	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean and Wadkins, who shot a 67, are tied for second.
4896	15627	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Five others -- including Loren Roberts, Jim Thorpe and Gil Morgan -- are tied for fourth two shots back and 14players are within three shots of the lead.
4897	15630	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"I know I have to shoot at least this well (66) to have a chance."
4898	15631	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin had a three-shot lead after three holes when he made a 12-foot putt on the par-3 third hole.
4899	15632	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He was his typically consistent self -- hitting fairways and greens -- on the front nine.
4900	15633	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But Irwin struggled on the back nine.
4901	15637	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that I went from a two-shot lead to a one- shot lead."

4906	15660	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	THIS RESEARCH IS A JOKE
4907	15667	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
4908	15675	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
4909	15678	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
4910	15685	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
4911	15700	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck: Our business is picking up."
4912	15701	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes have common threads.
4913	15702	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
4914	15703	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
4915	15705	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean an ultimate dream.
4916	15706	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Humor pitfalls
4917	15708	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
4918	15711	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
4919	15712	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
4920	15717	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	People who were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
4921	15719	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One person makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the meeting.
4922	15720	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Someone else adds a funny thought.
4923	15721	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
4924	15722	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"The people who laugh together bond," Alleen Nilsen said.
4925	15726	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In the end, humor can help you cope with life's problems.
4926	15728	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's not a long-term solution, but it helps for a while."
4927	15729	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GOING WITH THE FLOW
4928	15732	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We went probably too far.
4929	15733	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was too much energy.
4930	15734	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
4931	15737	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow.
4932	15738	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art - but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum used to feel.
4933	15740	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
4934	15742	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
4935	15743	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
4936	15744	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
4937	15747	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
4938	15751	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
4939	15755	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
4940	15757	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	This is how visitors get around.
4941	15758	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for visitors to pause and relax.
4942	15759	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
4943	15761	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
4944	15770	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
4945	15776	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
4946	15777	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum.
4947	15779	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There's a dedicated space for traveling exhibitions.
4948	15781	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon Pain.
4949	15794	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's very important for visitors, and particularly for families, that they not feel crowded," says Kolb.
4950	15796	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new Touch Me Museum is three miles away from the old building.
4951	15797	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In an interview, Kolb doesn't even mention the building's architect.

4955	15805	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant to send a signal to children that the building might look different, but it's still their children's museum.
4956	15807	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There used to be two mock supermarkets on the third floor.
4957	15810	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	KidPower, in the front atrium on the ground floor, gives children a chance to launch tennis balls by pulling a rope attached to a bowling ball.
4958	15811	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	They can also move a sign up and down by using hand-pedaled bicycles.
4959	15812	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The three-story New Balance Climb has levels that are meant to resemble flying carpets.
4960	15813	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The device also offers one of the museum's best views - if you're willing to climb for it.
4961	15814	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The famous outdoor Milk Bottle (left) has been rebuilt, and a series of mazes - made of rock and brick - have been installed on a new plaza.
4962	15815	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Later this year, kids will be able to climb through a series of boulders installed in the area.
4963	15820	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may not spare them outfielders being eaten up by the expanded, all-color advertising/scoreboard walls, or pitchers limping off the field because they didn't down enough sports drink, but at least they won't have to suffer any more ignoble openers.
4964	15823	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	People fibbed and played hooky, and a few even legitimately took the day off for this.

4966	15827	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Only the Dodgers looked flat, lost the game 6-3 to the Rockies, lost two of their starting nine to injury and momentarily lost the momentum built after sweeping the evil Giants up north.
4967	15828	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Hey, but it was sunny and reasonably warm and the new parking scheme didn't turn into Chavez Ravine road rage and they still served Dodger Dogs.
4968	15830	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers never led this one, and the game was pretty much devoid of dramatics.
4969	15832	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There was plenty of pregame pomp and festivities, but in the end a lot of bunting left hanging around another loss.
4970	15833	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"We're glad it's over with," said Dodgers manager Grady Little.
4971	15837	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp has been off to a solid start, but in the fourth inning he chased a drive by Jeff Baker to the wall in right.
4972	15838	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The drive hit the wall at about the same time as Kemp.
4973	15840	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The video board is about double the size of last season's out-of- town scoreboard.
4974	15841	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's filled with stats and advertising, like the promise of "Oceans 13" coming June 8, or about the time I normally write off the Dodgers.
4975	15842	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's covered in plexiglass, which supposedly gives, but apparently not too much.
4976	15845	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit the video wall with his right shoulder and fell in a clump.
4977	15847	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"At first I thought it was worse than it was," he said.
4978	15850	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	New Dodgers trainer, and former Giants trainer, Stan "No Relation" Conte said X-rays were negative, revealing no fractures or apparent dislocation, but more would be known today.
4979	15852	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about that," Kent said.
4980	15854	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may have to go.
4981	15857	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, covering first, immediately grabbed the back of his right hamstring after hitting the bag.
4982	15858	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodger hearts dropped.
4983	15861	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"He'll be fine," Little said.
4984	15864	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It was that kind of goofy, not-quite-together opener.
4985	15865	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Things got off to a less than auspicious start when the two F-16s from Edwards Air Force Base that were supposed to fly over as the climax of the opening ceremony flew over Dodger Stadium before the anthem was even sung.
4986	15873	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Still, it was one game.
4987	15876	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	For openers, better games await.

5019	15953	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	They called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic meltdown on the Cape.
5020	15955	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
5021	15959	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
5022	15961	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
5023	15962	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of them have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the homes on the Cape and islands.
5024	15963	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan, which operates as an independent company but is financially backed by all of the state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
5025	15964	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's current base premium on the Cape is $1,155 and would rise to $1,444 if the pending rate increase is approved.

5030	15990	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the boulevard's exclusive shops and outdoor cafes had shut down, as their customers avoided the area.
5031	15997	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But the police are more visible, and mimes and street musicians now attract growing crowds.
5032	15998	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	A few reminders of the boulevard's past survive, like Suma, a cavernous bookstore, and the open-air Gran Cafe.
5033	16001	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
5034	16003	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
5035	16008	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
5036	16009	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle with each other outside."

5038	16015	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	An earlier effort would have been difficult.
5039	16017	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
5040	16021	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's revolution.
5041	16022	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedro Aponte, 72, a retired fruit seller, relied on nostalgia to discuss the boulevard's potential.
5042	16023	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We have to conserve this place," said Aponte he set up chess sets a recent morning under an awning, where a growing crowd gathers each day to play.
5043	16025	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls," Aponte reminisced.

5180	16377	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.

5230	16501	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The biggest question was how policymakers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
5231	16503	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
5232	16504	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
5233	16507	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.

5235	16512	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."

Huq, who directs the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center, argue that the Bush administration's "monarchist claims of executive power" are "unprecedented on this side of the North Atlantic," and that its "executive unilateralism not only undermines the delicate balance of our Constitution, but also lessens our human liberties and hurts vital counterterrorism campaigns" by undermining America's moral authority and standing in the world.
5239	16521	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
5240	16523	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Like many reporters Huq and Schwarz point out that expanded executive power was not a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 but the realization of a vision that conservatives like Dick Cheney had harbored since the 1970s, when they grew aggrieved over post-Watergate reforms that put the brakes on presidential power.
5241	16524	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	That conservative backlash gained ground during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in the minority report of the Iran-contra committee.
5242	16539	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."'

5272	16664	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
5273	16674	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The summary of the report was released at the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
5274	16675	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The bitter dispute surrounding the report's release suggests the depth of anger that remains, nearly six years after the fact, over where blame should be assigned for the intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
5275	16681	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of their errors amount to misconduct.
5276	16682	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
5277	16683	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It cited "failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow through with operations and to properly share and analyze critical data."
5278	16686	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	J. Cofer Black, the former director of the agency's Counterterrorist Center
5279	16687	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	and other top CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
5280	16688	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
5281	16689	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
5282	16694	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before Sept. 11, 2001.
5283	16696	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden.
5284	16697	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said the standoff had prevented CIA officials from gaining access to transcripts of intercepted communications between terrorism suspects, and criticized Tenet for not interceding to resolve these turf battles.
5285	16699	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
5286	16700	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
5287	16702	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed," he said.
5288	16710	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
5289	16715	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given three years under the law to develop a full inspection program, says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
5290	16718	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	They said the Bush administration's decision to implement the new law with a "certified shippers" program is only a slight improvement over the current system, which allows cargo from "known shippers" to be loaded directly onto passenger planes.
5291	16719	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The only difference is that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not have to meet security standards.
5292	16725	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline industry would even think that they could get away with anything less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto passenger planes," Markey said.
5293	16726	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.
5294	16727	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press conferences, and issued 17 news releases.
5295	16728	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He is known for using props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline cargo.
5296	16731	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
5297	16732	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The company that makes the machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without unpacking them.
5298	16733	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to enact a law requiring such screening.
5299	16736	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed Markey's proposal as part of the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act, which Bush signed Aug. 3.
5300	16737	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags" within three years.
5301	16738	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Many supporters of the bill assumed that meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either X-rayed or physically inspected.
5302	16741	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute does not require the screening to be performed on the airport premises or specify any screening method, but lists several examples of methods that would suffice, including X-ray machines, explosive detection systems, bomb-sniffing dogs, and a physical search.
5303	16746	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
5304	16747	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
5305	16750	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey said he is willing to give the TSA a chance to demonstrate that a "pack and seal approach" could really achieve the same level of security screening for bombs that checked luggage receives at airports, but expressed doubts.
5306	16751	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	If Congress decides that the final regulations for freight security are not truly "commensurate" with the level of security that checked bags receive, Markey said, he and other lawmakers will seek to change them.
5307	16752	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.

5316	16772	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	In July, Federer tied Bjorn Borg's record of five straight Wimbledon titles.
5317	16776	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	The victory at Wimbledon gave him his 11th major title.

5374	16969	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living.

5379	16988	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
5380	16989	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Let's take those one at a time.
5381	16990	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The "who's eligible, who's exempt?"
5382	16991	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
5383	16993	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
5384	16996	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
5385	16997	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
5386	17000	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Are you working again?
5387	17003	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone when you are technically off the clock?
5388	17007	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It absolutely counts."
5389	17008	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
5390	17011	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time."
5391	17013	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
5392	17014	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
5393	17015	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Of course, there are electronic records of work calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.

5395	17019	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"In a wireless world, nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
5396	17021	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
5397	17022	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens.
5398	17028	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?"'
5399	17029	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Thierman recalled.
5400	17033	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.
5401	17034	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Now back on the force, extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
5402	17036	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	In between bites of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he hates cops.
5403	17037	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is helpless when it comes to all the technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
5404	17038	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations, Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top of a gusher of emotion.
5405	17049	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in 1994, is promising.
5406	17050	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	While each episode will focus on a particular criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually.
5407	17053	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not long for the world?
5408	17056	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first place.
5409	17057	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or "the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.

5411	17065	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
5412	17067	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"It restored my faith in the legal system.
5413	17068	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The jury paid close attention."
5414	17072	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
5415	17077	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights to them.
5416	17079	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
5417	17081	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence or not, I don't know," Mann said.
5418	17082	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case, "so far as we know," is the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Mann said.
5419	17083	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
5420	17085	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image, but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered.
5421	17086	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
5422	17087	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"The axiom that the copyright is created when the image is created means nothing."
5423	17096	NYT_ENG_20071013.0017.LDC2009T13	The guys he is covering are 100 percent, and when you are playing the cornerback position, you have to be able to turn and run and get out of transition."

5449	17173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
5450	17175	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
5451	17179	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
5452	17180	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative thinking in some respects.
5453	17181	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
5454	17182	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the next president will confront and is still meeting for the first time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on particular subjects.
5455	17187	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said in a recent interview.

5457	17198	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.

5462	17212	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
5463	17214	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.

5465	17219	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."

5617	17701	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Klitschko's trainer, HBO commentator and legendary cornerman Emmanuel Steward, said it's no surprise.
5618	17707	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Klitschko takes no chances.
5619	17708	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	On a recent chilly day he brought heat lamps for the tent.
5620	17710	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	"We're thrilled to play in a different world."
5621	17711	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	He said boxing fits in with the resort's effort to be more hip.
5622	17712	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Many guests, he said, appreciate the glamorous side of the sport.
5623	17716	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Klitschko is enjoying his training here, where he is surrounded by members of his team.
5624	17720	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	But the fighter also grills lamb chops marinated in wine for his entourage.
5625	17722	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	His pal, Jurgen Rassman, whose company does marketing for PGA National, was raving about the resort.
5626	17723	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	Soon enough, Klitschko wanted to train in the same time zone as New York in a city with boxing fans, fair weather and a suitable gym.
5627	17727	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	He has not golfed, though, because he says he is a 36 handicap and can't tolerate the daylong depression a round would bring.
5628	17728	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	But Steward, 63, played for the first time in his life Wednesday.
5629	17730	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	The tent has a ring, a heavy bag, a full-length mirror and three flat-screen TVs on which Klitschko watches a constant rotation of Ibragimov's past wins.
5630	17735	NYT_ENG_20080123.0149.LDC2009T13	"Beat the bags, do the sit-ups.

5637	17751	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	But some observers think the Panthers haven't exhibited enough determination to reach the post-season for the first time since April 2000.
5638	17753	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"This team plays too much on the perimeter
5639	17754	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I haven't seen the willingness to get their noses dirty and do the dirty work," said NHL broadcaster John Vanbiesbrouck, who starred in the nets for the Panthers when they reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1996.
5640	17764	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack grittiness."
5641	17765	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I'm not talking about having enforcers
5642	17766	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	it's more banging in the corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their opponents," Green said.
5643	17768	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1 when trailing after the first period.
5644	17770	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They've got to be winning third periods.
5645	17771	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You can go into the third period down by one or two and still win that period.
5646	17772	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	(They) haven't been winning that period."
5647	17775	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While they rank second and third on the team in points, neither has had the breakout year many expected.

5650	17782	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	One line just isn't enough."
5651	17783	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost, Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
5652	17786	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Several players conceded that the team is maddeningly inconsistent.

5660	17803	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba (above) finds that life gets scary when her sight is restored.
5661	17805	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Directed by: David Moreauand Xavier Palud
5662	17811	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
5663	17815	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This isn't terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened yesterday.
5664	17816	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	(Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie critics.)
5665	17817	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of Hong Kong.
5666	17818	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a surprise, the movie was a drag.
5667	17820	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	.
5668	17823	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
5669	17826	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.
5670	17827	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But Alba, with her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan").
5671	17828	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.
5672	17830	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Her voice has pleasingly rich character.
5673	17832	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She narrates "The Eye."
5674	17833	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.
5675	17834	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	"People say seeing is believing... Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."

5679	17842	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
5680	17843	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished niceness she radiates on screen.
5681	17847	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.

5697	17893	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	After all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
5698	17901	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
5699	17906	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.
5700	17912	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
5701	17913	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt's concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, when it used its dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers and media players, according to people who have talked with Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not authorized to speak for him.
5702	17915	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
5703	17918	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
5704	17919	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.
5705	17921	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative desktop programs.
5706	17922	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
5707	17924	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"And that's why Microsoft is so eager to have a response.
5708	17925	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
5709	17927	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
5710	17928	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The longer Microsoft's purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online business remains unsettled.
5711	17931	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
5712	17932	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service.
5713	17934	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
5714	17935	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
5715	17936	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
5716	17938	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
5717	17955	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
5718	17959	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman paid two teenage boys money to pose nude and masturbate for photographs between 2006 and 2007, authorities say.
5719	17964	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	She said Zimmerman was so obsessed with talking to underage boys that he used his work computer to constantly ask them to send him pornography that he could sell.
5720	17967	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He said he wanted Zimmerman's parents to be present so they can testify that their son won't skip bail if he's granted a release.
5721	17969	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He returned to the jail Monday.

5723	17984	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told investigators the first victim showed him identification stating he was 18 years old, but Zimmerman said he suspected the card was a fake.
5724	17985	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says he also told investigators he knew the second victim, who was in foster care and was a runaway at one time, was 17 years old.

5790	18182	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when asked if the award had much meaning a continent away.
5791	18183	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an event."
5792	18186	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
5793	18188	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him.
5794	18190	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But by doing so, he's helping the Nazi war effort.
5795	18192	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Is Sally a hero?
5796	18193	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
5797	18194	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Neither?
5798	18199	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism isn't the point, Ruzowitzky said of Sally.
5799	18204	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.

5801	18208	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of Sally.
5802	18209	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
5803	18210	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he appears in "The Counterfeiters."
5804	18212	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Of course I look different," he said with a smile.
5805	18213	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to be in a concentration camp."
5806	18215	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
5807	18220	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger, who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his radical political views.
5808	18221	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He tried to sabotage the forgeries, risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
5809	18223	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
5810	18225	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	All these different perspectives are understandable.
5811	18226	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and is the one who stands up against the Nazis.
5812	18229	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Because in real life we can identify with his approach, which is, yeah, I'm just trying to get along, not change the world, be a human."
5813	18236	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
5814	18238	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
5815	18243	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Counterfeiters" makes clear the Nazis' evil, but that doesn't mean it fails to acknowledge the various moral complexities arising from the title characters' situation.
5816	18247	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"If you meet Mr. Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone: whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
5817	18248	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But as soon as he starts discussing these works of art they were producing there, and how well they worked, and even the Bank of England thought they were right, his eyes light up!
5818	18249	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's so proud, because he's a printer, and this was quite an achievement for them."
5819	18250	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The response to "The Counterfeiters" (it's been sold to more than 60 countries) speaks to a greater interest in German-language films generally, Ruzowitzky said.
5820	18253	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Entertaining may be the wrong word for a concentration camp movie, but it is accessible.
5821	18256	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign- language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for "The Counterfeiters."
5822	18258	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?'

5865	18382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
5866	18385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, citing ever-larger expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity to one another and to competing coffee shops.
5867	18386	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
5868	18388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
5869	18390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	As a barbershop quartet sang and employees dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
5870	18391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm.
5871	18392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks is his heart," said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was there with her husband, Bill.
5872	18393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I have every confidence he will turn the company around so this stock can take our family on our 50th wedding anniversary trip next year."
5873	18397	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
5874	18401	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He said 80 percent were usefully employed.
5875	18404	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases.
5876	18405	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He tested his patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to new drugs, then quantified the results.
5877	18407	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in an interview Thursday.
5878	18410	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and his contemporaries.
5879	18414	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In 1966, he established his own journal, the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
5880	18415	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It changed its name last year to Psychopharm Review.
5881	18416	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in higher doses were even more effective.
5882	18419	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo said.
5883	18420	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"This wasn't theoretical for him.
5884	18421	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This was about treating the patient with something that would help them."
5885	18422	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized mentally ill people being released without adequate support systems because of effective drugs.
5886	18424	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to equally strict analysis.
5887	18426	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist.
5888	18428	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His residency in pediatrics was interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a veterans' hospital.
5889	18430	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Some were violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from cold.
5890	18432	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd is quoted as saying in the biography.
5891	18433	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He had burns on at least 20 percent of his body.
5892	18434	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It fascinated me that he had no real sense of pain."
5893	18436	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The drug saved some from what then seemed to be unavoidable lobotomies.
5894	18437	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd went on to become chief of psychiatry at Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore from 1955 until 1962, then left to lecture in Europe.
5895	18438	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	From 1962 to 1965, he lectured at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
5896	18440	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In addition to his daughter Loretta, of Hunt Valley, Md., Ayd is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Rita Anne Corasaniti
5897	18447	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In an interview with Psychiatric Times in 2005, Ayd predicted many better drugs would be developed, but said the challenge was for doctors to learn to use them properly.
5898	18449	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	IN THE END, TENNESSEE LIVES UP TO SEEDING
5899	18455	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
5900	18458	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The dream was about to end.
5901	18459	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr did not make another 3-pointer, and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult 72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
5902	18462	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by spreading out the Volunteers on defense.
5903	18465	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's a race to the boards."
5904	18469	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I turned it into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him.
5905	18473	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
5906	18481	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Simon was averaging 7.2 points.
5907	18484	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference regular-season championship and was briefly ranked No. 1.
5908	18486	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did not show any discouragement afterward.
5909	18487	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"This is the NCAA tournament," Pearl said, "and no matter how we try and prepare you guys to understand that this is what it is, this is what you get, you just think that we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way."
5910	18492	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated on running and trapping.
5911	18493	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
5912	18494	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.
5913	18500	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
5914	18509	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA held Western Kentucky to 18.8 percent shooting in the first half and 34.7 for the game.
5915	18511	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Love had 15 first-half points while Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for seven points in 10 minutes.
5916	18512	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up, leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in anticipation of their game against Xavier.
5917	18513	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That game will be an intriguing matchup.
5918	18515	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	And those are only the ones from outside the Atlantic 10.
5919	18516	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut defense.
5920	18517	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked No. 5 nationally in scoring defense.
5921	18518	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins yield only 58 points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
5922	18523	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	M, a narrow Bruins victory.
5923	18524	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.
5924	18525	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	THORNTON HAD THE UPPER HANDS
5925	18529	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates, and his coach.
5926	18530	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks.
5927	18531	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's the best time of year to play - the last 10-15 games and the playoffs, that's what you're playing for.
5928	18532	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	As a kid, no one's saying, 'It's Game 22, who wants to play for the Cup?'
5929	18533	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	when you're playing road hockey."
5930	18534	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
5931	18535	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and Thornton helped shake it loose.
5932	18538	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on Reicher," said Thornton.
5933	18539	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see it because I was forechecking right away.
5934	18542	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period, but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded scrum.
5935	18543	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart skated slowly off the ice with his left arm hanging.
5936	18548	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I thought it was a high-stick ((on Stuart))," said Thornton.
5937	18549	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It was more reactionary than anything else.
5938	18550	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I had just come on the ice and I saw Stuart laying there.
5939	18551	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's our house and I don't want people taking liberties with one of my teammates, especially if I'm on the ice.
5940	18552	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I'm not going to let that slide."
5941	18555	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"He stepped up and did his job that way.
5942	18556	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Also, what hopefully didn't go unnoticed is that he played a solid game, too.
5943	18557	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	He was good along the wall, he was skating well, he got pucks in deep, and he played a pretty good hockey game tonight.
5944	18558	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"You have a tendency to think of those guys as one-dimensional players, but he played more and more as the game went on because he was so reliable."
5945	18560	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game," Stuart said.
5946	18562	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's anybody in the league I haven't got my mitts off with," he said.
5947	18563	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I can take care of myself, and if that has to be done, I don't put too much thought into it.
5948	18564	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Our line did a pretty good job going out there and maybe controlling the play in the other team's end and getting some bangs in.
5949	18568	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle- blowers.
5950	18571	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially.
5951	18572	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.
5952	18574	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice.
5953	18575	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Thus, if a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else -- like workers' compensation, a disability pension or Social Security -- the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that amount.

5993	18691	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening its belt.
5994	18695	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said second quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7 million, from $150.8 million a year earlier, while per-share earnings declined 21 percent, to 15 cents, from 19 cents.
5995	18696	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
5996	18698	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than- expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic environment as the weakest in the company's history.
5997	18699	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Wall Street analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
5998	18701	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
5999	18703	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbuck's shares.
6000	18706	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
6001	18709	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
6002	18713	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
6003	18715	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
6004	18716	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
6005	18717	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service.
6006	18719	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures.

6020	18763	NYT_ENG_20080506.0105.LDC2009T13	(St. Petersburg) - A photographer for the Times Publishing Co. was beaten and robbed Monday while trying to cover a celebrity's birthday party.
6021	18772	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.
6022	18777	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The local weekly twice called for him to leave office at the end of his term.
6023	18779	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	And in the midst of these battles, Cohen this week proposed increasing his salary of $97,876 by 28 percent, quickly withdrawing the idea after it was greeted with derision.
6024	18785	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"Nothing could be further from the truth."

6026	18787	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	and expensive technological efficiencies, like a fuel efficient heating system, account for the school's high cost, he said.
6027	18788	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He noted repeatedly that the project is "exactly the same" as it was when it was conceived, approved, and voted on by aldermen and taxpayers several years ago.
6028	18789	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing secretive about it," he said before cutting the interview short.
6029	18794	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's plans for the new Newton North High were clearly designed to meet that standard.
6030	18803	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Solomon said last night that he could not remember the circumstances of why the mayor may have left City Hall that day.
6031	18806	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She said it was a big change from her early days in office when Cohen invited board members to meetings in his office, and she thought they shared many similar views on education (she supported the new school) and the environment.
6032	18807	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She has since broken with Cohen.
6033	18812	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's refusal to acknowledge critics' concerns has baffled even supporters.
6034	18815	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was a state legislator, he called her to pose this Woody Allen-esque question: If police arrested Marcel Marceau, would officers have to mime him his Miranda rights?
6035	18823	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"And I'm sure he is, too."

6037	18833	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics didn't show up.
6038	18835	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
6039	18837	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The King carried his shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor).
6040	18839	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the second.
6041	18843	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Ray Allen shot 4 for 12.
6042	18846	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers.
6043	18847	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"I thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the game.
6044	18848	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	In every way they beat us tonight.
6045	18849	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They outcoached us, they played harder, they got the loose balls.

6048	18852	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Instead of being the solid defensive team that we've been, I thought we got down because our offense wasn't going."
6049	18859	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road this season.
6050	18860	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They swept through Texas, which is virtually impossible in today's NBA.
6051	18861	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And now they are neutralized and intimidated by the likes of Philips Arena and Quicken Loans Arena.

6061	18886	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We've got to come out in the first quarter and put up a better fight," said Celtics guard Sam Cassell.

6133	19104	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the field," the work carries no guarantee.
6134	19105	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
6135	19106	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
6136	19109	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
6137	19110	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
6138	19111	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.
6139	19112	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6?
6140	19113	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would the grumbling about Petrino's methods have been silenced?

6144	19128	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom Brady)?
6145	19130	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	With Michael, as spectacular as he was - not always great - with that kind of exciting player, he becomes in many ways the face of the franchise."
6146	19133	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of his reconfigured club, Blank says, "I have tremendous expectations this team will play hard and play well.

6152	19143	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The vast majority of patients don't fully understand the instructions they receive from doctors when they leave the emergency department, according to a new report.
6153	19145	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at two hospitals in southeastern Michigan.
6154	19147	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers then compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked whether the patients thought they had fully understood the instructions.
6155	19155	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.

6181	19238	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Russia had crossed "an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia," and should "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces," said McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in a hastily arranged statement delivered on an airport tarmac.
6182	19244	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama might respond to a crisis with international implications.
6183	19247	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has been criticized for cracking down on demonstrators last year, but McCain has been a loyal and longtime ally.
6184	19251	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of the statement.

6199	19322	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.

6209	19351	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Like two-thirds of Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of East Montpelier depend on wells.
6210	19352	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Some worry that a water-bottling operation will compromise their ability to shower and flush
6211	19355	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In March, the town of East Montpelier postponed any bottling for three years.
6212	19356	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in the company of a growing number of states, the legislature adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust.
6213	19357	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Beginning in 2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
6214	19358	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter than Vermont this summer).
6215	19360	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in northern Vermont, last summer during a drought.

6217	19372	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.
6218	19375	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected."
6219	19378	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There was a recognition by people that something was going to pass," he said.
6220	19382	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	But groundwater, until recent years, was often treated as something separate, hydrologically and legally.
6221	19384	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."
6222	19385	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Replenishment from rain or surface water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
6223	19391	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the moratorium.
6224	19394	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
6225	19395	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It is a beginning," she said.

6249	19461	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
6250	19462	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
6251	19467	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
6252	19469	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
6253	19471	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
6254	19474	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
6255	19476	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In TV commercials for Reebok and Expedia.
6256	19478	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In radio spots for Infiniti.
6257	19481	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
6258	19482	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
6259	19483	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
6260	19486	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
6261	19487	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
6262	19491	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.
6263	19499	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
6264	19500	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a miracle.
6265	19501	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
6266	19506	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
6267	19508	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said.
6268	19509	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I feel that I should have been able to make us better.
6269	19510	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't know how you can think any differently."
6270	19512	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
6271	19514	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
6272	19517	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage?
6273	19518	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
6274	19519	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?
6275	19520	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	How does his intense approach influence his players?
6276	19521	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
6277	19524	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'
6278	19525	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
6279	19526	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
6280	19527	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
6281	19528	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
6282	19529	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest morsel of data.
6283	19530	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
6284	19534	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for the YES Network.
6285	19540	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
6286	19541	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing to be positive, which obviously is what he's trying to do.
6287	19542	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	It's another thing to also be honest about how you really feel and what's going on.
6288	19543	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
6289	19544	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
6290	19545	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
6291	19548	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We suffer," Pena said.
6292	19557	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
6293	19558	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	In a move that is more about next season than this season, Girardi removed Cano from Sunday's game for not hustling on a fielding play.
6294	19561	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
6295	19562	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like beating a dead horse."
6296	19564	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
6297	19565	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He added that this season's experiences could cause him to change, too.
6298	19566	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi, like the Steinbrenners, said he did not consider a season triumphant unless it ended with a championship.
6299	19570	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"With this team, right now, the answer is no."
6300	19572	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The season will end in disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something Girardi had not envisioned.
6301	19573	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Stadium will close earlier than Girardi expected.
6302	19577	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from running for re-election.
6303	19586	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
6304	19588	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
6305	19594	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
6306	19597	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
6307	19600	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
6308	19601	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
6309	19602	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty, that they may not remain for a full third term.
6310	19605	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.

6313	19611	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
6314	19612	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
6315	19613	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Now, he added, "I could support the idea of a third term."
6316	19614	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in the New York Post.
6317	19618	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.
6318	19624	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
6319	19625	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
6320	19627	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through a spokesman that "It's illegal to run for a third term."

6361	19742	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues -- through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the election.
6362	19747	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.

6442	19943	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a handshake.

6451	19960	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
