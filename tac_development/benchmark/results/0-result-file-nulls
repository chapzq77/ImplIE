3367	13061	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	"Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast."
3368	13065	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	"Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached."
3369	13073	LTW_ENG_20070208.0110.LDC2009T13	"``In order to maintain that advantageous position for the play's investors, the producers will end the limited engagement three weeks earlier than originally announced (April 1).''"
3370	13077	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it."
3371	13078	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer does not offer health coverage."
3372	13080	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
3373	13082	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
3374	13083	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy Childers can better afford insurance?''
3375	13086	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"Currently, employers can deduct health- care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot."
3376	13087	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses."
3377	13088	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher."
3378	13090	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"Democrats, who took control of both chambers of Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become more affordable for the self-employed."
3379	13092	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	"In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns."
3380	13098	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	"Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the divisive issues."
3381	13099	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	"``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to find a way to live together,'' she said."
3382	13106	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	"She said a clearer understanding might emerge after two upcoming meetings: a gathering this weekend of its executive council, which includes bishops, clergy and laity, and of its House of Bishops in mid- March."
3383	13109	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.
3384	13111	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	"Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori advised."
3385	13113	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	"Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her concerns."

3388	13122	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days."
3389	13124	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day."
3390	13127	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week."
3391	13136	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair."
3392	13137	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''"
3393	13141	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
3394	13147	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	and signed up a talented team of Web designers at the company Blue State Digital to help power his online fundraising effort.
3395	13156	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaign has asked donors to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31 tally.
3396	13168	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Allies of McCain have argued that he got a late start on raising money.
3397	13169	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not years, before that announcement."
3398	13171	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	"A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary of state Henry Kissinger."
3399	13173	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His campaign began fundraising in earnest only in early March.
3400	13176	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"Well, The Washington Post's Web site screwed up the John Edwards story, too."
3401	13178	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety."
3402	13179	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at 12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House Bid.''"
3403	13180	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
3404	13182	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
3405	13185	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move quickly once the candidate announced his plans."
3406	13186	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady still isn't sure how the mistake happened.
3407	13187	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said."
3408	13192	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl DC.
3409	13193	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	"``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said."
3410	13194	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``We should have been up front.''
3411	13195	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Fishbowl DC posted a screen shot of the erroneous washingtonpost.com headline Friday morning.
3412	13196	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said his staff is investigating possible defects in their publishing tools to prevent a recurrence.

3419	13213	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	Cervical cancer is primarily a concern for older women.
3420	13215	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	"If a man uses a condom, neither partner will acquire HPV."
3421	13217	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The chances of getting HPV are slim.
3422	13229	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	The vaccine is not effective if a female is already sexually active.

3425	13243	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
3426	13245	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	"The virus is transmitted skin to skin, not through bodily fluids."
3427	13248	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	False.
3428	13249	LTW_ENG_20070404.0066.LDC2009T13	At least half of sexually active people will acquire genital HPV virus in their lifetime.

3444	13291	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back."
3445	13292	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government

3448	13301	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament."
3449	13302	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc."
3450	13303	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
3451	13305	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
3452	13306	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province."
3453	13307	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington."
3454	13308	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said."

3457	13315	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
3458	13316	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
3459	13317	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	"He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice."

3476	13392	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
3477	13394	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
3478	13395	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	"Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others."

3484	13409	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	"But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country."
3485	13411	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models."

3487	13420	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
3488	13425	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.

3879	14660	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed concert.
3880	14665	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage thing in the '70s.
3881	14666	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	"I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll concert."

3883	14672	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.

3886	14677	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The closest I come to collecting is buying tickets
3887	14678	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands I saw 30 years ago.

3907	14729	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	"But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints."

3914	14744	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	"Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting."
3915	14745	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.
3916	14746	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The researchers do not know why the drug interferes with HIV treatment.
3917	14751	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	"After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant."
3918	14752	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
3919	14753	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	"But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher."
3920	14756	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular administration.
3921	14757	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals."
3922	14759	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Co., Inc., had been bought out."
3923	14768	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector."
3924	14771	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"McCain, in a statement, said he would ""replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight,"" but also that a ""highest priority"" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. ""remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."""
3925	14772	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
3926	14773	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
3927	14774	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
3928	14775	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain."
3929	14779	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.

3932	14787	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court also will decide whether officials can be held liable for violations of rights that took place on their watch.
3933	14791	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	They are expected on Tuesday to announce they will hear a handful of those cases.

3936	14797	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The retirement of a single justice could tip the balance to the right or the left.
3937	14799	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"A second of the liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is 75, and could be replaced by the next president, particularly if the newly elected chief executive serves eight years in the White House."
3938	14800	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"So far, the court does not have before it a hot-button case on abortion, race or religion, although that could change after new cases are added in coming weeks."

3968	14928	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
3969	14930	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
3970	14931	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"With limited federal guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions, frequently shaped by political winds."
3971	14932	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
3972	14935	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
3973	14936	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
3974	14937	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The investment in a single patient can easily top $1 million over time.

3984	14965	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Other states have wavered.
3985	14966	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"North Carolina, for example, now provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants."
