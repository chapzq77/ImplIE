4013	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	One way commanders say they will try to meet that first deadline is by effectively reassigning combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the difference would be in some cases semantic because armed American troops would still go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.

4020	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Odierno said that it was particularly important for American troops to support Iraqis in 2009, when three elections, at the provincial, district and national levels, are scheduled.

6353	AFP_ENG_20070416.0099.LDC2009T13	"The main reasons are the prime minister's lack of response to the demands of nearly one million people in Najaf asking for the withdrawal of US forces and the deterioration in security and services," Rubaie told reporters.

6959	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general recommended that several top agency officials, including former director George J. Tenet, be held accountable for their failure to implement a strategy to dismantle al-Qaida in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks.

6969	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The full report by the inspector general, totaling several hundred pages, remains classified.
6970	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As spelled out in the executive summary that was released on Tuesday, the report found neither "a single point of failure" nor a "silver bullet" that would have allowed the CIA to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks.
6982	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general report said some 50 to 60 CIA officials knew of the intelligence about the two men, a higher number than had been previously reported, and that persistent surveillance of them "had the potential to yield information on flight training, financing and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11 attacks.
6985	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"Without such an effort, we would not have been able to give the president a plan on Sept. 15, 2001, that led to the routing of the Taliban, chasing al-Qaida from its Afghan sanctuary and combating terrorists across 92 countries," Tenet said in the statement.

John Warner and Richard Lugar, and it came as the Pentagon acknowledged that a decreasing number of Iraqi army battalions are able to operate independently of U.S. troops.
11648	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's factions, the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, pluralist, democratic government that is able to police itself, protect its borders, and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in the near future," the Warner-Lugar proposal said.
11652	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal states that "American military and diplomatic strategy in Iraq must adjust to the reality that sectarian factionalism is not likely to abate anytime soon and probably cannot be controlled from the top."
11653	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Accordingly, Warner and Lugar say Bush must draft a plan for U.S. troops that would keep them from "policing the civil strife or sectarian violence in Iraq" and focus them instead on protecting Iraq's borders, targeting terrorists and defending U.S. assets.
11654	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	At the Pentagon, meanwhile, Marine Gen.

12589	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Aboard Air Force 2, on a trip back from the launch of a battleship in Norfolk, Va., Cheney instructed his chief of staff, Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, about responding to a Time magazine reporter who questioned how the faulty intelligence on Iraq had become one of the Bush administration's central arguments for going to war.
12594	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Lea Anne McBride, Cheney's current spokesperson, said Thursday evening that the vice president's office could not comment on the case or evidence introduced in the trial.

14589	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Larger issues standing in the way of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians -- borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem -- were apparently not even seriously discussed at the summit.
14590	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert said in advance that the talks would be limited to humanitarian issues, reflecting his rejection of the current government headed by the violently anti- Israel Hamas.

15333	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Most allies agree, but Gates complained that some allies were balking at the plan for NATO to take on a task currently the responsibility of Afghanistan's fledgling police force.

15481	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	The leaders of Russia and Australia signed a deal Friday to export Australian uranium to fuel Russian nuclear power plants, and promised the atomic material would not be sold on to Iran.
15483	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	While the agreement forbids Russia from selling Australian uranium to any other nation or using it for military purposes, critics of the deal worry that it could make it easier for rogue states to obtain the raw material.
15484	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Asked whether Russia could be trusted not to sell Australian uranium to Tehran, Putin said his mineral-rich country already had an "excessive" supply of military-grade uranium that it was reprocessing and selling to U.S. power plants.
15486	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	He said Russia planned to build an extra 30 nuclear power plants over the next two decades and needed Australian uranium to complete the expansion.
15489	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Critics say the inflow of Australian uranium would allow Russia to divert its own supply of the atomic resource to military or export purposes.
15491	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	But "what that does is free up Russian sources of uranium, which they can then ship abroad."

16525	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The opposition has demanded more disclosure on the state of Yar'Adua's health and Nigerian media reported that Yar'Adua spent much of his trip to Saudi Arabia in a hospital undergoing treatment for his chronic kidney condition.
16526	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	While Yar'Adua has long been known to suffer from a kidney ailment, government officials say he traveled to Islam's holiest land primarily as a pilgrim, although they say he has consulted with doctors during his 16-day trip there.

16622	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Schwarz was chief counsel for the Church committee, which investigated executive branch overreaching in the mid 1970s, and he and Huq have done a powerful job of situating the actions of the current White House in perspective with the imperial presidency of Richard M. Nixon (who once declared that "when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal").
16625	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Like many reporters Huq and Schwarz point out that expanded executive power was not a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 but the realization of a vision that conservatives like Dick Cheney had harbored since the 1970s, when they grew aggrieved over post-Watergate reforms that put the brakes on presidential power.
16628	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	According to Huq and Schwarz the Iran-contra committee's minority report asserted that "the Chief Executive will on occasion feel duty bound to assert monarchical notions of prerogative that will permit him to exceed the laws," and it also argued that "the President's inherent powers" had historically allowed the executive to act "when Congress was silent, and even, in some cases, where Congress had prohibited an action."
16633	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although significant public and congressional attention was focused on the Patriot Act (which itself created an uproar over the threat it posed to Americans' civil liberties), Huq and Schwarz write, "the official responses to the September 11, 2001, attacks largely took shape through under-the-radar executive orders" that not only excluded Congress from the debate but in many cases also circumvented the interagency policy-making process, cutting out experts from the State Department and members of the uniformed military.

21979	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated," Bollinger told Ahmadinejad about the leader's Holocaust denial.

22142	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senior congressional aides said Wednesday that the White House has proposed limiting the much-anticipated appearance on Capitol Hill next month of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker to a private congressional briefing, suggesting instead that the Bush administration's progress report on the Iraq war should be delivered to Congress by the secretaries of state and defense.
22143	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials did not deny making the proposal in informal talks with Congress, but they said Wednesday that they will not shield the commanding general in Iraq and the senior U.S. diplomat there from public congressional testimony required by the war-funding legislation President Bush signed in May.
22147	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers from both parties are growing worried that the report -- far from clarifying the United States' future in Iraq -- will only harden the political battle lines around the war.
22150	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., told the White House that Bush's presentation plan was unacceptable.

22163	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Several Republicans have hinted that their support will depend on a credible presentation by Petraeus, not only of tangible military progress but of evidence that the Iraqi government is taking real steps toward ethnic and religious reconciliation.
22164	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	One of them, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., left for Iraq Wednesday night with Levin for his own assessment.
22168	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``If anything, we just don't know the dates/times/or the committees that the assessment will be presented to,'' a senior military official in Baghdad said in an e-mail Wednesday.
