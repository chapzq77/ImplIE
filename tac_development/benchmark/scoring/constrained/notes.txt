Notes by Stephen on tagging of constrained-answer-key:

Organizations are groups of people working together, and not buildings, facilities, or (sporting) events.  If there is a sense in which something can be an organization, consider it as such (e.g. a hospital is a building or an organization).

organizations:
  hospital, museum, stock exchange, bank, court, prison, church
not organizations:
  hotel, motel, airbase, office, district, airport, resort, marathon,
  olympics, shopping mall, auditorium, program
But proper names of airbases, police departments, etc. are organizations

person includes groups of individual people: team, family, delegation, 
  people, troops, (armed) forces, authorities, public, group, rebels,
  insurgents, community
but not population,refugee camp, delegation
does not include organizations: court, government, army, insurgency,
  police, navy
