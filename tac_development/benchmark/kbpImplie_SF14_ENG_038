sentenceOffset/Text 566: Chameau said Lange appeared to have taken his own life.


sentenceOffset/Text 631: Lange devoted his career to a haze of faint microwaves that pervade the sky, providing a whispery ghost image of the universe when it was only 400,000 years old, before there were stars, galaxies or even atoms.


sentenceOffset/Text 1567: Lange and his collaborators found that it was energy that was making it flat.


sentenceOffset/Text 1654: Lange was co-leader, with Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome, of an experiment called Boomerang, short for Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics.


sentenceOffset/Text 2420: Michael S. Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said of Lange, "He and his Boomerang team got one of the biggest prizes in cosmology: They were the first to show that the geometry of the universe is flat."

sentenceOffset/Text 2717: Lange was part of one of them, the Maxima experiment, which was led by his former professor Paul Richards of the University of California, Berkeley.

sentenceOffset/Text 3801: "So there are two very different lines of evidence indicating that the universe is accelerating," Lange said in an interview with the European Space Agency in 2001.


sentenceOffset/Text 3995: Andrew E. Lange was born in Urbana, Ill., on July 23, 1957, the oldest son of Joan Lange, a school librarian, and Albert Lange, an architect, and grew up in Easton, Conn.


sentenceOffset/Text 4330: While he was at Berkeley as a Packard fellow, Lange met another Packard fellow, Frances Arnold, a chemical engineer, who had attended Princeton and Berkeley when he did, but whom he had never met before then.

sentenceOffset/Text 4683: That same year Lange joined Caltech.


sentenceOffset/Text 4814: Lange, working with James Bock, now at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, built new detectors, known as spider web bolometers, designed for studying the cosmic microwave work.


sentenceOffset/Text 5177: Lange was part of the Planck team but, always eager to be in the forefront, was already working on ideas for new experiments.


sentenceOffset/Text 5347: Lange asked rhetorically in his 2001 interview.


sentenceOffset/Text 5562: His friends and colleagues described Lange as a warm man who always had a sparkle in his eye.
