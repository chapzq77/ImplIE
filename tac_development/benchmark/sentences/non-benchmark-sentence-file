2	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He was hailed as an economic hero by Time magazine, one of three influential economists credited with saving markets from the late-1990s Asian financial crash and setting Wall Street on top of the world.
3	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	The other two were his Treasury successor Larry Summers and former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan.
5	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He was until now the influential chairman of Citigroup's executive committee.
6	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	The 69-year-old New Yorker and graduate of Harvard and Yale started out in banking with the business lender Goldman Sachs in 1966, later to become one of its four partners.
7	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	Jay Tenenbaum, one of the Goldman Sachs bosses who first hired him, has said Rubin has a remarkable tolerance to risk.
8	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	Former colleague Stephen Friedman describes him as a pragmatist.
9	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	A committed Democrat, he left Wall Street in 1993 to join the administration of Bill Clinton as the then-president's economic policy adviser and head of the National Economic Council.
10	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He was named head of the Treasury in 1995, where he set about promoting a stronger dollar and helped the United States weather the Mexican financial crisis in 1995 and the Asian crash of 1997.
11	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He joined Citigroup in 1999 after quitting the Treasury and returning to New York to spend more time with his family.
12	AFP_ENG_20071105.0702.LDC2009T13	He worked on the bank's strategic and operational activities, and was regarded as the closest adviser of Prince, his outgoing boss.

15	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	A 31-year-old Greek man accused of beheading his girlfriend with a cleaver is in critical condition after being shot by police, Health Ministry officials said Monday.
16	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Police said restaurant cook Thanassis Arvanitis severed the head of his 25-year-old girlfriend Sunday on the holiday island of Santorini.
18	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	He was shot three times by police while trying to flee.
20	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	A 21-year-old Greek female tourist was hit by a ricocheting police bullet, while the suspect crashed into an oncoming motorbike, injuring two female doctors, both aged 26.
21	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Arvanitis and the three bystanders were being treated in a state hospital in Athens.
22	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The two doctors were making a good recovery after suffering leg injuries, said Health Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos.
23	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The tourist was in stable condition.
24	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	The injured policeman received treatment for facial wounds on Santorini.
25	APW_ENG_20080804.0425.LDC2009T13	Following an argument, "the (suspect) slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman ... totally severing her head," a statement from the South Aegean Police Department said.

29	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-03-19 00:16:04 UTC
30	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Senior European Union representatives were to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday to prepare the ground for an EU-U.S. summit on April 30 in Washington.
31	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, along with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner were also expected to discuss issues including the Middle East, Iran's nuclear program and the future status of Kosovo with Rice.
32	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	The April summit is expected to consider a proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a trade deal that would help eliminate some regulatory barriers hindering companies in the U.S. and EU from doing business with each other.
33	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Following the meeting with Rice, the three European representatives were to participate in a corporate forum on energy technology research to be chaired by Rice and Steinmeier.
34	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Ahead of Steinmeier's departure from Germany on Sunday, the German foreign minister suggested that the U.S. plan to build a missile defense system in Europe-- an issue that has been a point of contention -- has merits.
35	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	But in an opinion piece for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung printed Sunday, Steinmeier said an open dialogue was needed to address concerns from all sides.
36	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	"Given the strategic nature of such a project, I would advocate proceeding carefully with intensive dialogue with all partners involved, whether directly or indirectly," Steinmeier said.
37	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Russia has vigorously opposed the idea for the missile program, saying that placing systems in Poland and the Czech Republic which are close to its border could diminish its nuclear deterrent.
38	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	While the U.S. has tried to allay those concerns with assurances that the deterrent was intended to counteract Iran's developing missile program and the small number of installations would have little effect on Russia's thousands of missiles, Moscow has remained unconvinced and has suggested the deployment could lead to a new arms race or rekindling of the Cold War.
39	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Steinmeier had previously roiled U.S. officials by suggesting that the United States should have included Russia in discussions on the program.

42	AFP_ENG_20080106.0100.LDC2009T13	Bombs exploded outside three churches and a monastery in the main northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Sunday, wounding four people and slightly damaging the buildings, police said.
43	AFP_ENG_20080106.0100.LDC2009T13	The four civilians were hurt when a bomb planted in a parked car went off outside the Church of the Virgin Mary in east Mosul.
47	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	DAMASCUS, Syria 2008-03-27 17:18:23 UTC
49	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The League will hold its yearly summit this weekend in Damascus, and has listed a review of the financial situation high on its agenda, along with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Lebanon's presidential election standoff and the Iraqi crisis.
50	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	According to the report prepared by Secretary General Amr Moussa, the League faces a US$22 million (euro13.94 million) deficit, or about 60 percent of its annual budget.
51	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	Member states have paid only 86 percent of their contributions due for 2006 and 2007, said the report, stating that members owed US$88 million (euro55.75 million) in contribution arrears.
53	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	But the report showed that some wealthy Gulf countries such as Qatar and Kuwait have reservations on their share of the budget --despite a boom in oil prices that has generated billions of dollars of additional revenues-- while poor nations like Somalia and Djibouti can't afford to pay their due.

56	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Tenor Placido Domingo peppered his classical repertoire with a crowd-pleasing array of popular music and even donned a mariachi suit and sang along with the audience, smoothing over controversy surrounding his Saturday concert at the Mayan pyramids of Chichen Itza.
57	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	With help from Mexican crooner Armando Manzanero and Puerto Rican soprano Ana Maria Martinez, an ebullient Domingo won over the crowd with encores ranging from West Side Story's "Tonight," to the popular ballad of southern Yucatan state, "Peregrina."
59	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The singers were dwarfed by the hulking mass of the site's main pyramid, eerily illuminated in red against a black sky, and the concert began with Mayan-style music from by The Monumental Chorus of the Mayab, accompanied by Indian drums
60	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins.
61	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The concert's name is a reference to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.
65	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the site will be damaged.
66	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	This is a controlled event," Segovia said.
67	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Karen Eddy, originally of Toronto, Canada, traveled to the concert from her current home in Mexico City because "I thought it would be magical, just magical" to see Domingo sing in front of the towering main pyramid.
68	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and activists have complained that concerts like Saturday's expose ruin sites to additional damage and degrade their cultural significance by treating them as mere backdrops.
69	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Mexico's federal government turns down most requests to hold concerts at ancient temples.
70	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But it faces increasing pressure from state governors to promote ruins which, critics argue, are already swamped with tourists.
71	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Officials did impose limits on stage and seating structures and the number of spectators for Domingo's concert, ensuring that it would be smaller than tenor Luciano Pavarotti's 1997 appearance at Chichen Itza, which drew 17,000.
72	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Since then, more than a half dozen concerts have been held at or near the ruins.
73	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Despite intermittent drops of rain, Domingo opened masterfully with the inspiring "O Souverain" from Massenet's Le Cid.
74	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo and local hero Manzanero won a standing ovation for a duet -- which the Mexican sang party in Mayan -- on Manzanero's love ballad "Adoro."
76	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The Indian language is still spoken by almost a million people in the region.
78	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Many here see it like a homecoming
79	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	one of Domingo's first performances was in Yucatan in 1957.
80	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo sang Zarzuela from his native Spain, and drew a swell of applause for the classic Granada.
81	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But the audience went wild when, in an encore, Domingo donned a silver-buttoned suit like the ones used by Mexico's cowboy- singers and belted out mariachi classics like "El Rey", at times asking the audience to sing along.
83	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The classical repertoire ended on a strong note with "No Puede Ser" from Sorozabal's La Tabernera del Puerto.

85	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Two more suspects in China's tainted milk scandal were set to go on trial Tuesday, bringing the number to 17 who are facing court over the nation's worst food safety case in years.
87	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	At least six babies in China died this year and 294,000 fell ill after drinking milk laced with melamine, which is normally used to make plastic.
88	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The chemical was mixed into watered-down milk to make it appear richer in protein, but it caused severe kidney and urinary tract problems in babies who drank contaminated milk powder.
89	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The Gengs are accused of being "middlemen" who added melamine into milk, which was then sold to Sanlu, the largest Chinese dairy producer to have become embroiled in the scandal.
90	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Officials at the court in northern Shijiazhuang city refused to comment on the proceedings, but the China News Service said notices of Tuesday's trials were posted at the courthouse.
91	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	On Monday, nine people suspected of trading or producing the tainted additives went on trial in Shijiazhuang and surrounding districts, while five others were tried on Friday last week.
92	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	In China, trials often last just one day and verdicts are announced soon after.
93	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The verdicts in the milk trials will be "announced at an appropriate time," state press reports said, giving no other details.
94	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The scandal, which emerged in September after initially being covered up, shook the foundations of a Chinese food industry that was already beset by repeated safety problems.
95	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	It quickly became a major global concern after contaminated Chinese milk products were found abroad, leading to recalls around the world.
96	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The former head of the Sanlu Group, Tian Wenhua, is set to go on trial in Shijiazhuang on Wednesday with three other top company officials.
97	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The group was once one of China's leading dairy producers but last week filed for bankruptcy due to the losses it incurred over the scandal.
98	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Lawyers seeking to file lawsuits against the company have said Tian could be facing a long jail term or even the death penalty.

101	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew.
102	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the phone in the other room, Michelle is pleading with the utility company to keep their power on.
103	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?"
104	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	asks her husband, Troy, who served as an Army scout in Baghdad and came back with post- traumatic stress disorder.
106	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government's sweeping list of promises to make wounded Iraq war veterans whole, at least financially, has not reached this small house in the hills of rural West Virginia, where one vehicle has already been repossessed and the answering machine screens for bill collectors.
107	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
108	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After revelations about the poor treatment of outpatient soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center earlier this year, President Bush appointed a commission to study the care of the nation's war-wounded.
109	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The panel returned with bold recommendations, including the creation of a national cadre of caseworkers and a complete overhaul of the military's disability system that compensates wounded soldiers.
110	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But so far, little has been done to sort out the mess of bureaucracy or put more money in the hands of newly disabled soldiers who are fending off evictions and foreclosures.
112	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
113	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But since Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
114	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
115	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You need two college degrees to understand any of it," she says, lacking both.
116	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
117	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A psychotic Vietnam vet she met in a VA hospital was the one who told her that Troy might be eligible for Social Security benefits.
118	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or randomly explosive.
119	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
120	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
121	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't make decisions.
122	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is a worrywart.
123	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Fearful.
124	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's like they took Troy and put him in a different person."
125	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	As thousands of war-wounded lug their discharge papers and pill bottles home, more than a quarter are returning with PTSD and brain trauma.
126	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Compensation for these invisible injuries is more difficult and the social isolation more profound, especially in rural communities where pastures outnumber mental health providers.
127	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's one-year war has become his wife's endless one.
128	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live in a small rental house in the northern tip of West Virginia, surrounded by enormous blue sky and the dark spine of South Branch Mountain.
130	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After one of his distraught soldier buddies from Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy stays away from alcohol.
132	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle thinks Troy's anxiety and depression are worsening, and she tells anyone who will listen -- her pastor, doctors and counselors at VA.
134	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The meds give him tremors.
135	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He used to cut the grass and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a perpetual patient.
136	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle for everything.
137	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?"
138	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	he asks one day.
139	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle takes a breath.
140	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Orthopedic," she says.
141	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Troy, (ital) please try."

143	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At 31, her eyes are hollowed by worry and her brown hair is turning gray.
144	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
145	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The all-day journey requires a babysitter for the kids -- ages 10 and 11, both from previous marriages -- and burns $25 worth of precious gas.
146	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
147	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	One hot morning, they set out for Martinsburg yet again.
148	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury -- he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital wants him back for more comprehensive testing.

152	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's pill box is between them, along with the silence.
154	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
156	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy, in the passenger seat, keeps his eyes on the road.
158	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
160	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A laconic country boy with a plug of tobacco in his cheek, Troy was a cavalry scout with the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment that pressed into Baghdad.
161	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
162	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's problems started after his tour.
163	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While he was on home leave from Fort Stewart one weekend, Michelle found him sitting on the bed with a bottle of pills.
164	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he couldn't go back.
167	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
168	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
169	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
170	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.
171	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship, she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat her well.
172	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
173	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
174	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
175	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His family needed the $2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in the truck with him.
177	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA rated Troy's disability level at 50 percent, resulting in $860 a month in compensation.
181	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners' foothold in working-class America completely slid away when Michelle -- who has worked as a teacher's aide and an inventory-control specialist at Wal-Mart -- developed health problems and was forced to quit her job.
182	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
184	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The concrete behemoth serves 129,000 vets from West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
185	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
186	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle and Troy move down the hallways, passing a room near the PTSD residence where a group of young vets, some tattooed and still muscled from the desert, are playing a game of ring toss.
189	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle tells him what day it is.
190	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They sit together on the hard chairs until Troy's name is called.
192	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A former Marine with ramrod posture, the vet has PTSD and an encyclopedic knowledge of VA procedures.
193	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
196	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
198	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She returns to the waiting room.
199	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
201	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse.
202	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
203	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
204	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in again.
205	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She knocks on the door of a counselor, a big, bald, friendly man who does not wave off the intrusion.
206	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You think he's violent at this point?"
207	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.
208	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle dodges the question.
209	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He's not getting any counseling," she says, leaning against the door.
211	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
212	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle's voice breaks.
213	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I know you are doing the best you can," she says.
214	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anymore, he's just ashamed.
215	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	I wish I had a video camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an average day looks like."
216	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests.
217	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
220	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately the doctor is on leave for the next month.
221	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The first available slot is five weeks out, at 8:30 a.m.
222	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
223	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
224	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have a three-hour drive."
225	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Nine o'clock is the they best they can do.
226	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
227	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office on the first floor.
228	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government has promised to care for its wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this, where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage reimbursed.
229	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977.
230	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is still paid 11 cents a mile.
231	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
232	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
236	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.
237	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they had no other choice.
240	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function without her.
241	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
242	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
243	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.
244	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But at least now she has the help of an assistant officer with the West Virginia Division of Veterans Affairs in a little office in Moorefield, about 30 miles from Romney.
245	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
246	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is "chronic and severe."
247	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle gets copies of the medical records and sits down with them on her living room floor.
248	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Wearing an Army T-shirt that says "Got Freedom?"
249	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	she begins reading.
251	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels sickened.
252	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(begin ital)
253	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has nightmares frequently, two to three times a week, in which he sees himself back in Iraq ... and Baghdad.
255	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he hears bullets passing over his head.
257	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Flashbacks are also frequent, 2 or 3 times a week, triggered by helicopters passing over, burn flesh smell, barbecue, current Iraq news and sometimes seeing military vehicles brings flashbacks.
258	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(end ital)
259	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle goes page by page.
260	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is in his recliner holding the remote control.
261	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From time to time she looks up at him, then her eyes go back to the records.

263	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has a lot of guilt feelings that he could not save his sergeant.

265	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She comes to a page that lists Troy's problems.

267	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Hearing loss.

273	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle calls out to Troy.
274	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They are saying your memory is extremely low," she says.
275	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"And here's another thing.
277	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
278	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA concludes that Troy's worsening condition merits an increase of his disability rating to 70 percent, raising his monthly check to $1,352 a month.
282	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
284	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
285	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
286	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
287	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.
288	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
289	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	During the intake session in Martinsburg, he is withdrawn and sullen.
290	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
291	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The news punches Michelle in the gut.
292	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is allowed to come home on weekends, so Michelle makes the four-hour round trip to pick him up on the first Friday night.
293	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
294	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
295	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
297	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA tells Michelle that a contract counselor who visits rural counties will be in touch to schedule time with Troy.
298	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
299	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
300	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners decide to pack up and leave their $475-a-month rental house for a $450-a-month mobile home in Moorefield to save money and be near Troy's mother for help.
301	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They are strained beyond belief.
302	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, there are moments of gallows humor.
303	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
304	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy kids Michelle.
305	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
306	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
308	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
309	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he says.
310	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle raises an eyebrow.
312	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
313	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Plus, the fact that guys are missing arms and have bullet holes and everything else.
314	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Ain't a scratch on me."
315	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	To remember who Troy used to be, Michelle keeps a photo of him hidden in her camera case.
316	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the picture he is smiling and eager, ruggedly at home in his Army fatigues.
317	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now she looks at the man in the recliner.
318	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's people like you that made our country," Michelle says.
319	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back to filling out forms, and Troy goes back to Nickelodeon.
321	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
322	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Garrison Carr, an American University guard, had just made another 3-pointer and the 15th-seeded Eagles trailed by a point with six minutes remaining against second-seeded Tennessee on Friday in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
323	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Scared?"
324	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee forward Tyler Smith said.
325	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't say scared.
326	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
327	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The arena section where American fans were sitting was revved up and hoping for more of Carr.
328	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The American band played the song "Don't Stop Believin"' and a fan held up a sign that read "The American Dream."
329	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The dream was about to end.
330	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr did not make another 3-pointer, and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult 72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
331	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr, a 5-foot-11 junior from the Seattle area, scored a game- high 26 points, making 9 of 21 field goals.
332	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	For most of the game, he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the Tennessee defense.
333	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by spreading out the Volunteers on defense.
334	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Tennessee big men were stuck outside trying to help on screens being set for Carr.
335	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
337	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The difference in the game was a two-minute stretch that ended with about four minutes left in the second half and with Tennessee holding a comfortable lead.
338	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	JaJuan Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, was playing tough defense on Carr, staying closer than arm's reach, and would not let him get another good look at the rim.
339	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said.
340	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I turned it into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him.
341	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	I wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
342	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for Tennessee.
343	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a 3 down," Carr said.
344	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
345	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Volunteers took a 63-53 lead as American managed just one field goal over its next nine possessions.
346	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Smith finished with 19 points to lead Tennessee.
347	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Carr plays 40 minutes and Mercer plays 39," Pearl said, referring to American guard Derrick Mercer.
348	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
349	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31 free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.
350	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Chris Lofton, Tennessee's leading scorer (16.1 points), was only 1 of 7 from the field.
351	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament.

385	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GOING WITH THE FLOW
386	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Back in the 1970s, when Lou Casagrande was starting out as a curator at the Science Museum of Minnesota, visiting a museum aimed at kids sometimes felt like being in a "pinball machine."
387	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"My instructions were to create energy and hands-on in every nook and cranny," said Casagrande, who eventually became senior vice president at the Minnesota museum before taking over as director of the Boston Children's Museum in 1994.
388	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We went probably too far.
389	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was too much energy.
390	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
391	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	That was then.
392	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Now, as Casagrande readies the Children's Museum for its April 14 reopening, he's talking up the new exhibitions, from the tennis ball launcher to a light-box dance floor.
393	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow.
394	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art - but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum used to feel.
395	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"For us," Casagrande says, "this is the biggest revolution."
396	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
397	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some spots - the fourth floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible to find.
398	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
399	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
400	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
401	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new building won't alleviate all these problems.
402	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But several key design features should help.
403	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
404	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors, some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
405	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	While many a city has gotten into the children's museum business lately, Boston's edition has a long history.
406	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1913 and housed in Jamaica Plain, the museum opened its current home in Fort Point Channel in 1979, renovating a 19th-century wool warehouse.
407	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
408	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	After two decades in its spot, the museum undertook a renovation plan, closing on Dec. 31 to complete its current expansion.
409	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled, rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front of the taller, existing brick warehouse building.
410	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The defining feature of the newer space is its open feel.
411	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
412	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A series of 10- to 12-foot-wide hallways, reached by a stairway or elevator and stretching the entire length of the expansion, connect the new section with the old.
414	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for visitors to pause and relax.
415	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
416	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Visitor flow has driven the new project to the point that the expanded Children's Museum isn't actually all that much bigger than the old space.
417	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
418	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	How can an expanded museum be barely expanded?
419	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the institution's needs.
420	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"You can't just use kind of the multiple of going from x square feet to y," said Thomas E. Moloney, chairman of the board.
421	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing is the museum becomes much more functional."
422	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Consider how the space is used.
423	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The fourth floor is now off limits to visitors, used mainly for offices.
424	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A bigger and technologically updated KidStage has moved from the tucked away corner to the ground floor.
426	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
427	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Wide doorways have been cut into the brick that used to be the outside of the museum.
428	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Each gallery is accessible through the bridges.
429	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the ease with which its visitors walk through the building.
430	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Smaller, newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
431	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"A museum at the stage Boston's at, where it's been around for so many years, it has the square footage to focus more on visitor flow," says Janet Rice Elman, executive director of the Association of Children's Museums.
432	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
433	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum.
434	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The KidPower section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move an exhibit sign up and down.
436	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story climb.
437	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon Pain.
438	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But what excites Gail Ringel, the museum's vice president of exhibits, is the 3,000-square-foot second floor space known as The Common.
439	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs, and a giant chess game.
440	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But in less than an hour, the staff can break down, and move out, all the activities.
441	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	What's left is a large, central space for groups to gather.
442	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We get literally thousands of people here for Chinese New Year and St. Patrick's Day," says Ringel.
443	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We hosted significant performances from area artists, dancers, and musicians in there, and it was a serious impediment to flow in the museum.
444	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The Common is going to be a very important space.
445	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It'll give families a space to sort of rest and recharge.
446	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then when we're having our large festival days, the exhibits can be swept out."
448	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In Philadelphia, the Touch Me Museum is constructing an $88 million building set to open next year.
451	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's scary enough to come into a city."
457	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Old reliables, new surprises
458	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	When the expanded Children's Museum reopens on April 14, there will be a little of the old, and a little of the new.
459	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Here are a few familiar exhibitions, and a few potentially exciting new stops.
461	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant to send a signal to children that the building might look different, but it's still their children's museum.
463	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There used to be two mock supermarkets on the third floor.
464	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	One is gone, but the Colmado has been restocked, and is pretty much the way it was.

467	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	They can also move a sign up and down by using hand-pedaled bicycles.
468	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The three-story New Balance Climb has levels that are meant to resemble flying carpets.
469	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The device also offers one of the museum's best views - if you're willing to climb for it.

474	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 2007-11-16 12:36:37 UTC
475	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	One of Amsterdam's best-known sex clubs has become the latest victim of the city's crackdown on organized crime infiltration of the city's world famous sex industry.
476	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The Yab Yum club, located in a historic canalside mansion in downtown Amsterdam, has long been an exclusive hang out for well- heeled businessmen and tourists, but city fathers now believe its owners could be engaging in "criminal transactions" and have revoked its permit, Amsterdam Municipality spokesman Hendrik Wooldrik said Friday.
478	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal activities.
479	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The owners were allowed to respond to the conclusion, but could not convince the city not to withdraw its license, the municipality said in a statement.
481	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The club's owners have been ordered to close it down within weeks, but can appeal the decision to pull its license, Wooldrik said.
482	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Nobody answered the phone at Yab Yum on Friday.
483	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Entry to the club costs euro70 (US$100), according to its Web site, which shows pictures of an ornate bar and private rooms featuring double beds and huge bath tubs.
484	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, but Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen says he wants to root out the "underlying criminality" linked to the city's famed Red Light District.
485	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	In September, the city announced that a public housing corporation had bought 18 buildings in the Red Light District to redevelop them -- a deal that could lead up to the shuttering of one third of the windows where scantily clad prostitutes stand to attract customers.

489	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The declassified key findings, to be released publicly on Tuesday, were obtained in advance by The Associated Press.
491	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	As expected, however, the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
495	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments of the 16 spy agencies across the breadth of the U.S. government.
502	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Among the report's other findings:
504	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
510	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The judgments do not name any specific groups, but the FBI often warns of violent environmental groups, such as Earth Liberation Front, and others.
511	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are part of a longer document, which remains classified.
512	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It was approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
513	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	In the last week, reports on this document and another threat assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
514	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The White House has used the reports as evidence that the country must continue to go after al-Qaida in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
515	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But critics say the evolving threat is evidence of a policy gone wrong.
516	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The debate -- and the underlying global problem -- will not go away soon.
517	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas, especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is expanding.
518	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ... points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate," the estimate said.
519	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"We assess that this internal Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in Europe, however."

522	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
523	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
524	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
525	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But they say the plan would also impose international supervision, much like what exists in Bosnia, in what appears to be an attempt to provide protection for Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority.
526	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
527	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to the plan.
528	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The proposals foresee a strong international presence for the indefinite future, and include "a lot of measures to guarantee and promote the rights of the minority communities," Remi Dourlot, Ahtisaari's spokesman, said in Vienna.
531	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.
532	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
534	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	It will be presented to the Serbian and Kosovo governments on Feb. 2.
536	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.
537	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Russia, which supports Serbia's efforts to keep Kosovo as a province, wants the Security Council vote delayed until Serbia has formed a government, diplomats in Vienna say.

539	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	CONAKRY, Guinea 2007-03-21 10:55:05 UTC
540	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	A bridge collapsed under an overloaded truck in Guinea, throwing scores of passengers into a river and killing at least 70, the West African country's state radio reported Wednesday.
541	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The truck was ferrying merchandise and people back from a local market near the southeastern town of Gueckedou when the accident occurred Sunday, state-run RTG radio reported.
542	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The 50-year-old rock and cement bridge collapsed as the truck was crossing, tipping the vehicle and sending people as well as bags of cement and sacks of rice crashing into the river.
543	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Many of the dead drowned, trapped under the merchandise, RTG said.
544	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	At least 20 people were injured and were taken to hospital, the radio station reported.
545	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Some later died of their injuries.
546	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The death toll rose from 65 overnight to 70 Wednesday morning, the radio said, citing hospital sources.
551	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	CAUTION, NOT PANIC, SEEN AFTER DRUG WARNINGS
552	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	A new study may help quiet fears that the suicide warning labels on antidepressants are scaring countless patients away from medications that could help relieve their suffering.
553	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The warnings, which were mandated in 2004 by the Food and Drug Administration, say the drugs can increase the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior in some young patients.
554	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They stirred a fierce debate among psychiatrists, health officials and patient advocates, with critics saying the ruling (and the headlines that accompanied it) went too far.
555	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the study, which appears Tuesday in The Archives of General Psychiatry, finds that while the warnings appear to have alerted patients and doctors to a possible risk, they have not caused a sharp decline in treatment rates.
556	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The report is not likely to be the last word on the antidepressant debate, experts said.
557	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But they added that it provided one of the clearest pictures to date of how patients and doctors behaved in the wake of a controversial decision by drug regulators.
558	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The researchers analyzed prescription rates from three time periods: May 2002 to June 2003, just before the debate over antidepressant side effects flared
559	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	June 2003 to October 2004, the period after the first public alert, that the drug Paxil by GlaxoSmithKline was associated with an increase in suicidal thinking in minors
560	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	and October 2004 to December 2005, the year after the FDA called for prominent warnings on the labels of all antidepressants.
561	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They found that the rate of Paxil prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased by 44 percent after the 2003 warning on that drug.
562	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the rate for similar drugs, including Prozac by Eli Lilly, continued to increase in that age group through 2003 and fell off only slightly after the labeling change, in 2005.
563	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The rate of prescriptions to new patients -- a particular concern for psychiatrists critical of the warnings -- did not change significantly during the warnings or after.
564	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	Prescription rates to adults increased in the years studied.
565	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	In sum, the drug agency's warnings seemed to prompt caution rather than panic.
566	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	"The concern that the warnings would have a chilling effect on the treatment of depression in young people was not borne out by the data," said the study's lead author, Mark Olfson, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.
567	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	His co-authors were Steven C. Marcus of the University of Pennsylvania and Benjamin G. Druss of Emory University.

571	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Andy Bean gave his driver to a kid who was sitting in the stands at the 18th hole after the first round of the AT&amp

575	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"You've either got to take it or I'm going to break it," Bean told the boy.
576	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"He was happy, and I was happy to get rid of it."
577	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean was happy with the results of the driver he used Saturday.
578	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He used a driver he'd tried earlier in the year on the Florida swing.
579	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	It was one of 40-some drivers he's tested this season.
580	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hit 12 of 14 fairways -- four more than the previous day -- and shot a 6-under 66 to put himself in contention at Valencia Country Club.
581	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Hale Irwin, who had a two-shot lead after Friday's first round, struggled to a 1-under 71 but leads by one shot.
583	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	When asked about his success while playing with the lead, Irwin stuck his fingers in his ears and said, "La, la, la, la, la, la!"
584	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, Bean and Bobby Wadkins will play in today's final round pairings.
585	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean and Wadkins, who shot a 67, are tied for second.
586	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Five others -- including Loren Roberts, Jim Thorpe and Gil Morgan -- are tied for fourth two shots back and 14players are within three shots of the lead.
587	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But seeing Irwin's name at the top of the leaderboard can't be too comforting for the rest of the field.
588	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"Trying to make up shots on Hale isn't the easiest thing in the world," Bean said.
589	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"I know I have to shoot at least this well (66) to have a chance."
590	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin had a three-shot lead after three holes when he made a 12-foot putt on the par-3 third hole.
591	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He was his typically consistent self -- hitting fairways and greens -- on the front nine.
592	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But Irwin struggled on the back nine.
593	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He started with an errant drive to the left on No. 17 and had to scramble, eventually sinking a 5-foot putt for bogey .
595	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that it's over, and I'm in the lead," Irwin said.
596	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that I went from a two-shot lead to a one- shot lead."
597	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hopes they can both put their best golf on display.
598	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"When you beat him, you usually beat a guy that doesn't make mistakes," Bean said.
599	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"To me, that's fun.
600	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Your games are both there.

603	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES, May 24 (Xinhua)
604	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Seven best-known beaches in the Los Angeles County rank among California's 10 most polluted, according to an annual environmental report.
605	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	For the second straight year, Los Angeles County had the worst coastal water quality in the state for the 12 months ending March 31, said the report by the environmental group Heal the Bay.
606	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Although record low rainfall made most of California's coastal waters safer to bathe in over the past year by reducing contaminated storm and creek runoff into the ocean, it wasn't enough to improve potentially risky bacteria levels at some of Los Angeles County's best known beaches, according to the report published by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
607	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	The nonprofit group assesses daily and weekly fecal bacteria pollution from nearly 500 California beach sites from Humboldt County to the Mexican border, giving each a grade of A through F.
608	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Beaches rated F included Surfrider and Marie Canyon storm drain in Malibu, Santa Monica Municipal Pier area, Castle Rock in the Pacific Palisades area, and Avalon on Catalina Island.
609	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Higher bacteria counts raise the risk of contracting gastrointestinal ailments, ear infections, upper respiratory infections and skin rashes, and can also harm fish and wildlife.
610	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	The biggest surprise in this year's report: the dramatic deterioration in water quality along the several-mile Long Beach coastline, which ranked worst in the state, said Mark Gold, president of Heal the Bay.
611	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of the 25 beaches tested there received grades of C through F -- 14 of them Ds and Fs -- leading the environmental group to lump the city's beaches into a single entity.
612	XIN_ENG_20070524.0346.LDC2009T13	"It's a very dramatic change, as Long Beach historically has had excellent water quality," Gold said.

615	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland held Serbia to a scoreless draw Saturday, seriously denting the home team's hopes of qualifying for the European Championships.
616	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Serbia attacked for most of the match but captain Dejan Stankovic and forward Danko Lazovic missed two clear chances in the first half.
617	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland's goalkeeper Jussi Jasskelainen also made a diving save to stop midfielder Bosko Jankovic's curling free kick in the 37th minute.
618	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland concentrated on defending and launching counter attacks.
619	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	In the 17th minute, forward Jonatan Johansson had a one-on-one situation against Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic, but failed to lob the fall into the net.
620	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Serbia lost its dominance in the second half, creating only one chance when Lazovic intercepted a poor backward pass in the 48th minute, but Jaaskelainen managed to control his poor shot.
621	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	Finland has 18 points from 10 matches in Group A, while Serbia has 15 from nine.
622	APW_ENG_20070908.0986.LDC2009T13	"Not everything is lost," said Serbia striker Nikola Zigic, who came on as a substitute in the second half.

629	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	Investment group Olivant said Monday it had withdrawn from the running to offer a rescue package for troubled British bank Northern Rock, shortly before the deadline expired for bids to be presented.
630	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	The withdrawal left a consortium led by Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson and a group from Northern Rock's own management as the only parties expected to make offers.
631	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	"Olivant ... has today decided not to submit a further proposal in relation to the stabilization, recapitalization and repositioning of Northern Rock plc," it said in a statement.
632	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	"Despite working intensively, we have been unable to formulate a value creation proposal which meets our investment criteria whilst also respecting (the British government's) proposed financing terms and the interests of other stakeholders in the company," added Olivant chairman Luqman Arnold.
633	AFP_ENG_20080204.0207.LDC2009T13	Last month, Britain's Labour government unveiled plans to keep Northern Rock in the private sector but admitted it could still be nationalised, having lent the bank about 25 billion pounds (33.4 billion euros, 49.4 billion dollars) in emergency funding to keep it afloat.

636	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	US envoy Christopher Hill will travel to Pyongyang later this week to try to revive flagging negotiations aimed at North Korea's nuclear disarmament, a State Department spokesman said Monday.
637	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Deputy spokesman Robert Wood said Hill's trip -- which includes stops in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo -- was part of effort "to get the process back on track."
638	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	He will leave later Monday for Seoul, where he is to due to hold talks Tuesday with South Korean counterpart Kim Sook, Wood said.
639	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	He will then travel to Pyongyang, though the exact date was not yet available.
640	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	"We're very concerned about some of the reversal of disablement activities that the North has been engaged in," Wood told reporters during the daily briefing in Washington.
641	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	"And he (Hill) obviously wants to consult with his counterparts in the region out there to see what our next steps are going to be with regard to a response to what the North is doing," Wood said.
642	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, will be "in the region looking for ways to work with our allies to bring North Korea into compliance with its obligations."
643	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	Under the six-country pact, North Korea agreed to disable and dismantle key nuclear facilities and allow UN atomic inspectors to return, in return for one million tonnes of fuel aid and its removal from a US list of terrorist states.
644	AFP_ENG_20080929.0272.LDC2009T13	But North Korea announced last month it had halted the process in protest at Washington's refusal to drop it from the US blacklist of countries supporting terrorism, as had been promised.

647	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	The French-Belgian bank Dexia, which specialises in financing local authorities, reported a 7.9-percent fall in net profit on Friday but said it had been little affected by the US home-loan subprime crisis.
648	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia, saying it could benefit from new conditions on troubled markets, reported a net profit of 2.533 billion euros (3.85 billion dollars).
649	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	This was more than the figure of 2.296 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Thomson Financial.
650	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Chief executive Axel Miller said: "The financial crisis has created a new environment from which only banks with an optimal level of liquidity, asset quality and capital will be able to draw benefit.
651	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	"In view of these results and events in 2007, Dexia is showing that it is one of these banks."
652	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia forecast average annual dividend growth of 10.0 percent and said it was recommending a 12.3-percent rise in the dividend for 2007 to 91 cents per share.
653	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Sales fell by 1.6 percent to 6.896 billion euros, which was slightly more than forecast by analysts.
654	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	But in the fourth quarter of the year, net profit fell by 25.3 percent to 587 million euros and sales by 10.0 percent to 1.695 billion euros.
655	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia said that the results demonstrated its financial strength and said: "The subprime mortgage crisis (in the United States) and in the financial sector has not had a significant impact on the quality of the group's assets."
656	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	It added that it had steered clear of the collateralised debt market at the root of the subprime crisis and that "the credit risk arising from subprime mortgage loans does not particularly worry Dexia."
657	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Many banks have had to write off billions of dollars from their assets because they were exposed through securitised debt to a collapse of the US subprime market.
658	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	However, Dexia said that some of its assets had lost value in connection with its subsidiary FSA involved in underwriting debt, and that its treasury activities and activity on financial markets had also had some setbacks.
659	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	For these asset reductions it gave a figure of 75 million euros in the fourth quarter, but said that this was a purely book- keeping figure because the assets remained fundamentally sound and would recover.
660	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Financial Security Assurance (FSA) had also announced on February 22 that it had written down its portfolio of assets by 418 million dollars.
661	AFP_ENG_20080229.0270.LDC2009T13	Dexia said that further writedowns might become necessary for the first quarter of this year.

665	APW_ENG_20080427.0817.LDC2009T13	Staal's goal came with older brother Marc, a Rangers defenseman on the ice, and was all the offensive support Fleury needed.

679	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Bitter political rivalries flared at independence celebrations in Mexico for a second year in a row.
680	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexico City's central plaza was the scene of competing celebrations on Saturday -- divided by metal fences and thousands of police officers, as the nation continues to struggle with last year's hotly contested presidential election.
685	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Ibarra is a political ally of leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who narrowly lost the July 2006 election to the conservative Calderon.
686	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador claims the election was tainted by fraud and has refused to accept Calderon's victory.
688	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Last September -- following two months of protests that snarled a main avenue in the capital to demand a recount -- then-President Vicente Fox avoided a confrontation by moving the ceremony hundreds of miles (kilometers) away to Dolores Hidalgo, where Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo made the first cry for independence from Spain in 1810.
689	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador said this year he would celebrate with followers in San Jose Tenango in southern Oaxaca state, one of the poorest municipalities in Mexico.
690	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	In Mexico City, factions staked out their turf in the Zocalo days ahead of time.
692	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, hundreds of vendors selling confetti and snacks crowded into the square, which was decorated with red, white and green lights -- the colors of the Mexican flag.
693	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexicans arriving for the nighttime celebration went through metal detectors and were received by blaring speakers on opposites sides of the plaza competing for their attention -- and making it impossible to hear.
694	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Calderon said no one should be left out of the Independence Day celebration, calling it an opportunity "for harmony and reconciliation."

699	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of Congress heard wrenching testimony on Monday from wounded soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and contrite promises from top Army officials to correct the conditions there.
700	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Two generals who had commanded Walter Reed, a premier military hospital in Washington, accepted responsibility for the situation faced by some wounded troops, including poor housing, neglect and a hopelessly complicated bureaucratic maze.
701	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said they were working to address the problems at Walter Reed and were examining the situation at other medical centers.
703	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were to testify.
704	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop for the hearing, the first of several that congressional committees intend to hold.
707	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi, causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
708	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient treatment, he recounted.
711	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
713	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start over several times.
715	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't fit for anybody to live in a room like that," Duncan said.
716	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Annette L. McLeod, whose husband, Wendell, returned from Iraq with a head injury, spoke emotionally of her distress during his treatment.
717	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"My life was ripped apart the day my husband was injured, and having to live through the mess we've had to live through at Walter Reed has been worse than anything I've had to sacrifice in my life," Annette McLeod said through tears.
718	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was "extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The Washington Post.
719	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His brother, Maj. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, a senior medical officer, has now been named to command Walter Reed.
720	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said extensive repairs were being made to deal with the deplorable conditions at one of the facilities on the hospital campus, Building 18, in which soldiers getting outpatient treatment at the hospital were found to be living in crumbling rooms soiled by mice, cockroaches and mold.
721	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Most of the soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.
722	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Allegations about shoddy treatment received by wounded soldiers at the prominent hospital, which is the centerpiece of the military's medical system, have touched a public nerve and deeply embarrassed the military in the past few weeks.
723	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has been thrown on the defensive, and members of Congress have been quick to express outrage.
724	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"This is absolutely the wrong way to treat our troops, and serious reforms need to happen immediately," said Rep. John F. Tierney, D-Mass., who is the chairman of the House oversight and government reform subcommittee on national security and foreign affairs.
725	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq."
726	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He warned of a coming crunch with President Bush's new plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.

729	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we send more and more troops into Iraq and Afghanistan, these problems are only going to get worse, not better," he said.
731	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated the White House's pledge to fix the problems at Walter Reed.
732	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.
733	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we work to improve conditions at Walter Reed, we want to find out whether similar problems have occurred at other military" and Veterans Administration hospitals, he said.
734	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"These brave men and women deserve the heartfelt thanks of our country, and they deserve the very best medical care that our government can possibly provide."
735	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news articles have hinted at similar problems for years.
736	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
737	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"You're not going to be able to Scotch tape over it," he said.
738	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
740	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
741	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He was pressed on Monday to explain how he had not known about the conditions at Building 18, even though he lived across the street from it.
743	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But the subcommittee members continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to civilians had left the hospital depleted.
744	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.
746	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Several patients at Walter Reed attended the hearing Monday and echoed some of the problems described.
747	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But Staff Sgt. Brian Beem, who lost his right leg to a makeshift bomb in Baghdad in October, said he had no idea conditions were so bad for some of his counterparts, even though he had heard grumbling.

824	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
825	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather, died of cancer in August 2006.
826	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was always going to be a difficult hurdle for me to get back into the winner's enclosure after Heather passed away... It's a big mental hurdle that I have crossed today," the 39-year-old said.
827	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as his thoughts drifted to his family.
828	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Italian Francesco Molinari, Taiwan's Lin Wen-tang and English rookie Robert Dinwiddie were tied for third place at five under in the 2.3-million-dollar tournament, which is co-sanctioned by the European and Asian tours.

831	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
832	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said it was the most important victory of his career as it cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.
833	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes there's a black hole.
834	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's not easy to see through," Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has endured since his wife died.
835	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	In that respect, Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons, aged nine and seven.
839	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"I've been working harder than I've ever worked on all aspects of my game.
840	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's nice to see it pay off," he said.
841	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke, the overnight leader, looked to be cruising to victory when he established a two-shot buffer over Derksen at the par three 14th hole after the Dutchman chipped into the water on his way to a double bogey.
845	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I started thinking about Heather and the boys and bits and pieces," Clarke said.
848	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	That left Clarke with his putt of nearly 30 feet to win the tournament or face going into a playoff with Derksen.

856	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2008-07-30 16:47:22 UTC
857	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa began cancelling the first international long-haul flights on Wednesday as ground and cabin crew continued their strike at Germany's biggest airline for a third day, the company said.
859	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The rest of the 82 flights canceled Wednesday were for destinations in Germany and Europe.
860	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Spokeswoman Amelie Lorenz said the canceled flights accounted for about 4 percent of the airline's total flight capacity.
861	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	She said affected passengers were being put on flights operated by other airlines.
862	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The airline said it had drawn up a special schedule for German and European routes for the next five days that calls for about 90 percent of flights to take off.
864	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said the cost of the strike was not yet clear.
865	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"There are not yet measurable effects of possible further strike actions and cost burdens from the ongoing negotiations," Mayrhuber said, speaking at the company's release of second- quarter earnings Wednesday.
866	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Stephan Gemkow was brief but frank on the subject, admitting: "It's expensive."
867	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The ver.di union, which represents about 50,000 ground service personnel and a small number of cabin staff, started an open- ended strike for more pay Monday.
868	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The first day of strikes had little effect on the Cologne-based airline's flights, but approximately 70 flights were canceled Tuesday.
869	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The union is seeking a 9.8 percent pay rise for a year, while the airline has offered 7.7 percent for 21 months including a one- time bonus payment.
870	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Gemkow said the union and airline were not in discussions currently.
871	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The union isn't ready to talk to us at the moment," he said.
872	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	A top official with the Federation of German Industries urged ver.di to "show moderation and return to the negotiating table."
873	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The strike is damaging air transport, tourism, logistics and the whole economy -- and that in a phase in which economic signals are in any case pointing downward," Werner Schnappauf said in a statement.
874	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Harald Walter, a ver.di spokesman, said the union was compiling a cost estimate of what Lufthansa could be encountering through the strikes.
875	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	He said that, for instance, both Lufthansa Technik, the company's aircraft maintenance and repair business, and catering unit LSG SkyChefs usually do a lot of work for airlines other than Lufthansa, but that extra revenue was not coming in from outside customers during the strike.
876	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa Cargo spokesman Nils Haupt said cargo operations also were affected and freight to many German and European destinations was being transported by truck instead of by air.
877	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Haupt said the cargo division was doing its best to compensate for the strike by using different internal personnel, including some from outside Germany, as well as other service companies.
878	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Lufthansa shares closed down nearly 1.5 percent at euro14.88 (US$23.36) in Frankfurt.

901	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	New York has been the site of Federer's three consecutive U.S. Open triumphs, and the two-week event has also given Federer a platform to meet and befriend luminaries.
902	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Anna Wintour and Tiger Woods are now only a phone call away.
903	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour, the editor of Vogue, was even closer Thursday night.
904	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour threw Federer a dinner party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and invited 60 guests, including the designers Diane von Furstenberg, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta.
905	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"That was great fun," Federer said Friday in a public garden atop Niketown, before speaking to children from the City Parks tennis program.
907	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Thursday's dinner, in honor of his recent appearance on the cover of Men's Vogue, had been postponed since March when Wintour told him to rest for the French Open.
908	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I know Anna very well," Federer said.
909	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"And then meeting the designers -- these people are a big inspiration.
910	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	I've gotten into fashion the last few years, done my own fashion statements on center court at Wimbledon."
911	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer wore a white blazer with the "RF" crest at Wimbledon, where he has won five straight titles.
913	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I think she's also excited about this outfit at the Open."
916	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	In July, Federer tied Bjorn Borg's record of five straight Wimbledon titles.
917	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It would be nice to win four in a row, but basically I'm here to defend my title for last year," Federer said.
918	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Wimbledon was great because it was five in a row.
919	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	That was for me a really big streak."
920	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	The victory at Wimbledon gave him his 11th major title.
921	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	A month later, Woods won his 13th major title, at the PGA Championship, stoking their friendly competition to catch their sports' career leaders (Pete Sampras's 14 major titles and Jack Nicklaus's 18).
922	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Last September, Woods was in Federer's box to watch him win the U.S. Open final against Andy Roddick.
923	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Only afterward did Woods and Federer meet for the first time.
924	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I had met many sports greats, but Tiger was a logical thing because we were always talking about each other," Federer said.
925	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Now they frequently talk or text-message each other.
926	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	(Federer said he did not think that Woods, a new father, would be coming to the Open this year.)
927	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	They have seen each other play when their tournament schedules overlap, in Shanghai, Miami and Dubai, where their Gillette advertising campaign was announced in February.
928	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Watching Woods play made him feel even more of a kinship.
929	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"He does things a little bit similar to me," Federer said.
930	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Like on the golf course, you think he's serious, so focused, concentrated guy.
931	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	But then you get little hints of actually what personality he has off the golf course.
932	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	When he gets a bit angry or laughs or does a joke with other golfers.
933	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Off the court, he's so laid back, it's unbelievable."
934	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer, 26, from Basel, Switzerland, is also laid-back.
935	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He travels with a small entourage led by his longtime girlfriend, Mirka Vavrinec, who arranges his schedule in minute detail leading up to the Open.
936	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Even though he has had daily practices since arriving Tuesday, Federer said he was grateful for some down time in New York after a grueling last few weeks in North America.
937	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer lost in a final for only the third time this season, in Montreal against 20 -year-old Novak Djokovic of Serbia, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 7-6 (2).
938	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer's only other losses in finals came on clay against Rafael Nadal: at Monte Carlo and at the French Open, the one major Federer has not won.
939	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer avenged that loss at Wimbledon in a five-set thriller.
940	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It's good sometimes to lose," said Federer, who followed the loss in Montreal by defeating James Blake for the title in Cincinnati last week.
941	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"You start new.
942	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Like last week, people talk, people think.
943	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	One week later, you've won and everything is OK again.
944	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	There was nothing to be worried about."
946	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	BOSNIA BIGGER WORRY THAN KOSOVO
949	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Kosovo will likely declare independence from Serbia in the next few months.
950	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If it does, the United States and most members of the European Union will recognize Kosovo, but will insist upon the establishment of an international mission similar to the United Nations Office of the High Representative in Bosnia to ensure the new state's stability.
951	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Serbia and its patron Russia will strongly oppose any move towards independence by Kosovo, but what form that opposition will take is uncertain.
953	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Doing so would almost certainly lead to a direct confrontation with the United States and European Union.
954	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Neither Serbia nor Russia wants that.
955	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Despite the tensions surrounding Kosovo's independence, a full- scale conflict is unlikely.
956	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	And despite the sentiment in some quarters for Kosovo remaining an autonomous province of Serbia, the prospects of that occurring are close to zero.
957	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	An independent Kosovo will be a weak state for many years to come, but it will not be (or allowed to be) a threat to the region.
958	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the political future of Bosnia is murky.
959	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	For almost two years, Bosnian politicians have quarreled, often quite bitterly, about the constitutional future of the country.
960	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian Serbs and to a lesser degree the Bosnian Croats, both minorities in relation to the Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks), have sought to consolidate their political status under Annex 4 (the constitution) of the Dayton Agreement.
961	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	For the Serbs, now lead by the powerful RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, the goal is preservation of their entity and a weak central government.
962	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosniaks, on the other hand, under the leadership of Haris Silajdzic, have pushed for a strong central government.
963	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The international community has tried without much success to navigate these opposing positions.
964	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	A set of amendments to the constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament.
966	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of national legislation easier.
967	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	These reforms essentially challenged the practice of elected representatives and government ministers of absenting themselves from key votes.
969	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	They provoked a crisis by demanding that the High Representative rescind his measures.
970	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	With support from Serbia and Russia, RS Prime Minister Dodik threatened the secession of the Serb entity.
971	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
972	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains unresolved.
973	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The political situation is now fraught with uncertainty for a number of reasons.
974	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	First, the international community is anxious to end the U.N.'s Dayton mission and turn the reform effort over to the EU.
976	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	However, the events of the past six months have clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to go it alone.
979	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Bosnia is at a precipice.
980	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If the international community commits itself to finishing the job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a constitutional government capable of serving all the people of Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future of the country will brighten considerably.
981	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If, however, the international community turns its back on Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next year.
982	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In view of the enormous investment that the international community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.

986	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
988	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The video, apparently shot by sailors based at a naval base in California, has caused one sailor to be "counseled" and the ship's captain to be called to the Pentagon to review security procedures, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
990	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Titled "Women of CVN 76: 'That Don't Impress Me Much'," the four- minute clip had been viewed 31,000 times before it was pulled off the popular website, apparently by the person who posted it.
991	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	CVN 76 is the Navy's call-sign for the aircraft carrier, which is longer than the height of the Empire State Building and home to 5,500 sailors.
993	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Charlie Brown said the Navy was concerned that the video producers exercised a "lack of propriety" in a few scenes involving sailors dancing and lip- synching with safety equipment.
994	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	One of the scenes showed a sailor dancing to the ditty dressed in a full-body radiation suit, and also showed the doors to the Reagan's nuclear power plant.
995	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The video also included a cameo appearance by ship captain Terry Kraft.
996	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Navy regulations strictly forbid the dissemination of photos of anything related to the ship's nuclear propulsion gear.
997	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Brown said the ship's captain was summoned to a Pentagon meeting about the video, and the sailor who produced the video was counseled.
998	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	According to the report, the sailor who posted the video was not identified, but his YouTube page also features videos of Naval aviators based in California's Ventura County that frequently are stationed on board the Reagan.

1022	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's tremendous," said Warren J. Nokleberg, a senior research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. "It lets students and scientists better appreciate the mobile Earth, to see where it's going.
1023	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	That's very powerful."
1024	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Practitioners acknowledge that their predictions, however intriguing, become more theoretical when pushed far into the future, as with advanced weather forecasts.
1025	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their most ambitious efforts peer 250 million years ahead.
1028	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	One Web site has received almost 30 million hits since its debut in 1998, and the field's admirers now include top scientists.
1030	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It captures the attention."
1031	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Press features one of the forecasts in his introductory college text, "Understanding Earth" (Freeman, 2006).
1032	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He and three co- authors present a snapshot of how the planet's surface might look 50 million years from now, calling it "a plausible scenario."
1033	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the snapshot shows that Africa has drifted to the north, plowing into Europe and fusing the two landmasses, eliminating the Mediterranean Sea and replacing it with the Mediterranean Mountains.
1034	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The rugged range runs down the middle of a continent far bigger than current-day Eurasia, a giant new agglomeration that might be called Afrasia.
1035	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	While peering 50 million years into the future may seem like a stretch, geologists consider such spans of time the blink of an eye.
1037	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"Fifty million is fairly straightforward," said Christopher R. Scotese, a geologist at the University of Texas, Arlington, who has pioneered the predictions in recent years.

1039	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's like you're driving on the highway and you want to know where you're going to be in 10 minutes.
1040	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	You check the speedometer, do a calculation, and project your present motion.
1041	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But beyond 50 million years," Scotese added, "like on the highway, unexpected things can happen."
1044	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over ages, hot convection currents in this sea, as well as gravitational forces, move the plates and their superimposed continents and ocean basins, tearing them apart and rearranging them like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.
1045	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory, named for the Greek word "tekton," or builder, is a study in slowness.
1047	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, geologists measure such changes with great precision thanks to the advent of global positioning satellites and small base stations that dot remote areas of the planet and operate unattended.
1049	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	From the start of the theory's acceptance, geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past and to render it in credible reconstructions.
1051	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1970, Robert S. Dietz, who uncovered major clues to plate movement in the deep sea, wrote a Scientific American article on the breakup of Pangea.
1052	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
1053	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Dietz zeroed in on the San Andreas fault, the deep gash beneath California that spawned the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- one among many -- and today also threatens the Los Angeles area.
1054	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The fault marks the seam where the Pacific plate slides relentlessly northward past the North American plate.
1055	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
1056	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And in another 50 million years, he added, Los Angeles will have moved up the west coast into Alaskan waters.
1057	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Such visualizations caught the eye of Scotese in the late 1970s when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
1058	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He loved the challenge of the big picture, and of using his computer programs, new to such work, to speed the endless drawing and redrawing.
1059	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	With his graduate adviser, he made detailed maps showing the past evolution of the continents.
1060	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And he toyed with their future shapes.
1062	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
1064	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	he recalled.
1065	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But being a rash graduate student in need of extra change, I decided to give it a try."
1066	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
1067	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Scotese drew a series of futuristic maps and, in the 1990s, found an ideal way to communicate his increasingly detailed visions of the terrestrial past and future: over the Internet.
1068	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, Scotese's Web site, www.scotese.com, which he started in 1998, showcases his work, called the Paleomap Project.
1069	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Teachers use his animations, and his site has won scientific awards.
1070	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	(He aids the publishing world, too, providing Press and his co-authors with their map of the future world.)
1071	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, some of his most ambitious efforts center on envisioning how Earth might look 250 million years from now.
1072	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The easy part, Scotese said, is the continents.
1073	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their masses might change shape but seldom disappear altogether because their bedrock weighs little compared with dense ocean crust.
1074	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Continents literally float above the action.
1075	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	So do mountains.
1076	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Once formed, they tend to persist, disappearing only after ages of erosion wear them down.
1077	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The difficult part, he said, is predicting the development of new subduction zones in the seabed, and in comprehending how aggressively they rearrange the land.
1080	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It probably has some say on which way the plates go."
1084	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Then -- 25 million to 75 million years from now -- Australia moves north, slamming into Indonesia and Malaysia before pirouetting counterclockwise to smash into the Philippines and then Asia, eventually merging with it.
1085	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Antarctica also moves north, shedding its icecap.
1087	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The Indian Ocean becomes a virtual inland sea.
1089	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some 200 million years from now, the closure forces Newfoundland to smash into Africa and, a bit later, Brazil to ram into South Africa.
1090	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The collisions gain force
1091	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	250 million years from now, the continents will have merged into a new supercontinent that encircles what remains of the Indian Ocean.
1093	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In looking for a name, "I tried Bagelea or Donutea but figured that would trivialize the whole experience.
1094	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A friend suggested Pangea Ultima -- classy, like a fancy car.
1095	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It implies that it's the last Pangea, which certainly isn't true, but it's the last one I'm going to come up with."
1097	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
1098	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	As Scotese envisioned, they can break apart and reverse course to merge again.
1099	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.

1102	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
1104	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Sergei A. Pisarevsky, a geologist at the Tectonics Special Research Center of the University of Western Australia, calls the resulting supercontinent "Amasia."
1105	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But he said his vision bore no special likelihood of coming true.
1106	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"My guess," he said, "is that the Pacific should disappear."
1107	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	J. Brendan Murphy, a specialist on tectonic cycles at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, echoed that view.
1108	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists, he said, know too little about the causes of plate motion to predict the dance of continents into the far future.
1109	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But in the next few decades, he added, progress in geology is likely to lay bare Earth's inner workings and enhance the art of plate forecasting.
1110	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Even with today's efforts, Murphy said, "all the coughing stops in class when I show a projection.
1111	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It's a very interesting way to look at the world."
1112	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing to realize," he said, "is that modern geology is just a snapshot of a continuous-action movie.
1113	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	When you zoom out and look over a long enough time, you realize everything is mobile."

1135	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Asked how they will respond if the party leadership decides to summon them to run in "tough electoral zones" where the odds are against DPP candidates, at least four of the "11 nemeses" within the DPP reacted with indifference or made sarcastic remarks.
1137	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said the party should summon DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung to run in a tough district because of his "high caliber, competence and consistent political correctness."
1138	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng had lambasted Lin a week earlier for calling former New Tide faction members defeated in the primary "opportunists."

1193	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Second-quarter earnings at International Business Machines Corp. rose 12 percent and beat Wall Street forecasts Wednesday, largely on the strength of IBM's software division and improvement in its services unit.
1194	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	From April through June, the Armonk, New York-based technology bellwether earned $2.26 billion (euro1.64 billion), $1.55 (euro1.12) per share, on revenue of $23.8 billion (euro17.27 billion).
1195	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the comparable period last year, IBM earned $2.02 billion (euro1.47 billion), $1.30 (euro.94) per share, on revenue of $21.9 billion (euro15.89 billion).
1196	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	This year's quarterly numbers were boosted $81 million (euro58.79 million), or 5 cents per share, from the sale of IBM's printing division to Ricoh Co.
1197	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Without that gain, IBM would have earned $1.50 (euro1.09) per share, beating the estimate of $1.47 (euro1.07) expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
1198	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Analysts were expecting revenue of $23.1 billion (euro16.76 billion).
1199	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's overall sales growth of 9 percent in the second quarter would have been 6 percent if not for weakness in the dollar.

1202	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The company's overall profit margins also increased slightly.
1203	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's shares surged to multiyear highs this week after some analysts predicted IBM would exceed Wall Street's forecast.
1206	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	One common gauge of IBM's health is services contract signings, because it foretells huge chunks of revenue that will be booked in future quarters.
1208	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Revenue actually booked in the second quarter rose 10 percent to $13.1 billion (euro9.51 billion).
1209	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's hardware division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $5.1 billion (euro3.7 billion), though it would have been flat if not for currency fluctuations.
1211	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	That has prompted the company to make dozens of acquisitions to bolster its security and business- management offerings, including this week's $161 million (euro116.84 million) deal for DataMirror Corp.
1212	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM software revenue grew 13 percent to $4.8 billion (euro3.48 billion) in the second quarter, and pre-tax profit was $1.25 billion (euro0.91 billion), just slightly less than what the much bigger services arm generated.
1214	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the first six months of the year, IBM earned $4.11 billion (euro2.98 billion), $2.75 (euro2) per share, with revenue of $45.8 billion (euro33.24 billion).

1229	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	The United States raised doubts about whether Iranians had a "full menu of political choices" in Friday's parliamentary elections, but declined to pronounce them unfair.
1230	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"I don't know anything about turnout," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters when asked to comment on the elections and voter turnout.
1231	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"One thing I'd note though is the fact that the government had a heavy hand in deciding who could and could not run raises some questions about whether or not the Iranian people had a full menu of political choices available to them in this election," McCormack said.
1232	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	"Then again that is not something that is new.
1233	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	There have been plenty of past instances in Iran where the government has summarily scratched names of potential candidates off the list, telling them they couldn't run for office."
1234	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Ahead of the vote, Iranian reformists have expressed fury that hundreds of their candidates were disqualified in vetting for the polls while conservatives have accused leading moderates of being too close to the West.
1235	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Asked whether he could rule out any chance that the elections would be fair, McCormack replied: "I guess we'll have to wait for input from my other colleagues before I have something more to stay about it."
1236	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday the administration had "very low expectations" for the elections, saying the results were unlikely to reflect the people's will.

1238	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Iran's leadership has been keen to minimize political divisions and make a show of national unity amid the tensions over the Iranian atomic drive, which Washington charges is an unacknowledged effort to develop nuclear weapons.
1239	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	Last week the UN Security Council tightened sanctions against Tehran over its refusal to heed the world body's calls to freeze uranium enrichment, a potential weapons-making process.

1241	AFP_ENG_20080314.0244.LDC2009T13	State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey appeared to say as much last week, though he did not actually mention the elections.

1246	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Art theft specialists from Bavaria's criminal investigations office estimate that the collection, which includes around 1,100 masks, necklaces and statues, is worth about US$100 million (euro64 million), said Ludwig Waldinger, a spokesman for the office.
1247	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger said that Costa Rican authorities appealed to Germany and Interpol last week to help find a collection that they contend was removed from the country illegally by a 66-year-old art collector named Leonardo Augustus Patterson.
1248	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Patterson, a former diplomat from Costa Rica, claims to have proper ownership of the artifacts, investigators said.
1250	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger said that Patterson recently arranged for the collection to be shipped from Costa Rica to Europe.
1251	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	After clearing customs in Spain, the artifacts were loaded onto a caravan of semitrailers and driven to Munich.
1252	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Bavarian authorities found the collection packed in more than 100 wooden crates at an undisclosed location in Munich in southern Germany.
1253	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	They also found Patterson, who has been questioned by investigators but is not in police custody, said Waldinger.
1254	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	He could face criminal charges if it is determined that he is not the collection's rightful owner, Waldinger said.
1255	APW_ENG_20080430.0993.LDC2009T13	Waldinger added that authorities want to unpack and catalog the art, but need to coordinate that effort with archaeologists and Latin American officials -- a process that could take up to a month.

1257	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The International Monetary Fund announced plans Friday to cut up to 15 percent of its staff in a wide-ranging overhaul aimed at shoring up finances at the multilateral economic institution.
1258	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In comments posted in an internal IMF magazine, the organization said the planned overhaul aimed at budget savings of around 100 million dollars annually and possible job losses of between 300 and 400 staff.
1259	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Such cuts could affect around 15 percent of the IMF's total headcount of 2,600.
1260	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	An IMF official, who requested anonymity, told AFP the job cuts would likely occur over three years starting on May 1, 2008.
1262	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Prior job cuts have been small by comparison involving considerably less than 100 employees.
1263	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister who took over the helm of the IMF in early November, said the fund does not face an immediate financing crisis, but that it cannot continue to rely on income from lending to guarantee its future.
1265	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Without quickly reforming its operations and cutting jobs, the IMF could face a funding shortfall of 400 million dollars by 2010, the magazine article, which was posted on the IMF's website, warned.

1271	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The overhaul comes as the IMF faces challenges over its survival.
1272	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Many developing nations are growing rapidly and as a result have less need for IMF aid which is often granted with strict standards.

1285	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"There is an indication that the overall quarter might turn out to be better than expected," said David Dropsey, a research analyst with Thomson Financial that tracks equities.

1292	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That matches the historical averages, Dropsey said.
1293	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Of the 31 companies, those that have beaten expectations have done so by an average of 8 percent.

1301	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	P 500 during the third quarter, it is still expected to blow past the historical average of 7.6 percent.

1320	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	A French court ruled Thursday in favor of a satirical weekly newspaper that faced charges brought by two Muslim groups after it published cartoons featuring the Prophet Muhammad that had caused an international uproar when a Danish newspaper published most of them.
1321	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The charges, brought by the Paris Mosque and the Union of Islamic Organizations of France, accused the newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, and its editor, Philippe Val, of "publicly abusing a group of people because of their religion."
1322	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The charges could have resulted in a six-month prison term for Val and a fine of about $29,000 against the newspaper.

1325	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Charlie Hebdo published the cartoons in solidarity with the Danish newspaper and to make a point about freedom of expression in France, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe.
1326	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	On the cover of its Feb. 8, 2006, issue, Charlie Hebdo published an original drawing by the French cartoonist Cabu depicting a crying Muhammad with his head in his hands, saying, "It's hard to be loved by idiots."
1328	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	While France has limits on public expression, particularly with regard to racist speech, enforcement varies according to the national mood and penalties for infractions are usually low.
1329	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	The court acknowledged that one of the cartoons, which depicted Muhammad wearing a turban shaped like a bomb, might offend some Muslims.
1330	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	But it said that, given the context of its publication, it saw no "deliberate intention of directly and gratuitously offending the Muslim community."
1331	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Last September, a Danish court rejected a similar lawsuit against Jyllands-Posten.
1332	NYT_ENG_20070322.0112.LDC2009T13	Val called the ruling a victory for freedom of speech and secular French Muslims.

1369	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	LONDON 2008-10-17 16:46:33 UTC
1370	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	European markets rose strongly Friday as a recovery in the price of oil helped oil stocks, but Wall Street was down after further grim U.S. economic news.
1371	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 201.62 points, or 5.2 percent, higher at 4,063.01, while Germany's DAX was up 158.52 points, or 3.4 percent, at 4,781.33.
1372	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	France's CAC-40 was up 148.92 points, or 4.7 percent, at 3,329.92.
1373	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Europe's indexes were higher through the day in the wake of the Dow's strong performance Thursday and the recovery on Japan's Nikkei.
1374	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	On Friday, the Dow Jones index underperformed Europe's indexes, trading 46.28 points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 8,932.98 after further evidence emerged that the U.S. is heading for a deep and protracted recession.
1375	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell more than 6 percent in September to an annual rate of 817,000 units, a near 18-year low, while and the University of Michigan said its U.S. consumer confidence index slumped to 57.5 in October from 70.3 the previous month.
1376	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"The drop back in U.S. consumer confidence in October suggests that the meltdown in the financial markets, rising unemployment and the continued weakness in housing more than offset any positive boost from lower gasoline prices," said Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
1377	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It's been an erratic week on Wall Street, with the Dow soaring 936 points on Monday, slipping moderately Tuesday, sinking 733 points Wednesday, and then rallying 401 points Thursday.
1378	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The volatility is not providing investors with much relief, but it is a welcome change from last week's seemingly relentless plunge, during which the Dow logged its worst week ever and Wall Street lost about $2.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.
1379	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The long-term key to the health of financial markets is whether the flurry of activity by governments over the last week or so can actually break the logjam in credit markets.
1380	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	There are growing signs the coordinated interest rate reductions announced last week, and massive liquidity boosts by central banks, are beginning to reduce lending rates between banks.
1381	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The interbank lending rate for three-month dollar loans fell for the fifth day running, the first weekly decline in three months.
1382	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It dropped 0.08 percent to 4.42 percent, while the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, fell almost 0.045 percentage points to 5.045 percent.
1383	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rates are falling, the differential between the rate at which banks lend to each other and official central bank lending rates remain high, signalling a strong degree of mistrust still exists.
1385	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"Even if the financial maelstrom may be about to abate it is not over," said Russell Jones, global head of fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
1386	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	"A serious global recession is 'baked in the cake' and this is bound to mean that there will be further pulses of risk aversion, further traumas for financial sectors and markets and acute pain both for corporate sectors and for individuals," he added.
1387	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rescue packages have helped alleviate the pressures on the banking system, threats in the financial system remain, from credit default swaps -- which insure against defaults on securities -- from the insurance sector and from emerging markets.
1388	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Following the bailout of the banks, investor concerns have moved onto the insurance sector.
1389	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Dutch bank and insurer ING Groep NV was the latest to suffer in the stock markets Friday on media reports that the company is in need of cash.
1390	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Its shares were down 19 percent at euro8.20 (US$10.98).
1391	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Concerns about the global economic outlook have taken their toll on oil prices in recent days, which fell Thursday to near 14-month lows below US$70 before recovering US$1.92 Friday to US$71.77.
1392	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Friday's modest recovery in the oil price helped some stocks in Europe recover ground, notably BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell on the FTSE, which both rose 8 percent.
1393	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Both had suffered major drops Thursday when oil prices dropped steeply.
1394	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Despite Friday's rise, oil prices are half what they were just three months ago and that is weighing on countries dependent on oil exports, such as Russia.
1395	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Its indexes continued their losing streak on Friday, with the MICEX dropping 4.3 percent and the RTS down 6.48 percent.
1396	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock average advanced 235.27 points, or 2.78 percent, at 8,693.82.
1397	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The index was still far from recouping Thursday's 11.4 percent loss -- its biggest one-day percentage drop since the stock market crash of October 1987.
1398	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	For the week, the Nikkei gained 5 percent, much better than the 24 percent it lost last week.

1410	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	BALI, Indonesia, Dec. 11 (Xinhua)
1411	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
1412	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Contact groups and informal consultations continued Tuesday as United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon joined the discussions here on Tuesday morning to add to voices for global actions on climate change.
1413	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference is the need for quantified national emission targets for industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the next 10-15 years.
1415	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
1416	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
1417	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted by enthusiastic applause.
1418	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	In a daily press briefing on Tuesday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer hailed the agreement as "encouraging".
1419	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed on Monday how the Adaptation Fund will operate, including its governing body, functions, secretariat, trustee and other institutional arrangements.
1420	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an interim arrangement up for review every three years was a surprise to me," says one observer.
1421	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"I think most of us are delighted to have finalized the Fund whether you like the precise details or not," adds another.
1422	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with regard to developing countries.
1423	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
1424	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
1425	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to.
1426	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
1427	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will deliver a statement at the opening of the High-Level segment on Wednesday and the segment is due to end on Friday.
1428	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	During these last three days of the conference, Environment Ministers will seek to reach agreement on the shape of a future international climate pact, the so- called " Bali roadmap".

1431	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	A nonprofit group has started briefing departments and agencies on the importance of properly "onboarding" new employees, after releasing a report showing that the government and new employees could benefit from well-run orientations.
1432	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
1433	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.
1434	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	Studies of private-sector employers, plus anecdotal evidence from agencies, show that good onboarding programs improve retention and get new workers up to full performance levels sooner, said Max Stier, president of the Partnership.
1436	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The report, produced in conjunction with the Booz Allen Hamilton consulting firm, recommends that new employees be assigned a sponsor who can help integrate them into the organization, and that senior leadership, managers and supervisors become personally involved in the transition and not leave the task to the human resources office.

1440	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgia's former defense minister was freed on a multimillion- dollar bail early Tuesday after retracting his accusations against the president and left the country, news reports said.
1441	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Irakly Okruashvili was arrested Sept. 27, the day after he accused President Mikhail Saakashvili of a murder plot and corruption -- allegations Saakashvili dismissed as "unpardonable lies."
1442	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was charged with extortion, money-laundering and abuse of power.
1443	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Nika Gvaramia, Georgia's deputy chief prosecutor, said Okruashvili had retracted his accusations and admitted he made them for political purposes.
1444	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Gvaramia also said that Okruashvili had pleaded guilty to charges of extortion and failure to properly perform his duties.
1445	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Georgian television stations on Monday broadcast footage of the questioning in which Okruashvili retracted his accusations.
1446	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili, wearing a track suit, looked tense and tired but spoke clearly.
1447	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	A court in the capital, Tbilisi, ruled Monday to free Okruashvili on bail equivalent to US$6 million (euro4.3 million).
1448	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was freed overnight after he produced the money and was escorted home by police.
1449	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	He refused to answer reporters' questions.
1450	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Later Tuesday, the Georgian Pirveli news agency quoted Okruashvili's bodyguards as saying he had left the country with his family.
1451	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Prosecutor Keti Chomakhishvili who was in charge of Okruashvili's case couldn't confirm that he went abroad, but said it could be part of an arrangement with authorities.
1452	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was a longtime Saakashvili ally who served as his defense minister until late last year.

1457	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	The militant al-Qaida group announced Thursday the imminent arrival of a new video message from American-born Islamist Adam Gadahn, making it the first message from the organization in 2008.
1458	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	"Coming soon by the will of God, an invitation to reflection and repentance," read the banner produced by al-Sahab, al-Qaida's media wing, and displayed on a militant Web site.

1465	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
1466	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax returns released by the campaign late Friday.
1467	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Former President Clinton has collected a whopping $51.9 million in appearance fees since leaving office in Jan. 2001 -- averaging about $150,000 per speech.
1468	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	He's also raked in $29.6 million from his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned tepid reviews.
1469	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
1470	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The documents released Friday illustrate a remarkable financial turnaround, thanks to speaking fees, lucrative book contracts and deals with a pair of businessmen who have paid more than $15 million to the former president.
1471	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who released his tax returns months ago, has often taunted Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for refusing to release hers earlier, suggesting she wasn't committed to transparency.
1472	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one- page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the past three years).
1473	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
1474	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her 2002 autobiography "Living History."
1475	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
1477	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to various accounts.
1478	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	John Kerry is the richest senator with a net worth estimated at $211 million.
1479	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about $3.9 million from 2000 to 2007.
1480	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
1481	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
1482	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
1483	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.

1495	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Plague could break out in quake-hit areas if victims' bodies were not buried soon, a local official told Xinhua on Thursday.
1496	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Many bodies are trapped in debris and heavy-lifting gear cannot get through blocked roads to the disaster areas, said Bai Licheng, a senior Communist Party official of the Aba prefecture in Sichuan Province.
1497	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Since the destructive earthquake on Monday, Bai has been searching for survivors with a rescue team in Yingxiu of Wenchuan County, epicenter of the quake.
1498	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	High temperatures would quicken the rotting of bodies, and plague would break out, he warned.
1503	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	On Thursday afternoon, Gao Qiang, deputy health minister, vowed that the central government aims to prevent the outbreak of large-scale epidemic.
1504	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said the bodies of the dead would be handled properly as soon as possible to prevent harmful bacteria from growing.
1505	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We should not add to the losses caused by natural disasters and let people suffer more just because we have not done our job well," said Gao.

1523	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	His comments came two days after the Los Angeles archdiocese agreed to a record 660 million dollar (480 million euro) payout to 508 people who were sexually abused by priests in cases dating back to the 1940s.
1524	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The case has dominated headlines in Spain this week.
1526	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	Spain has passed from being a bastion of Roman Catholicism to a predominantly secular society in less than a generation.
1527	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	While 80 percent of Spaniards call themselves Catholics only one in five go to mass, according to a study published last year.
1528	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The Church meanwhile feels under siege from the Socialist government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which has legalised gay marriage and taken steps to loosen the ties between church and state since coming to power in 2004.

1530	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Children's Cold Remedies Raised Questions for Years
1531	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
1532	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a pediatrician and father of two young boys.
1533	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Kids with colds were getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either effective or safe."
1534	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
1536	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
1538	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
1539	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
1540	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
1541	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to children that have never been tested in children," Michael Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
1542	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
1543	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group.
1547	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
1548	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
1549	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
1550	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The over-the-counter drug review was never made a priority in the agency, and so it dragged on for years and years."
1551	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
1552	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
1553	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
1554	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"At that point in time, it was felt that was the best level of evidence we could have," said Marsha Rappley, a professor of pediatrics at Michigan State University who co-chaired last week's panel.
1555	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"We now understand that we can organize studies in children and don't have to extrapolate from adults.
1556	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But that wasn't the case back then."
1557	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were made for children and the products never again received any kind of detailed scrutiny.
1559	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Journal of the American Medical Association published an analysis in 1993 that concluded there was no good evidence the medications worked.
1561	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
1563	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	If you are a desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and your kid has a cold what do you do?
1564	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
1565	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The American Academy of Pediatrics adopted a policy in 1997 stating cough products were ineffective, and the American College of Chest Physicians produced a similar statement in 2006.
1568	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
1569	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Some experts defend the medical groups, saying policy statements from doctor groups can only do so much, especially against the aggressive marketing by large pharmaceutical companies, which spend more than $50 million a year to sell the products.
1570	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"For the past 25 or 30 years we've been warning about violence on TV," said Snodgrass, who also chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on drugs.
1571	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"What has that done?
1573	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The American Academy of Pediatrics is not a multibillion-dollar industry.
1574	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	We try to do what we can, but there's only so much we can do.
1576	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
1579	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
1584	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
1585	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
1587	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers to organize studies of the products.
1588	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The industry has voluntarily withdrawn products designed for children younger than 2, but it maintains that the remedies are both safe and effective for older children when used properly, blaming the problems primarily on overdoses.
1593	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday said he felt "very troubled" at learning that the perpetrator of the deadliest school shooting in US history was believed to be a fellow South Korean national.
1594	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"On this tragic accident, I feel very much sorry and troubled," Ban, a former foreign minister of South Korea, told reporters when asked for his reaction.
1595	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"Any such rampant killing of innocent citizens and children is totally not acceptable," he said.
1596	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"I condemn it in the strongest terms possible."

1604	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His departure gives Democrats a better chance to protect or even expand their one- seat majority in the U.S. Senate.
1605	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, became a respected voice on the Iraq war because of his cautious views and loyalty to President George W. Bush, as well as his expertise on national security issues.
1607	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	His remarks roiled the White House, and Bush administration officials asked him to clarify that he had not broken politically with the president.
1608	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner stood by his comments.
1609	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	Warner, a courtly senator with chiseled features and a full shock of gray hair, chose a sentimental setting for his announcement: the steps of the University of Virginia's signature structure, the Rotunda, designed by school founder Thomas Jefferson.
1611	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	The Republican Party nominated Warner for the Senate in 1978 and Warner was elected by the razor-thin margin of 4,721 votes out of 1.2 million cast.

1613	APW_ENG_20070831.1410.LDC2009T13	"Public service is a privilege and I urge all to try to find time some time in their lifetime to serve the needs of others," Warner said Friday.

1651	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The case is unusual because it went to court, but the violence is not.
1653	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Far softer than a 2004 law that banned Muslim head scarves and other "ostentatious" religious signs from public classrooms, the proposed charter is, like the head scarf law, an effort to ensure the secular nature of France.
1654	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Tensions over religious beliefs in French hospitals, prisons and elsewhere have mounted in recent years, particularly as Muslim fundamentalists find a voice.
1656	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Plans to draw the line on what is considered unacceptable behavior in hospitals, carrying risks for patients, were first raised three years ago during the debate over Muslim head scarves.
1657	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Then-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that hospitals were the next target.
1659	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	It submitted its proposal for a charter on Monday.
1660	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Male doctors, particularly in maternity wards, say they are increasingly subject to insults, even blows, most often by men opposed to nudity or physical contact with their wives and daughters.
1661	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The conviction last week of Fouhad Ben Moussa highlighted the issue.
1662	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	He pulled Jean-Francois Oury, the head of the maternity ward of Robert Debre Hospital in Paris, from a hospital room in September and slapped him after the doctor manually examined his wife, who had hemorrhaged after giving birth, according to court testimony.
1663	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	"In my religion, a man doesn't touch a woman," Ben Moussa screamed, according to the testimony.
1665	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	Still, he was sentenced to a six-month jail term which can be served in part at home.
1666	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	"I think the Oury case was the straw that broke the camel's back," said Emile Darai, secretary general of the National Congress of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians.
1667	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The group, unusually, issued a statement in October asking, "Do gynecologists and obstetricians now need police protection to practice?"
1668	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The statement affirmed that male and female doctors would treat patients "whatever their sex," and said it was the woman who has freedom "to determine contraception, abortion, sterilization without the opinion of her husband."
1669	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The experts recommending a charter for public institutions measured their words, affirming the rights of patients, but stressing the need for a "balanced approach."
1670	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	The report said there was no need to legislate on the issue, but stressed that respect for the functioning of the hospital was vital.
1671	APW_ENG_20070129.1041.LDC2009T13	It suggested a charter laying out the constitutionally guaranteed principle of secularism be adopted and that pertinent sections be posted at the relevant institutions.

1693	APW_ENG_20070905.0377.LDC2009T13	The battles on Tuesday and Wednesday came after Afghan forces claimed to have killed a Taliban commander involved in the kidnapping of 23 South Korean church workers in central Afghanistan in July.
1694	APW_ENG_20070905.0377.LDC2009T13	Afghan and coalition soldiers in Shah Wali Kot district, in southern Kandahar province, came under attack while on patrol Tuesday.

1702	APW_ENG_20070905.0377.LDC2009T13	A number of civilians were injured in the clash, the coalition said.

1717	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	When a pack of rats invaded a fast food restaurant here, many people were shocked as they watched widely distributed video footage of the dozen twitchy rodents scampering across the eatery's floor.
1718	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	But in a city like New York, businesses that handle food wage a seemingly endless battle against vermin.
1719	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference with the rats caught on tape this week at a joint KFC and Taco Bell restaurant?
1720	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Patrons usually do not see the creatures and certainly not in such large numbers.
1721	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing knowing it.
1722	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	It's another seeing it," said Nicole West, 23, who lives near the restaurant, which was shut down Friday and remained closed.
1723	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Trouble with mice, rats, cockroaches and other pests are not limited to restaurants.
1724	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	State sanitary reports show scores of small markets and prominent area grocery stores have at one point or another dealt with similar problems.
1725	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The city is a tough place," Jeffrey Eisenberg, president of Pest Away Exterminating in Manhattan, said in a recent interview.
1726	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a battle.
1727	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If you look, you're gonna find them."
1731	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors once discovered two rodent burrows in one supermarket's dairy cooler.
1732	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors over the years have uncovered rodent-defiled macaroni products, a live rat and a meandering mouse in a fresh corn display.
1733	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Of course, it is the sniveling rat that makes people most squeamish.
1735	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I mean, rats are supposed to be on the outside.
1736	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	And mice are on the inside.
1737	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If there's rats inside you got a real serious problem."
1739	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Whatever the number, the rats have continued to thrive despite the city spending millions to eradicate them.
1741	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Each year, a female rat can easily bear dozens of offspring that survive, said Frank Gasperini, a pest-control expert.
1742	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	They sometimes bite people, but mostly, they just eat -- at least one ounce of food every 24 hours, according to Bobby Corrigan, a rat expert.
1743	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	That means few food establishments are immune.
1747	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Jessica Leighton, the city's deputy commissioner of environmental health, said sloppy sanitation can attract rodents.
1748	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The basic message is, you need to remove food sources," she said.
1749	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"In restaurants, rodents are a symptom of poor sanitation."
1750	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Eisenberg, the exterminator, said wiping out vermin is impossible.
1751	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	His company kills about 50,000 rats and 250,000 a mice a year in the city, but it's a war that can't be won -- only managed.
1752	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC-Taco Bell, said the incident was unacceptable and a violation of its high standards.
1757	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I think this restaurant is pretty much done," she said.

1821	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	The network plans to air footage next week that shows Blankenship telling the unidentified producer, "If you're going to start taking pictures of me, you're liable to get shot," ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said.
1822	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship then moved quickly toward the producer, grabbed his camera and snapped off a microphone before putting his hand's to the man's throat and tearing his shirt collar, Schneider said.
1823	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship offered a different version of events, saying the producer followed his Cadillac into the parking lot, got out, trained a camera on him and put it too close to his face.
1824	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	"I reached up and moved the camera aside a little bit and he took great offense," he said.

1843	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Eurocopters were meant to replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky helicopters, renamed Nuri by the Malaysians.

1885	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	CWB meteorologists pointed out that as of 5 p.m. Sunday, the center of Hagupit -- the 14th storm in the Western Pacific this year -- was located about 710 km southwest of Eluanbi, Taiwan's southernmost tip.
1886	CNA_ENG_20080921.0018.LDC2009T13	They said that Hagupit, which has a radius of 250 km, was moving northwest at a speed of 21 kph and is likely to change direction slightly toward west- northwest.

1896	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua)
1897	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	Swiss biotech company Syngenta has opened the first foreign- funded crop research organization in China.
1898	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	The Syngenta Biotechnology (China) Co Ltd., in the Zhongguancun Life Science Park, would focus on improving yields and drought resistance of crops like corn and soy, as well as conversion to biofuels.
1899	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	"China is increasingly recognized for the scale and caliber of its biotech expertise in agriculture," said Wang Xun, president of Syngenta Biotechnology China.
1900	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	"Now that we have our own research base in Beijing, we can accelerate innovation and offer powerful opportunities to work more closely with Chinese research institutes, which is all the more relevant in a world that sees higher global demand for crops," he said.
1901	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	Syngenta plans to invest 65 million U.S. dollars (443 million U.S. dollars) in the new center in the next five years.
1902	XIN_ENG_20081027.0282.LDC2009T13	Syngenta was expanding its partnerships to contribute to further growth in Chinese agriculture with seeds and crop protection technology, said Dr. David Lawrence, head of the Syngenta Research and Development.

1906	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	PROGRAM HELPS PEOPLE {LSQUO}READ ' PERSONALITIES
1907	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts - We've all been there.
1910	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Frustrated with a spouse who is overly sensitive, or who can be blunt and unemotional.
1911	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In the workplace, social settings, and family situations, effective communication is key to productive relationships.
1912	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But different personality types communicate in different ways, often causing communication breakdowns when opposing styles clash.
1917	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The goal of the training is not to manipulate other people or become a human chameleon with an ever-changing disposition, but to learn to adapt the way you interact with others to their temperaments.
1918	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The benefit is improved personal and professional relationships, enabling managers to delegate more effectively, bosses to better motivate their employees, coworkers and family members to interact more harmoniously, and people with very different personalities to quickly establish rapport.
1919	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"This is not about being disingenuous," said Bink Garrison, a senior vice president at Vertex.
1920	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's about being aware of behavior that will be counterproductive in an interaction with the other person.
1921	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	You just modify your behavior in the name of better interpersonal interaction."
1922	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	SpeedReading People LLC was founded in 2004 by Paul D. Tieger, an author of several books on personality type and a former jury consultant.
1923	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The private company now has seven employees, with offices in Natick and Hartford, and its clients range from law firms to hospitals to software and financial services firms to the US Coast Guard.
1924	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The one-day program teaches participants to watch for behavioral clues - such as energy level, pace of speech, sentence structure, body language, and word choices - that hint at a person's personality and communication style.
1926	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	So participants are taught to treat the clues as a "working hypothesis" that will evolve with future interactions.
1928	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	When dealing with such a person, emphasize the larger picture and avoid too many details.
1929	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who talks in short, concise sentences responds precisely to what is said, and uses down-to- earth speech is probably a so-called sensor.
1931	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In many ways, consciously or not, all of us make these subtle tweaks in our communication styles all the time.
1932	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But we often do this by trial and error, and only after repeated personality conflicts that finally force a new approach.
1933	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	SpeedReading People aims to make this process instinctive and immediate, so we don't reach a point of exasperation before realizing that our method of communicating is at odds with someone else's.
1936	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The program also cautions not to assume that someone you have trouble communicating with is simply dense or difficult.
1938	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	At Vertex, which is hiring new employees at a rate of about one person per business day, innovation is critical to the company's mission of developing drugs that treat devastating diseases.
1939	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That means its workers must be able to communicate effectively with each another, since poor communication impedes innovation, Garrison said.
1942	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"I was having a discussion on a very high conceptual level with a person who really needed a lot more detail and a more linear progression of ideas," recalled Wilson, 39, who has worked at the company for five years.
1944	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Many other behavior-training programs focus on helping participants identify personality types, particularly their own, but few emphasize the practical application of this knowledge.
1945	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	By having participants watch video interviews, role play, and use online tools, SpeedReading People teaches not only how to categorize other people's temperaments, but how to communicate more effectively with them.
1946	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some personality types are obvious.
1947	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Extraverts tend to be high- energy, outgoing, talkative people, so it's beneficial to communicate verbally with them and keep the conversation lively.
1948	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Introverts tend to be reserved, private, quiet, and introspective, so it's advantageous to communicate with them in writing first if possible and give them time to reflect.
1949	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Other communication differences are more nuanced.
1950	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a coworker who frequently questions your decisions, he may not simply be an aggressive jerk
1952	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be assertive with him and avoid taking his remarks personally.
1953	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a boss who rarely smiles and never seems to break out of work mode, she may not be socially inept
1955	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be formal and direct with her.
1957	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But even a highly detailed e-mail or a terse, clipped phone call can offer insights into another person's personality.
1958	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	And those insights are helpful in both personal and professional contexts, no matter what your family life or work situation.
1959	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's basically important for anyone for whom relationships are important," said Toomey, "and if that doesn't capture everyone, then there's something wrong."
1960	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Rescuers hopeful of finding more survivors after Indonesian ferry disasters
1962	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Rescuers kept up their search Wednesday for more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in bad weather, holding out hope that people could still be found alive four days after the disaster.
1963	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	At least 212 people have been rescued so far, most of them plucked from life-rafts or clinging on to debris, but some 400 remain missing, said Navy Col. Jan Simamora, the head of the search and rescue mission.
1964	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	The survivors over the last 24 hours had drifted several hundred kilometers (miles) from where the Senopati Nusantara sank just before midnight Friday after being pounded by waves for 10 hours during a violent storm, Simamora said.
1965	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	"We are trying our utmost to find more," Simamora told The Associated Press.
1966	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	"We still hope that those in lifeboats are still alive."
1967	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	People in life-rafts or holding on to some form of buoyancy aid can survive for days in Indonesia's warm tropical waters.
1969	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Officials have reported seeing some bodies in the ocean, while at least two survivors said that many of the victims were trapped in the ship when it sank.
1970	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	Relatives of the missing have flocked to hospitals and ports along Java's coast, hoping their loved ones may turn up alive.
1971	APW_ENG_20070103.0190.LDC2009T13	The Senopati Nusantara was nearing the end of a two-day journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's main island of Java.

1976	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The England and Wales Cricket Board will decide next week whether the English team will compete in the Champions Trophy due to ongoing concerns over the security situation in Pakistan.
1978	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"The ECB takes it own security advice," chief executive David Collier said Friday.
1979	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Our board will be considering that on August 4, so we will have a look at that.
1980	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	There were concerns expressed not only by the ECB, but also by CA (Australia), CSA (South Africa), NZC (New Zealand).
1982	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It's primarily the external environment we're looking at and which we have raised some concerns over.
1983	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	We will be monitoring that very closely."
1984	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Collier said England's players would be consulted before any decision is taken.
1985	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're in very close touch with the PCA (Professional Cricketers Association)," he said.
1986	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Clearly, other boards around the world are in the same position.
1987	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The safety and security of our players is paramount and we won't compromise on that."
1989	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We've still got some very serious concerns, despite the fact that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have made every effort they can to try to make it as safe as possible," Morris said.
1990	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"But, unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyone's control."
1991	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf tried to reassure participating nations by noting the security at last month's Asia Cup.
1992	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"The security firm of the ICC gave us (an) 'A' grade in the arrangements made during the Asia Cup," he said, adding that Pakistan is a "safe country to play cricket in."
1994	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"Our security advisers are very confident," Lorgat said.
1995	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We know of no credible threat against the event or any players.
1996	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	The Asia Cup was held recently and there were no incidents.
1997	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	It was a pretty safe event."
1998	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Yet concerns remain.
1999	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Australian Cricketers Association chief Paul Marsh said a boycott was possible.
2000	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There are many players, not just in Australia but all around the world, that are not comfortable with going to Pakistan at this time," Marsh said.
2001	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"So, the sad part about all of this is that the Champions Trophy looks like it's going to disintegrate into a second-rate event, unfortunately."
2004	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"From what we've seen from the various security reports compiled prior to the meeting in Dubai, there is no way you could consider Pakistan a safe workplace.
2005	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"We're not in a position where we can compromise on this issue.
2006	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	If we compromise on player safety for commercial considerations or politics, then in my view we might as well pack up our bags and go home."

2227	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Vice President Cheney personally orchestrated his office's 2003 efforts to rebut claims that the administration used flawed intelligence to justify the war in Iraq and discredit a critic who he believed was making him look foolish, according to testimony and evidence Thursday in the criminal trial of his former chief of staff.
2228	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney dictated talking points for a White House briefing in the midst of the controversy that summer, his former press aide, Cathie Martin, testified, stressing that the CIA never told him that a CIA-sponsored mission had found no real evidence that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa.
2229	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Aboard Air Force 2, on a trip back from the launch of a battleship in Norfolk, Va., Cheney instructed his chief of staff, Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, about responding to a Time magazine reporter who questioned how the faulty intelligence on Iraq had become one of the Bush administration's central arguments for going to war.
2230	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
2231	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
2232	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
2233	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss' instruction.
2234	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Lea Anne McBride, Cheney's current spokesperson, said Thursday evening that the vice president's office could not comment on the case or evidence introduced in the trial.
2235	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby, 56, is charged with lying to investigators and a grand jury about how the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA officer Valerie Plame, was leaked to the media days after Wilson went public with his claims that the administration had twisted his findings to justify the war in Iraq.
2236	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby has pleaded not guilty, contending he misspoke and forgot about conversations he had with journalists amid the crush of his duties.
2237	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	He is not charged with the leak itself.
2238	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin recalled telling Cheney and Libby information from CIA spokesman William Harlow that Wilson was the person sent to Niger ``and his wife works for the CIA.''
2239	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
2240	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
2241	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
2242	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney insisted that the administration had significant evidence that Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
2243	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney told Martin to alert the media that a highly classified and recent National Intelligence Estimate indicated no doubts about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium.
2244	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.
2245	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	On college rule paper, in blue ink, Martin scribbled what Cheney told her the press needed to know about the Niger controversy as they conferred in his Capitol Hill office on July 7, 2003.
2247	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
2250	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby later came to her seat in the back of the plane, holding a handwritten card with notes he said were Cheney's instructions about what to say to Cooper.
2251	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
2252	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
2253	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She said they directed her and her staff to begin monitoring television reports on the Niger trip and provide daily transcripts along with their usual canvas of printed stories about the vice president's office.
2254	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
2255	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``At no time did Vice President Cheney indicate to you that he considered Valerie Wilson part of the story he wanted to get out,'' attorney Theodore Wells said to Martin.
2257	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Danish drivers offered insurance against speeding tickets
2258	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Danish motorists can now sign an insurance policy against speeding tickets, the Danish car enthusiasts' club Fartklubben announced on Tuesday.
2259	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	For an annual membership fee of 995 kroner (134 euros, 183 dollars), members of the "Speeding Club" can have up to four fines reimbursed a year, with a maximum reimbursement of 10,000 Danish kroner (1,344 euros, 1,836 dollars).
2260	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	For an additional fee of 395 kroner (53 euros, 72 dollars), the club also offers to pay up to four parking tickets a year, totalling no more than 2,000 kroner (269 euros, 367 dollars).
2263	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	Poul Winther, the head of Fartklubben, told the free daily newspaper Urban that the initiative was not aimed at "urging (the drivers) to drive faster."
2264	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"But the police and the politicians are exploiting the fact that our cars can drive faster today to install radars which are cash cows," he said.
2265	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	The Danish Road Safety Council said meanwhile the initiative was foolish.
2266	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"If you can now take out insurance against dangerous behaviour, it is a serious attack against the road safety which has already seen a negative development due to the increased number of speeding offenses," Council official Jesper Soelund told Urban.

2270	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
2271	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.
2272	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days.
2273	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
2274	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
2275	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
2276	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
2278	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Campaigns are also aggressively trying to manage expectations, providing low-ball estimates of what they will raise while exaggerating predictions for their opponents.
2279	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
2280	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has similarly played down his goals, with aides saying they would be thrilled with a take of $7 million to $12 million this quarter.
2281	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
2282	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	One of the great unknowns is how former senator John Edwards, D-N.C., will fare.
2283	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton and Obama (as well as Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas) must pay at least some attention to their positions in the Senate, but Edwards is unencumbered by a day job and is still riding his popularity as the vice presidential nominee in 2004.
2284	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.
2285	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	For Edwards and other Democrats seeking to catch up with Clinton and Obama -- such as Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson -- the money flow, or lack thereof, could produce a moment of reckoning.
2286	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
2287	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''
2288	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Alan Solomont, chairman of Obama's fundraising effort in New England, described the campaign's fundraising venture as a ``start-up'' that has required building from the ground up in a short time.
2289	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama is holding low-dollar ``kickoff'' fundraisers in cities nationwide, including a $100-per-ticket fundraiser in Denver and a $25-per-ticket event in Oklahoma City in recent days, and a $100-per-ticket event in West Palm Beach this weekend.
2290	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton.
2291	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
2292	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``I had thought, `Boy, this is going to be quite an effort,' not knowing how to raise money or who to even turn to, and within a couple weeks' time we had more than quadrupled my expectations in terms of what we would raise,'' said Dan Nova, 45, a first-time presidential fundraiser who held the breakfast event at his house.
2293	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
2297	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	and signed up a talented team of Web designers at the company Blue State Digital to help power his online fundraising effort.
2298	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In the last election cycle, Blue State Digital helped former Vermont governor Howard Dean bring in a flood of low-dollar online donations that catapulted him into the spotlight.
2299	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who can roll over more than $11 million from her Senate race last year, has a huge, traditional network in place -- headed by the veteran Clinton finance guru, Terence McAuliffe -- and her husband, perhaps the party's biggest fundraising draw.
2301	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	he also attended Tuesday night's event (minimum donation: $1,000) at the Marriott Wardman Park.
2302	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In between, the former president was scheduled to attend a fundraising reception, at the home of Sheila and Jay Kaplowitz in Philadelphia.
2303	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Just as she is exceeding expectations everywhere she is going politically, we'd all like to exceed expectations when it comes to fundraising,'' said Steve Grossman, a major Clinton fundraiser in Boston.
2304	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He said Hillary Clinton, like Obama, is bringing in new donors every day.
2305	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	After an intimate ``friend-raising'' dinner at the home of Elaine and Gerry Schuster in Boston in February, Clinton supporters are preparing for a much larger gathering on March 30 -- just under the wire for first-quarter filing.
2306	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaign has asked donors to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31 tally.
2307	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Both Clinton and Obama are expected to hold fundraisers in Las Vegas later this week.
2312	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Either he's gotten all the money he's going to get or they've got so much money they don't need any more,'' the strategist said.
2314	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Romney, refused to offer a concrete goal for the quarter, adding: ``Everybody recognizes that fundraising totals should be reflective of the national polls.
2317	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	One Republican operative said that Paul Singer, a pioneer in hedge-fund investing and a Giuliani backer, is personally making calls to potential donors in New York and Washington, putting his own capital on the line to round up cash.
2321	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A week later, a second ``Exchange'' fundraiser was staged in New York, where a featured speaker was former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
2322	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Bush, an incumbent running without significant primary opposition, raised $36 million in the first six months of 2003.

2326	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	France on Monday cancels 204 billion CFA francs (425 million U.S. dollars) of debt against Cameroon, according to official sources.
2327	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	The agreement of the debt cancellation was signed on Monday in the capital of Yaounde between the French ambassador in Cameroon Georges Serre and Cameroonian minister for economy and finances Polycarpe Abah Abah.
2328	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	The debt cancellation falls under the framework of positive effects of reaching the point of the initiative of Heavily Indebted Poor Country (PPTE) in April 2008.

2330	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	France's debt cancellation came after those made by the United States, Belgium, Spain, Canada, Italy, Japan, China and Britain.
2331	XIN_ENG_20070507.0313.LDC2009T13	It also takes place in a moment particularly when France chooses Nicolas Sarkozy as the new president who promised to review the partnership which has characterized the relationships between France and the African countries for a long time.

2398	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	A Marine staff sergeant charged with unpremeditated murder in the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha admitted firing at five unarmed Iraqi men but said in an interview that their killing was justified.
2399	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, 26, spoke publicly for the first time about the events of Nov. 19, 2005, in an interview with the CBS' "60 Minutes," scheduled for broadcast Sunday night.
2400	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's squad.
2401	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	He said they tried to run from the car, instead of obeying an order not to.
2402	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Normally the Iraqis know the drill.
2403	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	If something happens, get down, hands up," Wuterich told CBS.
2405	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The Washington Post.
2407	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said the interview was filmed in late October somewhere near Camp Pendleton, Wuterich's home base.
2408	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich was charged in December with 13 counts of unpremeditated murder.
2409	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Three other squad members also were charged with unpremeditated murder and four officers were charged with failing to properly investigate or report the killings.
2410	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Tedesco said it is not unusual for a "60 Minutes" story to take months to report before it is broadcast.
2411	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's attorney Neal Puckett did not comment on the CBS interview and declined an Associated Press request to speak to Wuterich.
2412	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Following the taxi shooting, Wuterich said, he was given permission from a superior officer to raid a house suspected to have a sniper inside.
2413	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marines did this using grenades and gunfire, according the CBS News release.
2414	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he knew women and children were killed in that house, but he didn't stop the assault because he saw an open doorway leading toward a second house and believed the sniper had escaped through it.
2415	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"My responsibility as a squad leader is to make sure that none of the rest of my guys died," Wuterich told CBS.
2416	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was sorry women and children died, but he believes he was acting according to how he had been trained.
2417	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Did we know that civilians were in there?
2418	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	No," Wuterich told CBS.
2420	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marine sergeant said he regretted the deaths.
2421	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"There is nothing that I can possibly say to make up or make well the deaths of those women and children, and I am absolutely sorry it happened that day," Wuterich told CBS.
2423	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Those are decisions that I made in a combat situation and I believe I had to make those decisions."

2425	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	South Korea on Thursday raised its key interest rate for the first time in almost a year in an apparent attempt to curb high liquidity growth.
2426	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	At its monthly rate-setting session, the Bank of Korea increased the July target for the call rate by 0.25 percentage point to a six-year high of 4.75 percent.

2441	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
2444	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
2445	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
2447	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
2448	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
2452	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
2453	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
2455	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
2456	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now, what are your options?
2457	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Well, let's assume your building is older and that the concrete has been in place for some time.
2458	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
2460	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To deal with the moisture from the slab, use one or two dehumidifiers.
2461	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
2462	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
2464	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
2468	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
2469	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``That's too much,'' he said.
2475	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
2476	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Also what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
2477	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
2479	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
2480	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
2481	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told by organic experts that, depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant after a season or two.
2483	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Ants don't like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
2484	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
2485	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.
2486	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks, silverfish, flies and spiders.
2487	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.

2495	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In the latest attack, two car bombs exploded in the Karada district of southeast Baghdad, killing four people and wounding at least nine, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials.
2496	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	The blasts were the third attack on Shiite pilgrims observing Arbaeen, which commemorates the end of the 40-day mourning for the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and one of Shiite Islam's most revered holy men.
2497	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	At least 57 pilgrims have been killed during two days of attacks and more than 100 have been wounded.
2498	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	"We condemn this atrocity against innocent Iraqi citizens who were exercising their right to participate in a religious commemoration," said Col. Allen Batschelet, the chief of staff at Multinational Division Baghdad.
2499	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	In the remote mountains of northern Iraq on Monday, Turkey's military for a fourth day battled fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, attacking Kurdish hide-outs with fighter jets and ground artillery.
2500	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Monday's fighting brought the death toll to 17 Turkish soldiers and as many as 153 Kurdish fighters, the Turkish military said, though the PKK has reported far lower numbers of its own deaths.
2501	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Farther south, neither the continuing violence nor the rainstorms that swept over central Iraq on Monday stopped the thousands of Shiite pilgrims walking along highways, bearing red, green and black banners to the Shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala for the Arbaeen observance.
2502	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Iraqi security officials announced new measures to safeguard the pilgrims, and the minister of state for national security, Shirwan al-Waeli, was investigating the circumstances of Sunday's bombing in Iskandariya, 45 miles south of Baghdad.

2522	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
2524	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	A report released Tuesday by the Central Intelligence Agency includes new details of the agency's missteps prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, outlining what the report says were failures to grasp the role being played by the terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and to fully assess the threats streaming into the spy agency during the summer of 2001.
2525	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The 19-page report, prepared by the agency's inspector general, also says that between 50 and 60 CIA officers knew of intelligence reports in 2000 that two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hamzi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, may have been in the United States.
2526	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence of what it calls a systemic failure.
2527	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general recommended that several top agency officials, including former director George J. Tenet, be held accountable for their failure to implement a strategy to dismantle al-Qaida in the years before the Sept. 11 attacks.
2530	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet called many of the report's conclusions "flat wrong," and Hayden noted that many of those criticized in the review by the agency's inspector general probe have criticized the "focus, methodology and conclusions" of the report.
2531	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.
2534	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Among the lawmakers who voiced renewed anger at the CIA's decision not to discipline anyone was Rep. Rush D. Holt, D-N.J., a member of the House intelligence committee.
2535	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"Accountability is a concept the American people understand," Holt said in a statement, adding: "I am stunned that Gen. Hayden still does not get that message."
2538	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As spelled out in the executive summary that was released on Tuesday, the report found neither "a single point of failure" nor a "silver bullet" that would have allowed the CIA to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks.
2540	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
2541	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It cited "failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow through with operations and to properly share and analyze critical data."
2542	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report does not cite the names of the officials who it says "did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner," but it identifies some of them by their titles.
2543	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Besides Tenet, the probe criticizes James L. Pavitt, the CIA's former deputy director for operations
2545	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	and other top CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
2546	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
2547	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
2548	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report cited the CIA's failure to pass intelligence about al- Mihdhar and al-Hamzi to other agencies as potentially significant.
2550	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The inspector general report said some 50 to 60 CIA officials knew of the intelligence about the two men, a higher number than had been previously reported, and that persistent surveillance of them "had the potential to yield information on flight training, financing and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11 attacks.
2551	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure, and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida.
2552	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before Sept. 11, 2001.
2554	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden.
2556	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In describing the period prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, the report said the CIA had carried out "no comprehensive analysis that put into context the threats received in the spring and summer of 2001."
2557	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
2558	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
2560	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed," he said.
2562	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"I was impressed at how brutal and unforgiving they were on their own senior management, which I thought spoke very well of the institution," Zelikow said.

2564	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.

2574	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	New Zealand's team management had earlier considered wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum to fill in the opening vacancy in place of Vincent who Monday flew back home after fracturing his left wrist during a training session.
2575	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	McCullum had been tried as an opener by New Zealand, but then shifted back to the middle order where he had more success with the bat.

2581	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that a recovery from the financial crisis "will not happen right away" but that the US economy will eventually emerge "with renewed vigor."
2582	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman said that the problems in the economy and markets "are large and complex, but in my judgment, our government now has the tools it needs to confront and solve them."
2583	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke said the crisis "has many novel aspects" stemming from the globalization of markets and quick movements of money and information but that "the current situation also has much in common with past experiences."
2585	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in markets and financial institutions.
2586	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The massive 700-billion-dollar rescue approved by US lawmakers and similar measures in other countries will go a long way toward steadying markets, he said.
2587	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away," Bernanke said.
2588	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Economic activity had been decelerating even before the recent intensification of the crisis.
2589	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to be a primary source of weakness in the real economy as well as in the financial markets, and we have seen marked slowdown in consumer spending, business investment and the labor market.
2590	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Credit markets will take some time to unfreeze."
2591	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke added that the overall recovery "will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning."
2592	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Yellen said Tuesday that the US economy was likely to see "essentially no growth" in the third quarter and that that the fourth quarter "appears to be weaker yet, with an outright contraction quite likely."
2593	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Indeed, the US economy appears to be in a recession," Yellen said.
2594	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke meanwhile expressed confidence in the longer-term outlook once the credit and banking problems are fixed.
2595	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"I strongly believe that we now have the tools we need to respond with the necessary force to these challenges," he said.
2596	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Although much work remains and more difficulties surely lie ahead, I remain confident that the American economy, with its great intrinsic vitality and aided by the measures now available, will emerge from this period with renewed vigor."

2598	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Iraqi troops were in a tense standoff with radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al- Sadr's supporters on Friday after they surrounded an office block occupied by the group in the southern city of Basra.The move was blasted by Sadr's supporters as a "provocation" but the Iraqi government said the operation only aimed to recover offices unfairly occupied by political groups.
2601	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"The police and the army have laid siege to Sadr's office in Basra," office head Sheikh Harith al-Athari told AFP.
2602	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"They have also stopped people from attending Friday prayers.
2603	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"The forces, backed by armoured vehicles, have asked us to leave the building," he added.
2604	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Journalists reported Sadr supporters had refused to leave the office block in the oil city, which lies about 550 kilometres (340 miles) south of the capital.
2605	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Interior ministry spokesman General Abdel Karim Khalaf told AFP the operation had been approved by Maliki and aimed to "recover official buildings that were being occupied."
2606	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Salah al-Obeidi, a Sadr spokesman from the holy city of Najaf, in central Iraq, said "it is a provocation that will induce people to resort to force.
2607	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"The objective of the security forces is to further aggravate tensions and it shows the government's claims that it is not targeting Sadr supporters to be false," he added.
2608	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers from the Sadr political bloc lashed out at Maliki and his government, saying the cleric's movement was a target of a sustained campaign.
2609	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"These are not security operations.
2610	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	There is a hidden political agenda," said Falah Shanshal.
2611	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"It is a move to isolate the Sadr movement from the country's political process ahead of the elections.
2613	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	But the Sadr movement is a belief.
2614	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	It is a national movement."
2615	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	In October, Iraq will hold elections in all 18 provinces.
2618	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	You are creating hatred and negative feelings," Shanshal told AFP during a visit to Sadr City on Friday.
2619	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Sadr City has been a site of violent clashes between Shiite militiamen, mostly from Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, and Iraqi and US forces, since March 25 when Maliki ordered a crackdown in Basra.
2620	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Salah al-Ugaili, another Sadrist MP, said 398 people have been killed in the clashes and 1,331 wounded since March 25 in the sprawling impoverished district of eastern Baghdad.
2621	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	The figures were not independently confirmed.
2622	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Doctor Wiyam Rashhad, head of Al- Sadr hospital in Sadr City told AFP his facility had registered 135 people killed in the clashes and another 800 wounded.

2636	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	German scientists spotted Indonesian quake within five minutes
2637	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	German researchers said they measured the size and location of Wednesday's earthquake off Indonesia within a record five minutes in a development that could mean the difference between life and death for people in the path of a tsunami.
2638	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"We managed to get the information in under five minutes yesterday," Professor Joachim Zschau from Germany's national research centre for geoscience (GFZ) in Potsdam outside Berlin, told AFP on Thursday.
2639	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"In the past this was not possible, we could get it at best in under a quarter of an hour to half an hour," he said.
2640	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The German reaction time on Wednesday was more than 10 minutes faster than the alert raised by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii, which measures earthquakes around the ocean's massive faultline.
2641	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"The difference in time is really important because the challenge is to warn people away from the coastline within minutes.
2642	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	It takes 10 to 20 minutes before a tsunami hits the coastline," he said.
2644	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The 8.4-magnitude quake that struck off the west coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island was measured with software that the Germans had been developing even before the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster which killed 168,000 people in the island's Aceh province alone.
2645	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The GFZ's Alexander Rudloff said information was relayed via satellite from 11 measuring stations in the ocean to computers in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, where staff alerted the authorities.
2646	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The software system, called the "SeisComP", has been installed at various points around Indonesia as part of a new warning system that should be completed by 2008, he said.
2647	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	One of two components that must still be added to the detection system is a way of measuring where in the ocean a tsunami begins and where it will hit the coast.
2648	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	Zschau said the software had only been installed in recent weeks and his group was "relieved" that it passed a baptism of fire in the series of powerful quakes that has struck in the Pacific around Indonesia since late Wednesday.
2649	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	At least 10 people have died and some 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed, but fears that large-scale destruction mirroring the events of 2004 have so far proved unfounded.
2650	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The latest quake hit off the northern tip of Sulawesi Island early on Thursday, like the earlier ones triggering a tsunami warning that was soon cancelled.

2655	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The drop in retail sales for June followed an increase of 1.5 percent in May.
2656	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	In June, sales of autos and auto parts dropped by 2.9 percent, after a 1.1-percent gain in the previous month.
2657	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Sales at furniture stores were down 3.0 percent, the biggest plunge since February 2003, following a small rise of 0.3 percent in May.
2660	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Gasoline stations saw sales drop by 1.1 percent, a decline attributed to a temporary fall in gasoline prices in June.
2662	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The performance in retail sales reflects the situation of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity and is a major force pushing economic growth.
2663	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The June drop in retail sales was much sharper than the flat reading expected by economists and raised new worries about consumer spending, according to analysts.

2741	AFP_ENG_20080521.0381.LDC2009T13	Pakistani authorities reached a peace deal with pro-Taliban militants in the troubled northwestern Swat Valley on Wednesday after months of unrest, a provincial minister said.
2742	AFP_ENG_20080521.0381.LDC2009T13	Troops will gradually withdraw from Swat and Islamic law will be imposed in the former tourist region, while rebels will close down training camps and halt suicide attacks, North West Frontier Province minister Bashir Bilour said.
2743	AFP_ENG_20080521.0381.LDC2009T13	The army launched a major offensive in October to clear Swat of militants loyal to Maulana Fazlullah, a radical pro-Taliban cleric who led an uprising to enforce Islamic Sharia law in the valley.

2746	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	High levels of cancer-causing gases, apparently released by an oil refinery, on Wednesday triggered a public alarm system in an industrial city near Belgrade.
2747	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Sirens sounded in the morning and overnight in Pancevo, 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of the Serbian capital, prompting thousands of residents to remain indoors as air levels of benzene and chlorine soared to 10 times normal levels, officials said.
2748	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Serbia's environment minister Miroslav Nikcevic accused HIP Petrohemija -- Serbia's largest petrochemical plant with annual production of 800,000 tons of gasoline a year -- of releasing the harmful substances into the air.
2749	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	"They were siphoning the benzene in an open area, and the wind was blowing toward Pancevo's downtown," Nikcevic said.
2750	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	"The problem is that the plant's management informed no one about the operation."
2751	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's toxin levels were recorded at 118 micrograms per cubic meter of air, or about 10 times the "normal levels" in Pancevo, Nikcevic said.
2752	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	That has triggered concerns in Pancevo, a city of some 50,000 people, as well as among Belgrade's population of nearly 2 million.
2753	APW_ENG_20070207.0607.LDC2009T13	The plant was heavily bombarded during the 1999 NATO air attacks on Serbia over the Kosovo conflict, causing leakage and contamination of both the air and land.

2756	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Michael Ruiz de Somocurcio, a health insurance executive from Clifton, N.J., paid $5,500 to Celebration Studios, a regional photography service, before his wedding in September.
2757	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The price included albums, personalized thank-you notes and a DVD starring his wife, Erika, and himself.
2758	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	But the products never materialized.
2760	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of couples have been left with no visual record of their wedding day, and many brides-to-be who had made down payments now have no wedding photographers lined up.
2761	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	So instead of paging through their albums, newlyweds are filing police reports and lawsuits, and sifting through posts on Internet bulletin boards.
2762	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	And, along with people who are not yet married but who paid Celebration Studios in advance, they are vetting countless online offers from album makers, video editors and last-minute photographers engaged in what one bride-to-be called "ambulance chasing."
2764	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	It also issued an order to prevent them from selling or disposing of the wedding images that had not been delivered.
2766	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Until recently, Celebration Studios had a reputation for producing good work at a reasonable price.
2767	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Couples frequently took advantage of a 10- to 20-percent discount for paying in full in advance.
2768	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Last week, it was offering photography packages priced up to $3,995 and video packages costing up to $2,295 on its Web site, which has since shut down.
2769	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	But the company's fortunes recently plummeted.
2771	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The Montclair Police Department received about 40 fraud reports about the company from Jan. 11 through Jan. 18, said Deputy Chief Roger Terry.
2773	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Jeffrey Herrmann, a lawyer for Celebration Studios, provided a copy of a statement from the company, which read: "The primary intent of Celebration Studios has been and remains to preserve the memories of its customers.
2774	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Unforeseen financial difficulties have made it impossible to continue our business operations and deliver photos and videos in a timely manner."
2775	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The statement added that "to our knowledge, no photos or videos have been lost or destroyed."
2776	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Herrmann said that the copyrights of the images currently belonged to Celebration Studios.
2777	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Schwartz did not respond to e-mail messages sent to two addresses for him, and there was no response to phone messages left for Celebration Studios last week.
2778	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Herrmann said Celebration Studios would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in Newark in the next week.
2779	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	News reports of complaints about the company appeared last week in The Star-Ledger of Newark and on Philadelphia and New York television stations.
2780	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Photographers say they, too, have been cheated by the company.
2782	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She eventually got paid, after waiting three months.
2783	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"When you do a wedding, it's a 14-hour day often, and you spend a lot of money in gas and put your whole heart into it, and then you don't even get your gas money back," she said.
2784	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	According to the suit filed by the New Jersey attorney general, Anne Milgram, the nine-year-old company "engaged in the use of unconscionable commercial practices, false promises, misrepresentations and/or the knowing concealment, suppression or omission of material facts."
2785	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Nathaniel Burney, a Manhattan lawyer, filed a lawsuit against the company in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in December and is seeking a class-action certification for it.
2786	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"As of 2005, obviously Celebration Studios knew that people were not getting their pictures, and since then they continued soliciting and taking people's money," he said, citing problems at least two years old.
2787	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"People are giving them their family heirloom photographs and baby pictures, and not getting the pictures of the most important days of their lives."
2788	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Melissa Brown, a New Jersey lawyer and bride who said she was defrauded by the company, is also planning a lawsuit.
2790	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	One bride-to-be, Lisa Trapasso of Ossining, N.Y., said she felt betrayed by Celebration Studios.
2793	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"I feel rabid about it."
2797	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In Sunday's final, she faces Vera Zvonareva, who beat Russian compatriot Elena Dementieva for the first time 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3.
2798	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams was 4-1 lifetime against Zvonareva.
2799	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	This will be Zvonareva's third final of the year, and fourth since her last title at 2006 Cincinnati.
2802	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I'll have to not have ups and downs in the match and play as even as possible."
2805	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In a second set featuring long baseline rallies, Williams broke Cornet in the eighth game, then held serve at love to take the match.
2806	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"In just the whole match I thought she played really well, and I just wasn't playing my game," Williams said.
2807	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I got caught a little bit on the defensive a lot and I wasn't doing anything I should have been doing."
2808	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Cornet, an 18-year-old ranked No. 40 in the world, also made the semifinals at Amelia Island last week.
2809	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She was runner-up earlier this year at Acapulco, her best showing on the tour since joining it last year.
2810	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Saturday was the first time she faced Williams.
2811	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"It was a little bit of a surprise for her because she didn't know me," Cornet said.
2812	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I was like making the pressure on her and it was working and after 4-1, you know, she played better."
2814	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I have to fight and I have to play my game, and I think I have the level now for beating the best, so it's a lot of confidence for me," she said.
2816	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"She gets a lot of balls back, and those kind of players are usually around for a good 20 years," Williams said.
2818	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Her only loss was in the Australian Open quarterfinals.
2819	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Reaching her latest final ensured the eight-time Grand Slam winner passed $19 million (euro12 million) in career earnings for No. 6 on the women's all-time list.
2820	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She played in the Charleston final previously in 2003, losing to Justine Henin.
2821	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	A day after No. 9-seeded Zvonareva knocked out top seed and defending champion Jelena Jankovic, she broke No. 4 Dementieva for 3-1 in the first set and held on, then rallied from 3-0 down in the second to force a tiebreaker.
2822	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In the third, Zvonareva again rallied in a match in which she took her chances far better.
2823	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Zvonareva converted seven of 10 break points, Dementieva only five of 22.
2824	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I was just trying to find a way to win the match.

2827	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The annual hajj in Saudi Arabia entered its final day on Friday as the last of almost 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims took part in the ritual "stoning of Satan."
2830	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	People spoke of their joy at completing the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam which all Muslims must undertake once in a lifetime if they have the means to do so.

2833	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	After throwing their pebbles at the pillars, pilgrims began returning to the Grand Mosque in Mecca before making their trip home.
2835	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Temptations are many, you know," said Sami, a Canadian Muslim from Toronto performing the hajj with his wife.
2838	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	There have been no reported deaths or injuries caused by overcrowding at this year's celebrations, but thousands of people have lost their lives during previous pilgrimages, some in stampedes as pilgrims jostled and pushed to get close to Satan's pillars.
2840	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The worst incident was in 1990 when 1,426 people suffocated in a tunnel at Mina after a ventilation system broke down.
2842	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	According to official Saudi figures a total of 2,454,325 pilgrims from 181 nations, 1,707,814 of them from outside the kingdom, are performing this year's pilgrimage.
2843	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The pillars at Jamarat are traditionally believed to be the place where the devil appeared to Abraham, his wife Hagar and son Ishmael.
2844	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	This year Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became the first president of the Islamic republic to take part in the hajj after he was invited to attend by King Abdullah.
2845	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	His visit had an added political significance because of the sometimes rocky relations between Shiite Iran and Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia, both key players in the Middle East.

2908	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires were spotted at 10:00 a.m. Friday in the forest areas between Heihe City and Yichun City, bordering the Lesser Hinggan Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, said a provincial meteorological bureau spokesman.
2909	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The two largest fires in Xunke County of Heihe City, were estimated to cover 5.5 and 6.6 square km respectively, according to earlier report.
2910	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	Six helicopters have been dispatched to carry firefighters and scout for fire condition, while provincial meteorological bureau is working to induce artificial rains.
2911	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires, fanned by high winds of 29 to 50 kilometers per hour, are spreading quickly.
2912	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	"It is hard to make out the size of forests devoured by the blaze on satellite pictures due to clouds," an official with the meteorological bureau told Xinhua in an interview.
2914	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	Chinese vice premier Hui Liangyu urged local government on Friday to check the fires as soon as possible and other areas in China liable to forest fires, and enforce prevention and monitoring work during the National Day Holiday.

2916	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Judge orders Paris Hilton be brought to court for hearing
2917	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-06-08 16:13:46 UTC
2918	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered that Paris Hilton be brought to court Friday for a hearing on her early release from jail rather than listen to the proceeding by telephone.
2919	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer was the latest in a flurry of developments surrounding Hilton's early release from prison.
2920	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That move sparked protests by many -- including local and state authorities and civil rights leaders -- who argued it could interpreted as affording the socialite favors not available to other, less famous, inmates.
2921	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Sauer's decision was announced by court spokesman Allan Parachini shortly before the start of a hearing that could put her behind bars again for violating probation in a reckless driving case.
2922	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Judge Sauer has instructed the Sheriff's Department to go to Ms. Hilton's residence, pick her up and bring her here.
2923	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That is happening now," Parachini told reporters outside the courthouse.
2924	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton on Thursday was originally ordered to report to court at 9 a.m. (1600 GMT) and the judge signed an order for deputies to bring her in a sheriff's vehicle from her home, said Allan Parachini.
2925	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	But early Friday, Parachini had announced that she would be allowed to take part in the hearing by telephone.
2926	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
2927	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk at news cameras.
2928	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	One of them was Moses Baltazar who was attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket.
2929	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he was no fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from her.
2930	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.
2931	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Driving like that, you have to behave.
2932	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	If you're rich, you have money, you have to respect yourself," he said, adding he thinks she should be returned to jail.
2933	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence.
2934	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She had spent three days, and was credited for five.
2935	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton was fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and was expected to finish the sentence for a reckless driving probation violation at her four-bedroom, three-bath home.
2936	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
2937	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention.
2938	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Late Thursday, Sauer issued the order for Hilton to return to court after the city attorney filed a petition demanding that Hilton be returned to jail and to show cause why Baca should not be held in contempt of court.
2939	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca does not have to be in court, and it was unclear who would represent the Sheriff's Department.
2940	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The move also was met with outrage from the sheriff's deputies union, members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, civil rights leaders, defense attorneys and others.
2941	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"What transpired here is outrageous," county Supervisor Don Knabe told The Associated Press, adding he received more than 400 angry e-mails and hundreds more phone calls from around the country.
2942	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's return home "gives the impression of ... celebrity justice being handed out," he said.
2943	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca dismissed the criticism, saying the decision was made based on medical advice.
2944	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It isn't wise to keep a person in jail with her problem over an extended period of time and let the problem get worse," Baca told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
2945	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca said.
2946	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	California Attorney General Jerry Brown criticized the Sheriff's Department for letting Hilton out of jail, saying he believed she should serve out her sentence.
2947	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It does hold up the system to ridicule when the powerful and the famous get special treatment," Brown told The Associated Press in an interview before testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.
2948	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure there's a lot of people who've seen their family members go to jail and have various ailments, physical and psychological, that didn't get them released," he said.
2949	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'd say it's time for a course correction."
2950	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The Los Angeles County jail system is so overcrowded that attorneys and jail officials have said it is not unusual for nonviolent offenders like Hilton to be released after serving as little as 10 percent of their sentences.
2951	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip.
2952	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	As word spread that the 26-year-old poster child for bad celebrity behavior was back home, radio helicopter pilots who normally report on traffic conditions were dispatched to hover over her house and describe it to morning commuters.
2953	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Paparazzi photographers on the ground quickly assembled outside its gates.
2954	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her attorney.
2956	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I am going to serve the remaining 40 days of my sentence.
2957	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	I have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes."
2958	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's path to jail began Sept. 7, when she failed a sobriety test after police saw her weaving down a street in her Mercedes- Benz on what she said was a late-night run to a hamburger stand.
2959	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 (euro1,124) in fines.
2960	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the months that followed she was stopped twice by officers who discovered her driving on a suspended license.
2961	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The second stop landed her in Sauer's courtroom, where he sentenced her to jail.

3083	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	Every now and then I feel as though I've woken up in a Rembrandt etching -- a tangled thicket of pen-strokes from which a landscape emerges.
3084	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	It's not just that the sky has taken on the tint of 17th-century drawing paper or that the world has lost color.
3085	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	It has more to do with the balance of time.
3086	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	Nature seems to have paused.
3087	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	There is a numb overcast overhead, with little drift to it.
3088	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	Wood smoke slides down the roof and onto the road.
3089	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	The wild apples are waiting to fall.
3090	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	I imagine being the human in one of Rembrandt's landscapes -- that small figure standing in front of what looks like either a house or a haystack.
3091	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	He is resting from something, perhaps looking out from his garden at the artist working in the distance.
3092	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	It took no more ink to draw that figure than it would to write out a simple equation.
3093	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	And yet there's no mistaking his posture or the moment he's given himself to rest, though that moment has now lasted since 1645.
3094	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	That's how it felt this morning, as if time had stopped.
3096	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	I counted 15 immobile mourning doves resting on a power line.
3097	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	The leaves that were going to fall had fallen, and the oaks were not about to relinquish theirs.
3098	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	I heard what sounded like a small dog barking in the distance and realized it was a flock of geese beyond the tree line.
3099	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	They never came into view.
3100	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	Before long the breeze will stir, and rain will fall.
3101	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	The silent anticipation hidden in such a quiet morning will be forgotten.
3102	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	The cry of a red-tailed hawk will unsettle the mourning doves, and one by one those wild apples will become windfall.
3103	NYT_ENG_20081108.0093.LDC2009T13	And as the weather changes and the clock resumes its ticking, I will have to free myself from the artist's ink before it dries, stepping outside and walking over the hill toward the sound of distant geese.

3105	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	FRANKFURT, Germany 2007-12-21 11:30:29 UTC
3106	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	There are "major uncertainties" swirling around the economic outlook for the euro zone in 2008, the president of the European Central Bank said.
3107	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	In an interview with EuroNews that aired Friday, Jean-Claude Trichet said that the bank's governing council, which sets interest rates for the 13-nation euro zone, are worried about the risk of weaker growth.
3108	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It is true there are major uncertainties with regard to the economic situation," he said.
3110	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	A transcript of the interview, along with a video, was posted on the broadcaster's Web site.
3113	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It could be that the end of 2008 is a rebound moment if we see after six months that all the accounts have been balanced and confidence returns."
3114	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet, asked why the bank has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent since June, Trichet said the ECB has been acting within its mission to control inflation.
3116	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"In terms of the 320 million people living in the euro zone we therefore make our monetary policy decisions to ensure price stability.
3117	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	That is our principal mandate."
3118	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet also reiterated previous remarks that the bank would not tolerate the excuse of higher energy and food prices as a reason to increase wages, thus spurring inflation.
3119	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Because then, we would have what we call second-round effects, leading to inflation which would be long lasting, instead of being temporary and related to higher costs for oil and raw materials and we would be unable to comply with our mandate, to ensure price stability, and we wouldn't be doing what our fellow citizens expressly ask us to," Trichet said.
3120	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, the bank said it would mop up as much as euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion) in a move to drain liquidity from the markets.
3121	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The bank also reaffirmed its intent to keep steering liquidity to a more balanced condition so as to align short-term interest rates with the refinancing minimum bid rate, which is 4 percent.
3122	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The move followed a similar operation on Thursday, that was also for euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion).

3140	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	So far 182 countries have become member states of the CWC, leaving only 13 outside.
3141	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	The CWC is an international disarmament treaty which bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
3146	XIN_ENG_20071105.0324.LDC2009T13	Last year's conference decided to postpone the deadline for the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles until April 2012.

3254	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Defending champion Kimmie Meissner of the United States was fourth, scoring 180.23.
3255	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Meissner, skating a flamenco routine, had a couple of jumps undervalued.

3257	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	I can do better," Meissner said.
3258	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	"So I will regroup and come back next year."
3259	APW_ENG_20070324.0565.LDC2009T13	Last year, Meissner dazzled in the free skating to win after the Olympics as the stars in Turin failed to show up or faltered in the worlds.

3266	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.
3267	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She has never seen a bill.
3268	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
3269	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs.
3270	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
3271	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
3272	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
3273	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
3277	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
3280	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
3284	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
3286	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
3289	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In Texas, where illegal immigrants generally can't get routine care, some have cycled through the emergency room at El Paso's Thomason Hospital more than 100 times for life-saving dialysis, said kidney specialist Dr. Azikiwe Nwosu.
3292	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Your hands are tied."

3295	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their presence.
3298	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The federal government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.
3299	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

3301	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Debates have flared over chemotherapy, life-support and dialysis.
3303	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It failed.
3305	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.
3308	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It has long been left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis, she said.
3309	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states, including Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, take the position that kidney failure does not automatically qualify as an emergency because patients can survive for weeks without dialysis before toxins accumulate to fatal levels.
3310	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Other states have wavered.
3313	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Georgia ain't California or New York," said Mark Trail, head of Georgia's Medicaid program until last month, noting a strong conservative tradition.
3314	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
3315	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
3316	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
3318	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	California's dialysis policy is largely an economic calculation, said Stan Rosenstein, the administrator of Medi-Cal, the state health-care program for the poor that covers dialysis for illegal immigrants.
3319	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of one routine treatment is about $250.
3320	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
3322	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"Taxpayers are on the hook for people who aren't supposed to be here," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
3323	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will lure more sick people from other countries.
3325	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
3326	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Now, a free transportation service picks her up three days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
3327	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"If I go home, I won't be able to afford this," said Aquino, 56.
3329	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California, but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand the gravity of their plight.

3331	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid program does not.
3332	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dr. Karla Vital, a kidney specialist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, said her hospital encourages Mexican nationals to return to Mexico.
3333	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals pay for plane tickets back.
3334	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Mexico offers dialysis to those who can afford it, but access is far more limited for the poor.

3336	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
3337	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
3338	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"I have friends who have died because of lack of dialysis," said Lopez, a longtime diabetic who arrived in the U.S. four years ago while her kidneys were still functioning.
3339	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal immigrants.
3340	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
3341	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three dialysis-free years.
3342	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Critics, however, say that dipping into the organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are waiting.
3344	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
3345	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She said she is grateful for the care she has received in California.
3346	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.
3347	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents in Mexico, she has never returned.
3348	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be able to get back.
3349	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	STARBUCKS PLANS RETURN TO ITS ROOTS
3351	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Howard D. Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced sweeping changes on Wednesday for the company as it seeks to reconnect with customers who have left for competitors or pared back their coffee budget in hard economic times.
3352	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The initiatives are intended to restore an authentic coffeehouse experience to the company's stores and, in turn, re-energize an ailing stock that has lost half its value in the last 15 months.
3353	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow customers to see baristas making their beverage.
3354	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He said the company would roll out the Swiss-made Mastrena machines to three- fourths of Starbucks stores by 2010.
3355	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one cup at a time.
3356	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The price was not disclosed.
3358	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz described a host of other plans: a pungent new coffee blend, a partnership with Conservation International to certify environmentally responsible whole-bean espresso products, and a rewards program for users of the Starbucks customer card.
3359	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Beginning in mid-April, users of the customer card will be able to customize their drinks -- with soy milk or vanilla, for example -- at no cost.
3360	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The announcements are intended to help Starbucks hang on to customers in the face of intensifying competition for brewed coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, which is widely introducing espresso beverages this year.
3361	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This was more of a position statement.
3362	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	They are going back to their core," said Sharon Zackfia, a securities analyst with William Blair &amp
3363	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	amp
3365	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters.
3366	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people are making unique claims about coffee and what they do," he said.
3367	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"What's interesting to me is that they are not coffee roasters."
3368	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	But Schultz tried largely to keep the focus on the company's internal challenges and future moves.
3369	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time the U.S. business is under pressure.
3370	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	It's a character test," he said.
3371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
3372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
3373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
3374	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Don't believe the media hype.
3376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
3377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
3378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
3379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
3380	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis.
3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
3382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the face of those pressures, Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago.
3383	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He quickly announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least profitable Starbucks stores in the United States.
3384	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He also said Starbucks would stop selling a line of breakfast sandwiches that were served warm, creating an aroma that overwhelmed that of the coffee in stores.
3385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the company's early devotion to high-quality coffee.
3386	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The new coffee blend, called Pike Place Roast, is a reference to the location of the first Starbucks store.
3387	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will introduce the blend in stores next month.
3388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Baristas will be directed to brew smaller batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30 minutes.
3389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
3390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
3391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community, mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will contribute to a corporate blog.
3392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Customers will also be encouraged to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with employees.
3393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
3394	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
3395	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
3396	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
3397	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The last innovation widely thought to be successful was the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
3398	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz partly has his own relentless ambition to blame for the woes at Starbucks.
3399	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, citing ever-larger expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity to one another and to competing coffee shops.
3400	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
3401	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
3402	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
3403	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event as early as 6 a.m.
3404	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	As a barbershop quartet sang and employees dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
3405	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm.
3406	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks is his heart," said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was there with her husband, Bill.
3407	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I have every confidence he will turn the company around so this stock can take our family on our 50th wedding anniversary trip next year."

3410	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The Bank of Canada took an unusual step Thursday of publicly reassuring investors that it will help provide stability to financial markets and the domestic financial system.
3411	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	"In light of current market conditions, the Bank of Canada would like to assure financial market participants and the public that it will provide liquidity to support the stability of the Canadian financial system and the continued functioning of financial markets," the central bank said in a brief statement.
3412	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	Although these activities are part of the bank's normal operations, it affirmed that it is closely monitoring developments, and will deal with issues as they arise.
3413	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The bank's increased participation in the money markets stems from Thursday's turbulent Canadian and U.S. stock market activity.
3414	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The markets were further impacted after French bank BNP Paribas SA announced the suspension of three asset-backed securities funds, saying it could not value them accurately.

3418	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO
3419	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening its belt.
3420	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better- tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving some consumers with less discretionary income.
3421	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"This is a very tough operating environment for us, and we're not alone," Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive, said in an interview.
3422	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to reflect the tough economy."
3424	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
3426	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than- expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic environment as the weakest in the company's history.
3427	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Wall Street analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
3428	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Most recently, Starbucks has suffered the effects of the crisis in the housing market, particularly in southern California and south Florida.
3429	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
3430	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
3431	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbuck's shares.
3432	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The stock, which fell 11 percent after the company's warning last week, rose 3 cents, to $16.23 a share, in regular trading.
3434	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
3435	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue.
3436	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.
3437	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
3438	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"There are no sacred cows."
3439	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020 stores this year, down from its previous target of 1,175, and to open fewer than 400 stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
3440	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
3441	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
3442	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to $800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011.
3443	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
3444	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
3445	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service.
3446	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company also announced three new cold beverages.
3447	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures.
3448	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company expects revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent this year.
3449	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.

3456	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	The UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari proposes independence for the Albanian- populated Serbian province in his confidential report, excerpts of which were quoted by the French newspaper Le Monde on Tuesday.
3457	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"Independence under international supervision is the only viable option" for Kosovo, Ahtisaari said in the report that was sent to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon last week.
3458	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	According to Le Monde, Ahtisaari wrote that "maintaining an international administration was not tenable" for Kosovo but that its "reintegration into Serbia was not a viable option."
3459	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"The time has come to determine the status of Kosovo," said Ahtisaari, following eight years of UN rule in the province.
3460	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"Independence offers the only guarantee against the risk" of instability, he said.
3461	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"It's also the only chance for a sustainable partnership with Serbia."
3462	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Under the plan, Kosovo would have its own constitution but would "for an initial phase" be placed under the international monitoring of "civilian personnel" named by the European Union.
3463	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	NATO forces would continue to be present at the outset and the Serb minority would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, according to the report quoted by Le Monde.

3493	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	The 30-year-old veteran of the Israel team believes the tournament will act as a significant boost for Israeli water polo.

3505	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were here to promote "The Counterfeiters."
3507	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	.
3508	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But their excitement was already evident about the possibility of winning this year's best foreign language picture Oscar - which, in fact, "The Counterfeiters" did.
3510	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when asked if the award had much meaning a continent away.
3512	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are back home," Ruzowitzky said.
3513	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"For the Austrian public, a film festival doesn't mean anything - whereas 'Academy Award' is just immense.
3514	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
3515	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism, or its absence, is a central concern in "The Counterfeiters."
3517	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's a crook, a survivor - but also a master of his trade and a man who does his best to protect his fellow workers.
3521	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
3522	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Neither?
3523	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"No, he's not a hero," Markovics said.
3525	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are no heroes under these conditions.
3529	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Then we find out he does have ideals.
3530	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good citizen.
3532	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.
3533	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The printers take pride in their work because they are, in their way, artists, too.
3534	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A counterfeiter is not unlike an actor or filmmaker.
3535	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Each earns his income creating a version of reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
3536	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of Sally.
3537	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
3539	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Bearded and amiable, he could be a professor playing hooky from MIT, a few blocks away from the Hotel Marlowe, where the interview took place.
3540	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Of course I look different," he said with a smile.
3541	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to be in a concentration camp."
3542	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference is more than just a matter of having put on a few pounds.
3543	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
3544	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I always have fun playing characters not really hiding but giving the impression there's much more under the surface," Markovics said.
3545	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"This always attracts me more than showing everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing.
3546	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	This character especially gave me a chance to do this."
3547	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The source of the movie is a memoir by Adolf Burger.
3548	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger, who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his radical political views.
3549	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He tried to sabotage the forgeries, risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
3550	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger is played in the movie by August Diehl.
3551	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
3552	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In a camp, you can't do the right thing or the wrong thing.
3553	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	All these different perspectives are understandable.
3554	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and is the one who stands up against the Nazis.
3555	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So actually we shot some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow.
3556	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Why?
3558	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	World War II seems very much a thing of the past to his generation, said Ruzowitzky, who's 46.
3559	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's the Holocaust, rather than the war, that I think about.
3561	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For Americans the war is Omaha Beach, Iwo Jima, battles, soldiers.
3564	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
3565	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The one hard and fast rule he had while filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's point of view.
3566	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
3568	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	We never, ever did a shot over-shoulder of one of the Nazis.

3591	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev SA formed the world's largest brewer Tuesday when it completed its $52 billion (euro41 billion) takeover of Anheuser- Busch Cos.

3702	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Now sometimes I help in the kitchen and I know how to make all the Iranian food," Ahmadinejad said.
3703	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Pressed by the interviewer for more details, Ahmadinejad continued in typically defiant fashion.
3704	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	"Of course what I make is delicious -- ask everyone who has eaten it!
3705	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	I can make all the different kinds of soups and Iranian stews," said the president.
3706	AFP_ENG_20070828.0366.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad, who has long boasted of his ability to work hard, said he is often at his desk by 5:30 am and sometimes does not leave until after midnight.

3716	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a handshake.
3719	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	In his six years as governor, Richardson, whom President-elect Barack Obama has chosen to be commerce secretary, has created 80,000 jobs while revamping this impoverished state's economy.
3720	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The governor has created a thriving film industry here from scratch and has nurtured a fledgling solar-energy sector, mostly through tax breaks for investors.
3723	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Just about every project he put on the table was big and visionary and cost a lot of money," said Teri Cole, the president of the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce.
3725	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	It remains to be seen whether Richardson can do something similar on the national level.
3726	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he wants his commerce secretary to play a pivotal role in salvaging the economy, and aides to Richardson say they expect that he will try to expand the traditional role of the office.
3728	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to be, in some respects, reinventing the Department of Commerce."
3729	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Richardson said at a news conference here on Thursday that he would apply to the national economy some of the same principles he used to create jobs in New Mexico.
3731	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But economists and political opponents point out that Richardson has benefited from record-high oil and natural gas prices during his tenure as governor.
3732	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	As a result, state coffers were overflowing with revenue from taxes on oil and gas production.
3733	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
3734	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The oil and gas revenue also made it easier to finance big projects, like the $230 million spaceport and a $400 million commuter railroad from south of Albuquerque to Santa Fe.
3735	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Economists say that job growth, too, owed a lot to the boom in the oil and natural gas fields.
3736	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	With the price of oil plummeting, the growth in jobs has leveled off here and a projected $500 million shortfall has opened up in the state budget.
3737	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Still, no one doubts the state would be worse off in the current recession had it not been for Richardson's success in attracting investment and creating jobs.
3738	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Business leaders whom Richardson has wooed say he is a tough negotiator, hard to resist one on one.
3739	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Gerald J. Fine, the president of Schott North America, recalled how in January Richardson, who was then running for president, took the time to personally negotiate a deal under which Schott would build a $100 million plant in Albuquerque to make solar energy panels.
3740	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It was the only time I've ever been given a presidential candidate's cell phone number by a presidential candidate," Fine said.
3741	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Just before the New Hampshire primary, Richardson met with the company's board chairman, Udo Ungeheuer, at a hotel in Concord.
3742	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	After they went over the fine points of the agreement, Richardson, a physically imposing man, suddenly stood and reached a big hand over the table and asked, "Do we have a deal?"
3743	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Ungeheuer was taken aback, but a few seconds later shook on it, according to people who were present.
3744	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"The way the deal was sealed was with a handshake, and he made sure he got that handshake before he left the room," said Fine, still sounding somewhat incredulous.
3745	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We built a plant in New Mexico on the basis of a handshake."
3746	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Some of Richardson's detractors, however, say he can be overbearing and vicious when he does not get his way.
3747	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He enjoys the limelight that comes from his visionary pronouncements, they say, and he is impatient with opponents.
3748	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It's his way or the highway," said the state Senate president pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat who has clashed with the governor over spending.
3749	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Anyone who dares to differ with him, he doesn't take very well."
3750	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the growth of the film industry in New Mexico attests to Richardson's skills as a salesman and deal-closer.
3751	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Shortly after taking office in 2003, the governor went to Hollywood to meet with the heads of major studios.

3761	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton continued the battle to win the Democratic presidential nomination, with record turnouts in the North Carolina and Indiana primaries Tuesday.
3762	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Voters lined up before sunrise in the capital of the midwestern state of Indiana, where the first polling stations opened at 6:00 am (1100 GMT) under overcast skies.
3763	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The day's voting closes in North Carolina at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT), with a combined total of 187 pledged delegates on offer in the two states.
3764	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Pre-election polls showed Obama leading in North Carolina while Clinton appeared to have the edge in Indiana.
3765	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Judging by numbers, Obama is the Democratic front-runner so far, as he leads in pledged delegates and is also ahead in the popular vote.
3766	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	However, he has also been unable to force Clinton out of the race.
3767	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	If Obama can take both states, he will strengthen his advantage over Clinton and influence the superdelegates who will ultimately decide who will represent the Democratic Party in November's presidential election.
3768	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Clinton needs to at least take Indiana to stay in the race.
3769	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The Clinton camp admits she cannot overtake Obama in pledged delegate count, and is therefore pinning her hopes on persuading nearly 800 superdelegates, who look set to have the deciding vote, to choose her as the presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention in August.
3770	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	A rolling average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com gives Obama 1,491 pledged delegates from all the races so far to Clinton's 1,337.
3771	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Neither can reach the winning line of 2,025 without backing from the superdelegates -- party officials free to vote either way.
3772	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	North Carolina and Indiana will also hold Republican presidential primaries Tuesday.
3773	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, is expected to pull in the majority of votes in what will be relatively light turnouts for Republicans.
3774	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	US lawmaker offers bill restoring military draft
3775	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	A top Democratic lawmaker on Thursday reintroduced legislation to restore the US military draft, saying that the all-volunteer army is shorthanded and overwhelmed by current and future troop deployments in Iraq.
3776	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	Representative Charles Rangel said a draft would spread out the human cost of the four-year-long Iraq operation, which he has said has been borne disproportionately by lower- and middle-class Americans.
3777	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	The New York lawmaker said the burden was likely to be even greater if US President George W. Bush makes good on his plan to increase US troops in Iraq by more than 20,000, as part of his plan to subdue the raging insurgency there.
3778	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"If Americans are to be placed in harm's way, all of us, from every income group and position in society, must share the burden of war," Rangel said.
3779	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of our troops fighting in Iraq are young men and women who have chosen to enlist because military service is an economic opportunity," Rangel said.
3780	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"They are motivated by enlistment bonuses up to 40,000 dollars and additional thousands in scholarships to attend college.
3781	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	They are from urban and rural communities where there is high unemployment and few opportunities to pursue the American Dream," said Rangel.
3782	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"It is time that all Americans -- including the wealthy -- be given the opportunity to prove their patriotism as well, by saluting when the flag goes up and defending their country in wartime.
3783	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	A military draft would ensure that."
3784	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	Rangel first proposed legislation for the draft in January 2003 before the invasion of Iraq two months later, but it was voted down.
3785	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	He again failed to win support when he reintroduced the bill last year.
3786	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	The United States has heavily depended on military reserves to keep up staffing levels in Iraq, where more than 3,000 US soldiers have died, and many soldiers have been pushed into multiple tours because of the shortage of fresh troops.
3790	XIN_ENG_20080206.0053.LDC2009T13	The explosion occurred at the entrance of Yuksekova town of Hakkari province late Tuesday night and two police officers were wounded, concerned officials were quoted as saying.

3792	XIN_ENG_20080206.0053.LDC2009T13	The explosion was caused by a remotely detonated bomb that was planted on the road side, said the officials.
3796	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari arrived Saturday for his second visit since the junta violently suppressed anti-government demonstrations in September.
3797	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The day before his arrival in Yangon, the isolated Southeast Asian nation's largest city, the junta announced it planned to expel the top U.N. diplomat in the country, adding an extra hurdle to the envoy's already difficult mission.
3798	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	After a brief stopover in Yangon, Gambari flew to Naypyitaw to meet with senior leaders, Myanmar government officials said, requesting anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to the media.
3799	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	It was not known which leaders would meet him in Naypyitaw, 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of Yangon, where the generals have established a new capital in a remote area nestled in mountain jungles, or whether he would later be allowed to visit detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon.
3801	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The military has said 10 people were killed in the crackdown, but diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is much higher.
3803	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta gave foreign diplomats and U.N. representatives a note saying the government did not intend to continue Petrie's assignment in the country.
3804	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.N. said in a statement that Gambari met with Petrie after his arrival and would "stay in Myanmar as long as necessary to accomplish his mission."
3805	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari carried a message of support for Petrie from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as well as one to junta head Senior Gen. Than Shwe, it said.
3806	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari was earlier dispatched to Myanmar after the government crackdown, meeting with Than Shwe as well as twice with Suu Kyi.
3807	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	But little of substance has changed on Myanmar's political scene since, and analysts expect that little will result from Gambari's current visit.

3809	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	It's the only game in town, but it's a game," said David Steinberg, a Myanmar expert from Georgetown University who visited the country last month and met with ministerial-level officials.
3810	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The United Nations has attempted to bring about reconciliation for almost two decades.
3814	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	This is a matter of life or death but so far the U.N. and the world have only come up with words," said Kar Kar Pancha, a Yangon businessman who fled to the Thai border.
3816	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	She said the U.N. envoy will convey to Myanmar's rulers the secretary-general's "very strong" support for the U.N. leadership in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
3817	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari has been on a six-nation Asian tour urging support from key countries for national reconciliation, a stepped-up transition to democracy, and the release of all detained demonstrators.
3818	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.S. and other Western countries shun the junta for its poor human rights record and failure to hand over power to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi's party after it won national elections in 1990.

3822	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The Rift Valley Fever disease has claimed two more lives at the Sangailu dispensary and Garissa Provincial General Hospital in Kenya's North Eastern Province, raising the death toll to 52, Kenya News Agency reported Monday.
3824	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Addressing the press on Monday, North Eastern Provincial Medical Officer of Health Ahmed Omar said that one death has occurred at Sangailu dispensary while patients from Bilbil in Tana River District in Coast Province succumbed to the disease at the Garissa Provincial General Hospital last night.
3826	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Three of the four new cases are recorded in Ijara while the other is from Garissa District.

3829	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Rift Valley Fever is endemic in Africa, naturally occurring in livestock but occasionally affecting humans.
3830	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Animals are infected with the virus by the Aedes mosquito.
3831	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The disease, characterized by bleeding from all orifices, is spread to humans in a number of ways: from infected mosquitoes
3832	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	through contact with blood or other body fluids
3833	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	or from the organs of infected animals.
3834	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Symptoms of the disease include fever, general weakness and malaise, cough and diarrhoea, with severe cases progressing to show facial swelling and bleeding from the orifices.
3835	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) of Rift Valley Fever varies from two to six days.
3836	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The fever mainly occurs following periods of heavy rainfall.
3837	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	In 1998, an outbreak claimed at least 200 lives in the North Eastern Province following the El Nino rains.

3840	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
3841	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Allstate Texas Lloyds is raising home insurance rates 5.9 percent statewide, the company said Monday.
3842	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Coastal residents in counties once and twice removed from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Harris and Montgomery counties, will also see an additional average 2 percent rate hike.
3843	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	That's to help cover the cost of reinsurance, or insurance the company buys for itself to help pay for claims in the event of a catastrophe, the company said.
3844	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Residents of Galveston County and a sliver of Harris County will not be hit with the average 2 percent increase because the company dropped windstorm coverage in counties that touch coastal waters last year.
3845	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The rates will change on policies as they come up for renewal, Allstate said.
3846	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rising construction costs also contributed to the rate hike, the company said.
3847	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	About 700,000 of Allstate's 917,000 Texas policyholders are insured by Allstate Texas Lloyds.
3848	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Allstate withdrew a proposed 6.9 percent statewide increase in homeowners rates after the Texas Department of Insurance signaled that it wouldn't approve rates.
3849	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"Updated information indicated a slightly reduced rate change," said Bill Mellander, a spokesman for Allstate.
3850	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The range of rates coastal residents will pay was not available, he said.
3851	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies in Texas are allowed to implement their rate increases upon filing them with regulators without prior approval.
3852	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	However, regulators can disapprove the rates after they've been implemented and order refunds.
3853	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rod Bordelon, of the Texas Office of Public Insurance Counsel that represents consumers, said he anticipates the office will oppose the rates.
3854	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"I see no basis for any such increase," said Bordelon, the public counsel.
3855	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"We're still looking at it."
3856	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Jerry Hagins, the spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said Monday his office is reviewing the actuarial information to see if the hike is justified.

3864	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola took the helm on Wednesday of the oil cartel OPEC at a time when plunging crude prices are casting a shadow over the previously glowing prospects of Africa's fastest growing economy.
3865	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	The resurgence of the southern African nation, which was devastated by a 27-year civil war, has been almost entirely dependent on its oil output which accounts for a staggering 90 percent of revenue.
3866	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola is OPEC's newest member, only joining in 2007, and sees its year-long presidency as a chance to forge a new image for a country more usually associated with conflict.
3867	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"For us it's very important to associate with this prestigious institution and for Angola to play a very important role on the price of oil in the context of the financial crisis," said Ambassador Nelson Cosme, director for Africa and the Middle East, at Angola's foreign ministry.
3868	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola has overtaken Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, pumping around two million barrels per day, and is now the biggest supplier to China.
3869	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Months of high oil prices, which hit a peak of 147 dollars a barrel in July, led the ruling party to announce ambitious spending plans ahead of parliamentary elections in September such as building one million new homes.
3870	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	But with price having now slumped to around 45 dollars a barrel, the government has had to revise its 2008 growth forecast from 20 percent to 16 percent and begin to eat into its reserves.
3871	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Economy Minister Manuel Junior said last week that the government may have to rethink its 42 billion dollar spending plans for 2009 if oil prices continue to stagnate.
3872	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Should there be the need for a revision of the state budget due to the drop of the oil price in the world market that will be done next year," Junior said in parliament.
3873	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	This spending plan is essential for the reconstruction of a nation decimated by the civil war which ended in 2002, with 70 percent of the population still living on less than two dollars a day, according to the World Bank.
3874	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	There are also fears that lower oil prices will lead to a slowdown in investment in Angola's oil industry which could have a knock-on effect on training and jobs.
3875	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Salim Abdul, a Luanda-based analyst, said that Angola found itself in the same boat as many countries that were so heavily reliant on oil revenue.
3876	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Many members of OPEC need oil to go up because they have calculated their budgets based on high oil prices," he told AFP.
3880	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	A formal announcement was expected later after Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Nuaimi said the cartel had agreed to a record cut of two million barrels a day, representing nearly 10 percent of daily output.
3881	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Justino Pinto de Andrade, director of economics at Luanda's Catholic University, said Angola still had every reason to count its blessings as its oil wealth had transformed the country's image from that of a perpetual vicim.
3882	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Angola is a player -- and it's a player because of oil.

3909	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"We think the game is over for Northern Rock in its present form," a Merrill analyst, John-Paul Crutchley, wrote in a note to investors.
3910	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The specter of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also sparked a raft of questions about whether the robust British economy -- supported in large part by a heated housing market --" would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
3911	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The pound fell below $2 for the first time in nearly three weeks.
3912	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British economic growth.
3915	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices and fueled speculation in the real estate market.
3916	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only days after refusing to inject liquidity into cash-starved financial markets on the basis that such action encouraged "excessive risk-taking."
3917	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	So far, assurances from the Northern Rock chief executive, Adam Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of England, have failed to impress depositors.
3918	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	In a bid to shore up confidence, Darling announced Monday that the government would guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other troubled financial institution that approached the government.
3920	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some of those waiting in line to retrieve their savings Monday blamed what they called lax standards at both U.S. and British mortgage lenders for the shortage of funds at Northern Rock.
3921	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"We had to go through a lengthy process to get a mortgage that was barely more than we earned, and now my son's girlfriend can get double that with hardly any income," said one customer, who declined to give his name but said he planned to withdraw his entire savings of more than 100,000 pounds.
3922	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"That's just not right."

3925	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw her money after watching the morning news and seeing new lines forming at the bank branches.
3926	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"I hate to take out the money, but I just don't want to risk anything," she said, adding that she did not yet know what she would do with it.
3927	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Troubles at Northern Rock filled the top headlines in the British press, further spreading nervousness.
3929	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"People are mortified and if savers are continuing to withdraw funds, a sale or split up becomes more likely," said Christine Ross, head of financial planning at SG Hambros in London.
3931	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Jonathan Pierce, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse in London, said that the most likely scenario for Northern Rock was a sale to another bank either "as a business or division of assets."
3933	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	Some customers, including Mays, wished they had the nerves to keep some savings with Northern Rock and wait for the bank to be bought.
3934	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"There was speculation that whoever buys it could offer incentives for customers to leave their money in there," Mays said.
3935	NYT_ENG_20070917.0130.LDC2009T13	"But the thing is, you just don't know."

3945	XIN_ENG_20070131.0263.LDC2009T13	According to him, a taboo had been broken and his organization was committed to working towards the realization of peace and reconciliation.
3946	XIN_ENG_20070131.0263.LDC2009T13	Last December, Gbagbo had called for "direct dialogues" with the NF rebels who are in control of the north of the country since a failed coup attempt in Sept. 2002, so as to revive the peace process in the country.

3963	XIN_ENG_20070109.0332.LDC2009T13	According to the KPC, despite an rising tendency in the past a few weeks, the Kuwaiti crude oil price still settled below 50 dpb, a mark it had maintained in the year of 2006.

3965	XIN_ENG_20070109.0332.LDC2009T13	International oil prices witnessed a swift retreat from 80 dpb to 50 dpb due to geopolitical and technical factors, KPC said.

4043	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Investigators said most of the victims were from the Kauhajoki area, like Saari, meaning he probably knew them.
4045	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"He left at home a message saying he wanted to murder as many people as possible.
4047	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Police spokesman Urpo Lintula said Saari had acquired a permit for his weapon, a .22-caliber handgun, in August.

4049	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said panic erupted at the school, which offers courses in catering, tourism, nursing and home economics, as the masked gunman entered just before 11 a.m. and started firing in a classroom where students were taking an exam.

4060	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	The two also discussed climate change -- the core issue at a weekend summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
4061	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's meeting with Howard comes a day after the Australian leader spent a day hosting U.S. President George W. Bush.
4063	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Among agreements signed by their entourages was one for Woodside Petroleum Ltd. to supply liquefied natural gas to state-run PetroChina Co. -- a deal worth up to 35 billion Australian dollars (US$28.8 billion euro21 billion), Howard said.
4064	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	China agreed to donate two pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australia.
4065	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard, in remarks to a conference of business executives, noted that Australia was in its 16th straight year of economic expansion and credited China's explosive emergence as contributing to it.
4066	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"China's growth is undeniably good for the world.
4067	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	It has been undeniably good for Australia," Howard said.
4068	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Taking the podium after him, Hu echoed Howard, saying, "China's sound and steady economic growth has not only benefited China's 1.3 billion people, but also offered enormous business opportunities to other countries."
4069	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's visit was not friction-free.
4070	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu was pressed by reporters on a string of recalls and import bans on Chinese products and foods badly made or tainted with toxic substances.
4071	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On climate change, Howard is seeking a strong endorsement for a new approach to global warming from the leaders at the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
4072	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu, however, only reiterated China's stock position -- that while global warming is a problem, it is largely the fault and responsibility of already industrialized nations.
4073	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	In an indirect slap at Howard's agenda for APEC, Hu said he hoped that the summit's declaration would note that U.N.-sponsored talks "should remain the main channel" for the international efforts to tackle climate change.
4075	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, Bush and Howard announced an agreement to give Australian businesses access to U.S. defense contracts.
4076	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard is due to hold security talks on Saturday with U.S. President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a meeting that Beijing has already criticized as being insufficiently transparent.
4077	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Asked by reporters if the Australia-U.S.-Japan dialogue represented a threat to China, Hu said the countries involved were better able to explain their intentions.
4079	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"The trilateral dialogue between Australia, Japan and the U.S. is not directed at anyone, anymore than the strategic dialogue I have just announced between Australia and China is not directed at anyone," Howard said.
4080	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Officials have not elaborated on the particular security concerns Australia, Japan and the U.S. will address, beyond saying they were issues of common interest.

4678	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Future of Solomons PM uncertain after defections
4680	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The breakaway group, which includes deputy prime minister Toswell Kaua, have petitioned the Solomon Islands governor general to convene parliament for a vote of no-confidence in Sogavare's government.
4681	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The group claimed Sunday it has majority support in the 48-member parliament of the impoverished South Pacific nation of 500,000.
4682	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"We have 28 MPs including nine ministers and 17 opposition (legislators)," one of its leaders, former minister Gordon Darcy Lilo, told local reporters.
4683	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Other legislators who previously supported Sogavare are also believed to have switched sides and the breakaway group say they expect their numbers to swell further.
4684	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has been shrouded in controversy since coming to power in April last year after riots destroyed dozens of businesses owned by ethnic Chinese and forced the resignation of his unpopular predecessor Snyder Rini.
4689	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The split was prompted by the sacking last week of finance minister Lilo after he refused to comply with pressure to fire the board of troubled national carrier Solomon Airlines.
4691	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Lilo rejected the allegations as "made up stories".
4692	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	He said the defectors had pulled out of the government because of concerns over the country's leadership, including Sogavare's decision to boycott the recent Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Tonga.
4693	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"If this country gets in trouble where will we run to?"
4696	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	Sogavare has been in a long-running confrontation with Australia since he expelled the Australian ambassador last year and Canberra tried to extradite Solomons Attorney General Julian Moti on child sex charges.
4697	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The rebels said they would decide through consensus their candidate to take over as prime minister.
4698	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	"We want a leadership that listens to the people," said Lilo.
4699	AFP_ENG_20071111.0019.LDC2009T13	The rebels said they would review the appointment of Moti, with opposition leader Fred Fono saying he should be repatriated to Australia to face the child sex charges.

4713	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	ANALYSIS: MANY EPISCOPALIANS WARY, SOME DEFIANT AFTER ULTIMATUM BY ANGLICANS
4714	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There was a time when the Episcopal Church in the United States was known as "the Republican Party at prayer," but in the last 30 years it has evolved into the Rainbow Coalition of Christianity.
4715	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are hip-hop Masses, Native American rituals to install a new presiding bishop and legions of gay and straight priests who don the rainbow stoles of gay liberation.
4716	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Its pews are full of Roman Catholics and Christians from other traditions attracted by its aura of radical acceptance.
4717	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Now the conservatives who numerically dominate the global Anglican Communion have handed their Episcopal branch in the United States an ultimatum that requires the church to reel in the rainbow if it wants to remain a part of the Communion.
4718	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	With a communique issued in Tanzania on Monday after a five-day meeting, the leaders of Anglican provinces around the world (known as primates) asked the U.S. branch to bar gays from becoming bishops, and to stop official blessings of same-sex unions.
4719	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.
4720	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There is no certainty at all that Episcopal leaders will now comply.
4721	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance.
4723	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"Being part of the Anglican Communion is very important to me," said Bishop Mark S. Sisk of New York.
4729	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In her "reflections," Jefferts Schori struck a tone of respect for those on both sides: "Both parties hold positions that can be defended by appeal to our Anglican sources of authority -- scripture, tradition, and reason -- but each finds it very difficult to understand and embrace the other."
4730	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	She suggested that the struggle for equality for gay men and lesbians would eventually prevail, just as the slaves in Africa were eventually freed -- an occasion she and the other primates commemorated last Sunday at a ceremony at the Cathedral in Zanzibar, the site of a former slave-trading market.
4731	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori concluded by noting that Lent is about to begin, and said that both sides in this conflict are being asked to undergo a "season of fasting
4732	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	" the liberals from blessing same- sex unions and consecrating gay bishops, and the conservative primates from "transgressing diocesan boundaries," which is what happened when some primates from Africa, Asia and Latin America recently tried taking control of conservative parishes in the United States that elected to leave the Episcopal Church.
4734	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique recommends that the Episcopal Church establish new positions of authority, a council and a "primatial vicar," who will have oversight of the conservatives within the Episcopal Church, so they do not have to turn to primates from other countries.
4736	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
4737	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	But already there were questions from Episcopalians who said that such significant decisions as a moratorium on gay bishops and blessings, and the creation of a council and "primatial vicar" could not be taken by the House of Bishops alone, but by the General Convention of the Episcopal Church, which includes lay and clergy delegates.
4740	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Some liberals on Tuesday were latching onto what they saw as a loophole because the wording specifies that the bishops will not authorize rites.
4741	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are many bishops who have not formally authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless allow priests to perform them.
4742	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	If this is all the communique is requiring, they suggested, the Episcopal Church can live with that.
4747	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to make people choose between the Communion and the church's commitment to gay and lesbian people," said the Rev. Michael Hopkins, a priest in Rochester, N.Y., and the former president of Integrity, a long-established organization of gay and lesbian Episcopalians.
4748	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Although the Episcopal Church is known as an inclusive haven, Hopkins said, he already knows gay men and lesbians who are leaving.

4789	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The successor to the East German Communist Party won representation in the legislature of the northern city of Hamburg on Sunday, confirming a leftward political shift across Germany.
4790	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The results, after a similar outcome in two state elections in January, come amid an increasingly sharp conflict in Germany about whether the former Communists, known as the Left Party, would be a viable political partner in Hamburg and elsewhere in Germany.
4791	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	That dispute, in turn, is worsening already fractious relations between the two large parties of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government in Berlin.
4792	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	Though a tiny slice of the German political landscape, Hamburg has in the past few weeks taken on an outsized importance as a test case for whether Germans, weary of years of belt-tightening economic restructuring, would drive the political center of gravity further left.
4793	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The vote on Sunday confirmed the trend, with the Left Party winning 6.5 percent of the vote, according to German public television's preliminary exit polls.

4795	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The Social Democrats, the pillar of Germany's center-left, won 34.1 percent.
4796	NYT_ENG_20080224.0180.LDC2009T13	The Left Party, a combination of former Communists, disillusioned Social Democrats and western radicals, won enough votes last month in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony to win parliamentary representation.

4861	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	How much more, one wonders, can Detroit take?
4863	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"We've been through enough around here."
4864	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Taylor, 59, was killing time at Campus Martius, a town-square- like meeting place in the heart of downtown.
4865	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Clad in a hooded gray sweatshirt and a leather jacket, he sipped hot chocolate near the area's festively decorated 65-foot Norway spruce tree.
4867	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"From our restaurants to the hair salons to the shoeshine parlors, the fall of the automakers will affect us all one way or another."
4868	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	James Greenwood, 54, a former auto plant worker taking a break from his job as a maintenance worker at nearby Cobo Center, where the North American International Auto Show will be held this winter, huddled with friends around the Campus Martius ice skating rink.
4870	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"I thought they would help the industry because they should know how many people would be affected if they didn't," Greenwood said with a mixture of fatalism and hope.
4871	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"We've been suffering here for a long time now," he said, but in the next breath he held out hope that automakers would get some financial relief from the Treasury and the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.
4872	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"You never know," Greenwood said, turning his collar up against the freezing temperature, "somebody in Washington could come to their senses.
4873	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	They could get enough to get through this year.
4874	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	In the long run, though, I think they'll punt it to Obama."
4875	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Latrice Jackson, however, had little sympathy for Detroit's automakers, or its workers.
4876	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"I just feel like we all need to buckle down, and stop being so greedy," said Jackson, who lives in suburban Ferndale and takes care of her disabled brother.
4877	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"The companies should have seen all of this coming, but they brought it on themselves.
4878	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	And a lot of the workers, well, we all have to learn to get by with less.
4879	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	We need to stop hoarding things, and take better care of our money."
4880	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Across the street, the popular 91-year-old American Coney Island restaurant was doing brisk business, with folks streaming in to take refuge from the cold, and to talk about the car industry.
4881	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"Honey, the Big Three is Detroit," a waitress, Cindy Williams, 46, said.
4882	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"We get all kinds of business from auto workers.

4884	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Donald J. Andrews, having lunch near steamy windows with a table of friends, said the Senate's action "was a big mistake" that would have severe consequences.
4885	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	"As far as I'm concerned, the automotive industry is the arsenal of democracy," said Andrews, 43, a lawyer from Waterford, about a half-hour drive from here.
4886	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Another lawyer, Jeffrey Schwartz, 53, of the suburb of West Bloomfield, was incredulous that, as he put it, "the government is for bankers and Wall Street, and then makes the decision not to support this industry."
4887	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	The restaurant's general manager, Dan Keros, agreed that it was the government's job to lend the auto industry a hand.

4890	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Overhearing the conversation, a well-known community activist, Malik Shabazz, 46, yelled from a nearby table, "Bail out the people, not the banks!"
4891	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	Between bites of a trademark Detroit chili dog -- a steamed hot dog slathered with onions, chili and mustard -- Shabazz went on:

4894	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	But the car companies, man, they had to do flips, and they didn't get a dime."
4895	NYT_ENG_20081212.0159.LDC2009T13	A local sports radio station dedicated the entire day to "standing up" for the auto industry with messages of hope from people like Detroit's new mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., and other politicians.

4912	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks before general elections, a suicide bomber pierced her security cordon to shoot her in the neck as she left a campaign rally.

4914	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	The powerful blast tore off limbs and shredded clothes.
4915	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Many people ran in panic, screaming as they trampled over pieces of human flesh.
4916	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Puddles of blood dotted the road.
4917	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"There was an enormous explosion, and then I saw body parts flying through the air," said Mirza Fahin, a professor at a local college.

4919	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	I have never seen anything so horrible in my life -- just parts of human beings, flesh, lying in the road."
4920	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	The slaying horrified world leaders who appealed for calm and warned that extremists must not be allowed to destabilise the nuclear-armed nation before the January 8 vote.
4921	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush called it a "cowardly act" and telephoned his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf -- a crucial ally in the US-led "war on terror" against Islamic extremism -- to discuss the crisis.
4922	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Unrest broke out across Pakistan as mobs of protesters torched buildings, trucks and shops, blocked roads and uprooted rail tracks.
4923	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Two people were shot dead in rioting in the eastern city of Lahore and another two were killed in southern Sindh province.
4924	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Police and paramilitary forces were put on the highest "red alert" level.
4925	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Musharraf, who announced three days of national mourning, urged people to remain peaceful "so that the evil designs of terrorists can be defeated."
4926	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	But the attack raises questions about whether the election can go ahead, as well as speculation that Musharraf may re-impose the emergency rule he ended earlier this month.
4927	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Nawaz Sharif, another former premier and Bhutto's biggest political rival, said he would boycott the election and urged Musharraf to resign to "save" the country.

4929	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing, but Bhutto had previously accused elements in the intelligence services of trying to kill her and said she had also received death threats from Islamic militant groups including Al-Qaeda.
4930	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	"The attacker fired and then blew himself up," said one police official who asked not to be named.

4933	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Her father, also a prime minister, was hanged by the military in 1979 after being ousted from power.
4934	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Educated at Oxford and Harvard, Bhutto's return here in October after eight years of self-exile brought hopes of a power-sharing deal with Musharraf.
4935	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	That optimism was quickly shattered.
4936	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	Her welcome home parade was hit in the deadliest terror attack in Pakistani history, killing 139 people, while her talks with Musharraf ended in acrimony after he declared emergency rule on November 3.
4937	AFP_ENG_20071227.0085.LDC2009T13	As Bhutto's husband Asif Zardari flew in from Dubai, sources said that her funeral was likely to take place Friday in Larkana, her home town deep in the rural south.

4953	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	Fillon also announced plans to stimulate the economy that include a drastic trimming of the civil servants corps.

4956	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	It will not replace the 22,700 civil servants who will be retiring -- nearly double the 12,000 who were not replaced this year, Fillon said.
4957	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The announcement was in line with the government's aim of replacing only one public employee for every two who retire in a bid to trim spending.

4960	APW_ENG_20070731.0993.LDC2009T13	The government's effort is up against the weight of France's debt service burden, which the prime minister said is rising due to higher interest rates.

5009	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	2nd Ld, Writethru: Japanese government nominates Tanami as new BOJ chief
5010	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	TOKYO, March 18 (Xinhua)
5011	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	The Japanese government on Tuesday nominated Koji Tanami, governor of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, as the new governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
5012	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	The nomination of Tanami, who previously served as vice finance minister between January 1998 and July 1999, came after the opposition-controlled upper house of parliament rejected the government's initial proposal last week.
5013	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	During the Diet meeting, the government also named former University of Tokyo professor Kiyohiko Nishimura, who is currently on the BOJ's Policy Board, as one of the two deputy governors of the central bank.
5014	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	Earlier Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura expressed his confidence that the proposal will be accepted by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), Japan's key opposition party.
5015	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	But Kenji Yamaoka, Diet affairs chief of the DPJ, told reporters that his party found it "quite difficult" to give consent to the fresh nomination of Tanami as the new BOJ Chief.
5016	XIN_ENG_20080317.0049.LDC2009T13	The five-year tenure of the current BOJ governor, Toshihiko Fukui, and his two deputies expires Wednesday.

5018	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-01-22 13:05:57 UTC
5019	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	A senior Israeli official said the Jewish state had been on the threshold of producing nuclear arms at least three decades ago, but he stopped short of confirming the widely-held -- though never confirmed -- belief that Israel has a nuclear arsenal today.
5020	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a security conference near Tel Aviv on Sunday, Ariel Levite, deputy head of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, recounted the history of world nuclear development and the creation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which limited the possession of nuclear weapons to those who had them before 1967.
5022	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	It was largely successful in putting the brakes on the nuclear race, he said, "but nevertheless there was some creeping forward, as a result of which three threshold states appeared, those who were outside the nuclear agreement, India, Pakistan and Israel."
5023	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Levite, who prefaced his remarks by saying they were his own opinion and not an official commission statement, did not specifically refer to any Israeli weapons, although India and Pakistan went on to become declared nuclear powers.
5024	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Contacted by The Associated Press on Monday, Levite said his remarks should not be interpreted as a policy statement nor as an indicator of Israel's past or present nuclear status.
5025	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	"I meant that, in terms of world perception, during that period, some were seen as closer (to a nuclear capacity) and some were further away, I'm not going into it any further than that," he said.
5029	APW_ENG_20070122.0704.LDC2009T13	Olmert said he had been misunderstood.

5031	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 2007-08-21 17:10:33 UTC
5032	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a hurricane.
5033	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The space shuttle swooped out of the partly cloudy sky and touched down on the runway at 12:32 p.m. (1632 GMT).
5034	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	"Congratulations.
5035	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Welcome home.
5040	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a damaged wing on shuttle Columbia had allowed hot gases to seep in during the re-entry, tearing the shuttle apart.
5041	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	There was zero chance of a Columbia-style catastrophe this time, NASA managers insisted, although they acknowledged re-entry was always risky.
5042	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that the spacecraft would hold up.
5045	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station visit short because of Hurricane Dean.
5046	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	At the time, NASA was uncertain if Dean would veer toward Texas and threaten Houston, home to Mission Control.
5047	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Even though forecasters later put Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.
5048	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	During Endeavour's liftoff on Aug. 8, a piece of foam insulation or ice had broken off a bracket on the external fuel tank, fell onto a strut lower on the tank and then bounced into the shuttle, gashing its tiles.
5049	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The astronauts inspected the especially vulnerable areas Sunday, after undocking from the international space station.
5050	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA on Monday cleared Endeavour for landing after engineers finished evaluating the latest laser images of the shuttle's wings and nose and concluded there were no holes or cracks from micrometeorites or space junk.
5051	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Brackets have shed debris in launches since Columbia, but it was not until Endeavour's flight that such debris caused noticeable damage again.
5053	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the problem is solved.
5054	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	For now, Discovery is supposed to lift off in late October.
5055	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	While in orbit, the astronauts attached a new truss segment to the space station and replaced a failed gyroscope needed for keeping the outpost headed in the right direction.
5057	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The crew completed four spacewalks, two of which were cut short.
5059	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The other was abbreviated to give the crew enough time to prepare for an early departure from the space station.
5060	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The rest of the crew includes pilot Charles Hobaugh and mission specialists Alvin Drew, Tracy Caldwell, Dave Williams and Rick Mastracchio.

5073	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Racing: Sydney's top race course under horse flu lockdown
5074	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	One of Australia's top racecourses was put under a strict lockdown Thursday after a racehorse tested positive for equine influenza, as the virulent bug appeared to spread to the thoroughbred industry.
5075	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Vets were urgently carrying out tests to confirm whether the horse at Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse was infected, but the initial outcome appeared to realise the racing industry's worst fears, officials said.
5076	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"We have taken a second test but the first one showed all the signs of being positive," Racing New South Wales chief executive Peter V'Landys said.
5077	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The previous tests have been accurate so we are holding little hope.
5078	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The test on the second sample will be expedited and we should know for certain later," he said.
5079	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It is such bad news."
5080	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Trainer Anthony Cummings said the suspect horse had an elevated temperature but he was hoping tests would still clear the animal of infection.
5081	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"I'm still hopeful there is an outside chance the test will come back negative," Cummings told Australian radio.
5082	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The symptoms are not present in him or the horses around him but we will wait and see."
5083	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The unprecedented outbreak of equine flu in Australia was first detected among recreational and pleasure horses a week ago, forcing a halt to all movements of horses across the country and a cancellation of all race meetings.
5084	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The outbreak has left the multi-billion dollar racing industry reeling and wiped millions in turnover from the major betting firms.
5085	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	But racing was expected to resume this weekend in all states apart from Queensland and New South Wales, where officials had hoped they could restart races in a limited form in the next couple of weeks.
5086	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	If the positive result for horse flu in a thoroughbred is confirmed, the racing calendar in New South Wales is likely to remain blank for some time, with experts predicting Randwick will be locked down for at least a month
5087	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian McDonald says the state's spring racing carnival, the premier event for the year, was is in jeopardy if equine influenza was confirmed among the thoroughbreds as Randwick.
5088	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It would then place the place under total quarantine, and there wouldn't be any possibility for racing for quite some time," McDonald told ABC radio.
5089	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Some 700 thoroughbreds are stabled at Randwick and trainer John O'Shea said the racing community was despondent about the prospect of a horse flu outbreak.
5091	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"My staff, myself and my owners, we live for the spring carnival.
5093	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"That's now been taken away from us and it's horribly unlikely that we'll be back racing in the next two to three months."
5094	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	There have even been reports that race organisers could saddle up camels or hold phantom meetings without spectators in a bid to satisfy punters unable to place a bet because of the ban.

5179	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"We have seen the announcement from Airbus and are now waiting to hear from them in detail about what the changes to their production schedule mean for deliveries of our aircraft down the line," SIA said.
5182	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The double-decker plane can carry 853 people.
5183	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The Airbus announcement confirms last week's report in the German business magazine Wirtschafts-Woche which said Airbus faced more production delays on the A380 super jumbo, the world's largest passenger aircraft.
5184	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	EADS shares fell sharply in the wake of that story.
5185	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The report said quality problems on components, and airline interior design requirements -- which make production more complex -- were causing difficulties.

5187	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's White House drive picked up pace Friday with more superdelegates rallying to his side, including the head of a leading union, as former rival John Edwards all but endorsed his campaign.
5188	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Since Obama's convincing win in North Carolina on Tuesday over rival Hillary Clinton and their photo-finish finale in Indiana, nine more of the Democratic Party elite with free votes on the nomination contest have swung over to the Illinois senator.
5189	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	The trickle of support is predicted to turn into a flood, with only six primaries now left in their marathon battle to carry the party's flag into the November presidential elections against Republican John McCain.
5190	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Edwards, who dropped out of the close race in late January, stopped short of endorsing Obama on Friday, but said he has virtually wrapped up the contest, ahead of the last primaries on June 3.
5191	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"Let's just assume that Barack is the nominee because it's headed in that direction," he told NBC television.
5192	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He added he thought Obama, who is on a historic quest to be the country's first black president, also had a "better chance" to beat McCain.
5193	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	While the former first lady had fought a good campaign, "the problem is the numbers," Edwards said, referring to the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the party's nomination.
5194	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who is also seeking to make history by being the first woman elected to the Oval Office, trails behind Obama in the number of pledged delegates to the party's nominating convention in August.
5195	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And while she still holds the lead in the number of superdelegates, whose vote will be decisive in who wins the party nomination, Obama is hot on her heels.
5196	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Independent pollsters RealClearPolitics.com on Friday put Obama ahead with 1,854 delegates, including 265 superdelegates, compared to 1,696 for Clinton, who has pocketed some 272 superdelegates.
5197	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	That leaves more than 250 superdelegates still uncommitted, at least publicly.
5198	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In a further blow to Clinton's White House hopes, another one of the party grandees defected from her side Friday.
5199	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs," Congressman Donald Payne told the Newark Star-Ledger.
5202	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama also picked up the support of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents some 600,000 government workers, and its president John Gage, who is also a superdelegate.
5204	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"We think the country needs change and we think now is the time."
5205	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He admitted it been an "excruciatingly hard" decision, but hoped the union's backing would help sway others and bring the party's longest ever nominating race to a swift end.
5206	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, however, has vowed no surrender and plunged straight back into campaigning before the May 13 primary in West Virginia, where she is favored in polls.
5207	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	On Friday she was in Oregon, which will hold its primary along with Kentucky on May 20.
5208	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he could declare victory after the May 20 primaries which may put him over the top, in terms of elected delegates.
5209	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In that event, "we can make a pretty strong claim that we have got the most runs and it's the ninth inning and we have won," Obama said Thursday, using a baseball analogy.
5211	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	At least 10 superdelegates escorted him out of one meeting, jostling to get into the camera shot with him, despite not having publicly announced their support.

5365	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The uranium enrichment uses centrifuges to make fuel for civilian nuclear reactors but can also be used to make material for bombs.
5366	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	It is at the heart of US charges that Iran is hiding work to develop nuclear weapons.
5367	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Tehran insists its programme is peaceful.
5369	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	"They might agree on some sort of framework or concept under which the Iranians will pull the plug on centrifuges for a couple of months" -- opening the door to wider talks including the United States -- and for the Security Council to take "no action for that period" on sanctions.
5370	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Moscow supports ElBaradei's "time-out" proposal.
5371	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	But diplomacy in Munich could be stilled by the long shadow of the United States, and perhaps hardline allies like Britain, which reject such simultaneity and want any Iranian enrichment pause to come first and be unconditional in order to keep Iran from winning additional time to continue strategic fuel work.
5372	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	US officials have pointed out that once Iran met its commitments to stop such fuel work, the Security Council would suspend its sanctions, as the resolution makes clear.
5373	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	But diplomats said some European states were at least playing with the idea of a face-saving solution along the lines of a "time-out" that fudges the need for Iran to unconditionally stand-down.
5374	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The Security Council could impose tougher sanctions if a report by ElBaradei later this month shows Tehran continuing to defy the Security Council, especially since Iran is pressing ahead with building an underground plant at Natanz for industrial-level uranium enrichment.
5375	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	The Munich meeting gathers international leaders in a framework that favours informal contacts.
5376	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, new US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who led the EU's stalled talks with Iran, will all be at the conference.
5377	AFP_ENG_20070209.0210.LDC2009T13	Non-proliferation analyst Mark Fitzpatrick, of the London think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: "Iran will be looking for a way to escape further sanctions" but he said that what Larijani "has to offer will likely fall short of the Security Council's resolution for a verified suspension."

5388	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	The president of the World Bank on Sunday urged immediate action to deal with rising food prices that have caused hunger and deadly violence in several countries.
5389	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	Robert Zoellick said the international community has "to put our money where our mouth is" and act now to help hungry people.
5390	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	"It is as stark as that."
5391	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	He called on goverments to rapidly carry out commitments to provide the U.N. World Food Program with $500 million (euro315.8 million) in emergency aid it said it needs by May 1.
5392	APW_ENG_20080413.0758.LDC2009T13	After a meeting of the bank's policy-setting committee, Zoellick said that the fall of the government in Haiti over the weekend after a wave of deadly rioting and looting over food prices underscores the importance of quick international action.

5396	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	US shares slumped Friday as interest rate jitters and fears about mortgage failures hitting the financial sector offset the splash from the Blackstone Group's debut on Wall Street.
5397	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 59.10 points (0.44 percent) to 13,486.74 and the Nasdaq shed 10.06 points (0.38 percent) to 2,606.90 at 1420 GMT.

5400	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Mark Fightmaster at Schaeffer's Investors Service said the market was under pressure as "the impact of subprime mortgages has crept back into the picture."
5401	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	He said this was highlighted by reports that Wall Street investment firm Bear Stearns was taking out 3.2 billion dollars in loans to keep creditors from seizing assets of its money- losing hedge funds hit by mortgage sector losses.
5402	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"In addition, some believe that the initial public offering (IPO) of private behemoth Blackstone Group could signal a market top," Fightmaster said.
5403	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	The private equity firm's share traded under the BX symbol shot higher to 45 dollars in electronic trades from 31 dollars after the biggest IPO so far this year, raising 4.1 billion dollars for the equity firm making its debut in the regulated stock market.
5404	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	In floor trading, Blackstone shares were up 18 percent from the offering price at 36.45 dollars.
5405	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Al Goldman, market strategist at AG Edwards, said he believes the subprime jitters have provided an excuse to sell but that the market needs to pause after the big runup of the past few months.
5406	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"We believe the subprime problems have been widely publicized and thus pretty well discounted," he said.
5407	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"The brake being applied on our bull (market) is simply its own internal dynamics and the internals are just a bit tired ... we look for more correction over the short term."

5409	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 5.197 percent from 5.163 percent Thursday and that on the 30-year bond increased to 5.318 percent against 5.284 percent.
5410	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
5411	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Among stocks in focus, Bear Stearns fell 97 cents to 144.84 dollars with investors watching how it will cope with the losses at its hedge funds from mortgage securities holding "subprime" loans.
5412	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the Wall Street bank appeared to be moving to avoid a "fire sale" of those assets.
5413	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"The mere mention of the term 'fire sale' puts the capital markets on edge, but the notion that a loan agreement of some sort is being worked out to prevent that is helping to calm some of the nervousness," he said.
5414	AFP_ENG_20070622.0308.LDC2009T13	"Nonetheless, the Bear Stearns hedge fund situation is providing a reality check for many investors that it is prudent to be more risk averse than they have been recently in their search for high yields."

5417	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	A private equity buyout of US medical device group Biomet Inc. was boosted to 11.4 billion dollars, the company said Thursday.

5421	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	"We believe the proposed price for the transaction is fair to Biomet's shareholders," Biomet chairman Niles Noblitt said.
5423	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	Moreover, this revised offer provides greater certainty and visibility to completion of the transaction."
5424	AFP_ENG_20070607.0369.LDC2009T13	The deal requires 75 percent of shareholders to accept the offer, which amounts to 46 dollars per share.

5430	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	WASHINGTON, Feb.16 - The seed-supply company that once prided itself on keeping the White House lawn green is in the red.
5431	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	When AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it put farmers at an even graver risk.
5432	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The bankruptcy has already caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture revenue nationwide.
5434	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By 1999, the company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
5438	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Crop farmers, who are already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic losses.
5439	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last two weeks.
5441	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Last February, ABT tried to solve their problem by hiring a new senior management group ``with expertise in operation and integration,'' and set goals to build company capitol, manage the acquired operations and achieve profit in 2000, according to a company profile.
5442	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
5444	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
5447	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Of the 13 states with contracted companies, Oregon and Washington have been hit the hardest, each seeking nearly $40 million in contract compensation alone.
5448	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Congressmen in Wyoming and Idaho have already asked for federal assistance.
5449	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the Idaho delegation wrote, ``be prepared to intervene with the appropriate emergency assistance for it will become apparent that the effects of this bankruptcy will force large numbers of seed farmers out of business.''
5450	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Though Wyoming farmers only lost $4.5 in contract money, the state will eventually require nearly $20 million to help stabilize the numerous communities effected by the ABT fiasco, according to state officials.

5462	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	North Korea said Saturday that at least 600 people are dead or missing following devastating floods, twice the previous official toll.
5463	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	Torrential rain, strong winds and landslides left at least 600 people dead or missing and thousands of people injured, the official Korean Central News Agency said, citing figures from the Central Statistics Bureau.
5464	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	Official figures quoted by relief agencies earlier spoke of about 300 dead or missing.
5465	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency, in its starkest assessment so far of the damage, said the downpours earlier this month "caused huge material losses to the (country), creating unprecedented difficulties in people's living and economic construction."
5466	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	It said the homes of at least 240,000 families were totally or partially destroyed or inundated, leaving at least 100,000 people totally homeless and some 900,000 others flood-stricken.
5467	AFP_ENG_20070825.0119.LDC2009T13	It said more than 8,000 public buildings, schools, thousands of health service institutions and nurseries were totally or partly destroyed, along with more than 1,000 major production facilities such as mine complexes and factories.

5531	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-01-17 01:28:51 UTC
5532	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Conservationists criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's decision to exempt the Navy from an environmental law so it can continue using high-power sonar in its training off California -- a practice they say harms whales and other marine mammals.
5533	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The president's action will not allow the anti-submarine warfare training to go forward because an injunction is in place, but the Navy believes it will significantly strengthen its argument in court.
5534	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
5535	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
5536	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East.
5537	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the United States" and its national security.
5539	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"I'm not surprised at all," he said.
5540	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"It's typical for this Republican administration to ignore environmental protections under the banner of fear."
5541	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and ears.
5542	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
5544	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises.
5545	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar would have to be shut down when mammals were spotted within 2,200 yards (2,010 meters).
5546	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
5548	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other marine mammals.
5549	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.
5550	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might threaten its ships.
5551	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"We cannot in good conscience send American men and women into potential trouble spots without adequate training to defend themselves," said Roughead.

5559	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The state's home insurer of last resort told state regulators Friday that a 25 percent increase in its base rate on Cape Cod would be a major step toward covering the company's costs, but added that it is receptive to offering premium reductions to consumers who install hurricane shutters and roof tie-downs or accept higher deductibles.
5560	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Massachusetts Fair Plan's rate request, which follows the approval of a similar-size increase in October, faced near-united opposition from the attorney general, several Cape lawmakers, and a number of homeowners who came from the Cape to testify.
5561	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	They called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic meltdown on the Cape.
5562	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"When you add the high cost of home insurance to the high cost of housing, you're going to cripple the market and eventually the state," said Harvey Baumann, a retired surgeon from Wellfleet.
5563	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
5565	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	These estimates have had a ripple effect throughout the insurance industry.
5566	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Reinsurers, the companies that insure insurance companies against catastrophic events, have raised their rates substantially.
5567	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
5569	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
5574	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Jack Golembeski, chief executive of the Fair Plan, said he averaged the damage forecasts of the two leading models in developing his company's proposed rates.
5575	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said the Fair Plan is seeking a 25 percent increase in its base rate on the Cape and islands, New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County except for Brockton.
5576	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said rates should be higher, but have been adjusted downward to prevent rate shock.
5577	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said the numbers indicate a 75 percent increase in New Bedford is warranted.
5580	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Other members of the insurance industry question the accuracy of the models, too.
5583	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"Rating agencies and the modelers themselves have more to lose by underestimating the risk in seldom-hit locations than overestimating it."

5590	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israeli security forces prevented two others from leaving Gaza.
5591	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We intend to continue to get as many people as possible out of Gaza over the next few days," Yassin said.
5593	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Gaza's border crossings closed since June, when the Islamic militant Hamas seized control of the territory.
5594	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a time.
5595	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
5597	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	His work visa in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of those allowed to leave.
5598	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Fawaz blamed Gaza's Hamas leadership and its rival, the moderate government of President Mahmoud Abbas, which rules the West Bank.
5599	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"Both are responsible for our suffering," Fawaz said.
5600	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The protest ended when Palestinian border officials promised that all of the about 5,000 Gazans still waiting to leave would be allowed out within 10 days.
5601	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We are pleased to learn that 250 people were (allowed to cross), but this is very minor number of people compared to the general population," said Noga Eitan, spokeswoman for the Gisha Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, an Israeli human rights group.

5619	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Brazilian international winger Robinho put Real ahead after just eight minutes but Enrique De Lucas equalised shortly after the interval.

5622	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Argentine centre-back Gaby Milito made the breakthrough on 63 minutes with a bullet header before teenage prodigy Bojan Krkic showed great composure to score two minutes later.

5627	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Argentine Lionel Messi completed the scoring late on with his eighth goal of the campaign.

5632	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Robinho, keeping Dutch winger Arjen Robben out of the side, headed Real ahead after just eight minutes with his third goal in two games but they failed to build on the perfect start.
5635	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Barcelona went into their match with criticism ringing in their ears after former favourite Edmilson, now at Chelsea, claimed there were several black sheep in the dressing room and that some of his former team-mates were slacking in training.

5643	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	A small bomb exploded on a beach in the popular southern Spanish resort town of Torremolinos early Tuesday in an attack blamed on the Basque separatist group ETA.
5645	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"This was an ETA bomb," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told a news conference, adding he did not think this meant the outfit had a "stable structure" in the southern Andalucia region which is popular with sunseekers.
5646	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	The explosion happened just after midnight (2200 GMT Monday) on a crowded seafront close to the Aloha Puerto hotel, a police spokesman told AFP.
5647	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	Cadena Ser radio said the device contained one kilogram (about two pounds) of explosives.
5648	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"There was a lot of dust," the owner of a beachfront restaurant located near the site of the blast, Rafael Sanchez, told reporters.

5650	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	There were people who were left dizzy or crying and mothers who removed their children from the area," he added.
5651	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	ETA regularly targets Spain's key tourism industry with small explosions at resorts during the summer holiday season as part of its 40-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland which has so far killed 823 people.
5653	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	"It's a clear attempt at causing alarm and trying to disrupt the tourist interests of Andalucia," said Torremolinos mayor Pedro Fernandez Montes.

5663	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	But an ETA bombing at Madrid's airport in December 2006 that killed two men put an end to tentative peace talks with the government and in June 2007 the outfit formally called off its ceasefire.

5673	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-12-13 20:28:33 UTC
5675	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The House passed the short-term funding bill by a 385-27 vote
5677	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments whose budgets have yet to pass.
5679	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats announced Wednesday they would all but surrender to President George W. Bush's demand that lawmakers appropriate no more than $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) for annual operating expenses for Cabinet departments whose budgets are set each year by Congress.
5680	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of the politically sacrosanct program.
5682	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Differences over Iraq and whether to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still to be resolved.
5684	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House was quick to say it had not signed on to the Democrats' measure, awaiting details of the bill's final cost, the funding mix within accounts, and the resolution of its request for additional Iraq and Afghanistan war funds.
5686	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
5688	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But with the White House playing such a strong hand in the negotiations, Boehner now insists Democrats stick within the president's $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) figure, with exceptions for border security and a few other "emergencies."
5690	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The bill will not carry Iraq aid when passing the House next week, though Democrats have said they will attach about $30 billion (euro20.4 billion) for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and some domestic Pentagon needs.
5691	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps months of wrangling.
5692	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23 billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the funding to increases for domestic programs such as health research, education, grants to state and local governments and energy research.
5693	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	More recently, Democrats worked with pragmatic appropriations panel Republicans such as Sen. Thad Cochran and Rep. James Walsh to craft a split-the-differences bill cutting $11 billion (euro7.4 billion) from the earlier Democratic measures.
5694	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat Saturday.
5695	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Now, lawmakers led by House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey and his Senate counterpart Robert Byrd, both Democrats, are squeezing the remaining funding bills by another 1.6 percent, said a Byrd spokesman.
5697	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Under Bush's budget, domestic Cabinet departments other than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would see their budgets frozen.
5698	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Considering inflation and population gains, that means most programs would not be able to deliver a comparable level of services next year as they do now.

5712	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Relevant government agencies have been working on programs to help more women find employment or open their own business, so as to meet strong demand for manpower in many sectors, CEPD officials said.
5713	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Generally speaking, getting married and having children are the two major factors most affecting women's willingness to work, the officials said, adding that when sound social systems are in place, and society grants them equal rights, women will be better able to take care of their families and work at the same time.
5714	CNA_ENG_20070614.0043.LDC2009T13	Against such a background, the issue of how to take advantage of women's power to contribute to the workforce has been one of the focal points in the government's human resources policy, which aims to create more job opportunities for women and fully explore their workplace capabilities, the officials said.
5719	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	The ads, running on Spanish-language television and radio in states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, feature Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain pointing fingers at each other for not having done enough on immigration.
5720	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
5722	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	And so ensued a series of ongoing volleys on an issue that, until eclipsed by rising concerns over the economic meltdown, had retained national interest.
5723	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
5725	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Immigration has been complicated, heated and polarizing," explained Audrey Singer, immigration policy analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. "Definitely not what you want to talk about in the last couple of weeks of the election."
5726	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State University in San Marcos.
5727	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	It's niche political advertising taken to a higher strategic level because it's only in Spanish, noted Subervi, director of the university's Center for the Study of Latino Media and Markets.
5728	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Through these attack ads, they've found a safe way to make their case on who's the best candidate for Latinos," Subervi said.
5729	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"They've found a common denominator that's not offensive to the broader public."
5731	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Federico de Jesus, spokesman for Obama, said McCain started it all by issuing Spanish ads smearing Obama's record on immigration -- and the Obama camp was forced to respond in kind.
5733	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"We don't have anything to fear or hide," he said.
5735	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.
5736	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Their views on the economy, health care, education and national security are just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.

5752	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	A senior US official will visit Syria in the coming weeks to discuss the problem of Iraqi refugees, the State Department said Thursday in a new sign of a possible thaw between Washington and Damascus.
5753	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbrey will travel to Damascus along with an official of the UN refugee agency as part of a regional tour dealing with "humanitarian issues related to Iraqi refugees in those countries," said department spokesman Sean McCormack.
5754	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	Sauerbrey and the UN High Commmisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative will also visit Jordan and possibly other states "in coming weeks," he said.
5755	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	The United States withdrew its ambassador from Damascus after Syria was implicated in the February 2005 assassination in Beirut of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri.
5756	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	The administration of President George W. Bush has since refused high-level contacts with Syria, which it accuses of backing anti- US insurgents in neighboring Iraq and efforts by the Lebanese Islamic movement Hezbollah to topple the Western-backed government of Lebanon.
5757	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	But in a sudden policy shift, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced this week that she and other US officials would join their Syrian and Iranian counterparts at conferences on Iraq's future in the coming weeks.
5758	AFP_ENG_20070301.0452.LDC2009T13	McCormack has refused to rule out bilateral contacts with Syrian and Iranian officials on the sidelines of those meetings, but insisted these could only deal with Iraq-related issues and not the myriad other disputes between Washington and the two states.

5761	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	In its hunt for slogans to lure tourists, the nation's capital has never lit on the elegance of a "Virginia Is for Lovers" or the panache of a "What Happens Here, Stays Here."
5762	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"A Capital City" was fine for awhile, until Washington's high murder rate in the late 1980s produced an unwanted double meaning.
5763	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	And while residents lined up for "Taxation Without Representation" license plates in 2000, that tagline was more local protest than tourist come-on.
5764	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	This time, the District of Columbia is taking a more studious approach.
5767	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This isn't a few people sitting around a room saying, 'Hey, let's come up with this slogan,"' said Dan Mesches, president of Star Restaurant Group and chairman of the city's Brand Strategy Task Force, a panel of local leaders in business, travel and the arts.
5768	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This is an extensive and exhaustive search for what people in town are thinking and what people out of town are thinking."
5771	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"Mistakes Were Made," "Where Attorneys Roam" and "Dude, Where's My Car?"
5773	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said he wanted a catchphrase that braids the themes of "unity, energy and renaissance."
5774	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"You want to have a slogan where people just say, 'That's what I think about when I think about the nation's capital,"' said Fenty, 36, who took office in January as the city's youngest mayor.
5775	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"We want it to touch people.
5776	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	We want it to resonate with people.
5777	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	We also want it to have a high degree of accuracy."
5778	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	With the White House, the Capitol and oceans of white marble monuments and museums, Washington has rarely wanted for busloads of fifth-graders on field trips or families on a been-there-done- that weekend of sightseeing.
5780	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Though the search for a slogan has captured the most attention, it is part of a larger "branding" initiative to spice up the city's image.
5781	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Victoria Isley, a tourism official here, said the campaign, set to start in the fall, would try in part to sell higher-income visitors on the "D.C. beyond C-Span" -- a growing arts and nightlife scene, newly vibrant neighborhoods and a crop of new hotels, theaters and restaurants.
5782	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"There is an old stereotype that I think still exists -- that Washington is not that fun, it closes after dark, it's a one-note town," said Keith Bellows, editor in chief of National Geographic Traveler and an adviser to the brand task force.
5787	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Across town, in the hard-luck neighborhood of Anacostia, people said jobs, safe streets and affordable housing were more pressing than a new catchphrase.
5788	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"'A Capital City,"' proposed Juan Lyles, 56, a computer operator waiting for a bus.
5789	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"But meaning money, rather than the capital."
5790	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	With neighborhoods gentrifying and high-priced condos popping up across the city, Lyles said, "it's getting out of reach of most of the indigenous population."

5793	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	China's government employees should be banned from offering or receiving cigarettes on social occasions as a first step towards the country's goal to minimize the harm of tobacco on people's health.
5794	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Government departments and their employees are responsible for taking the lead in China's tobacco control," said Yan Aoshuang, a deputy to the 11th National People's Congress (NPC) from Beijing.
5796	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Besides, all government offices should ban smoking in the workplace to ensure a smoking-free environment," she said on the sidelines of the annual parliamentary session.
5798	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Film producers and cinemas should play anti-smoking adverts during intervals, and all TVs should air these adverts for free at prime time," she said.
5800	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	In a regional ban enacted in 1995, the city put hospitals, schools, theaters, libraries, banks, shops and all means of public transport as smoking-free areas.
5802	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	China should also impose higher taxes on tobacco to reduce consumption and encourage insurance companies to offer medical insurance policies covering abstinence treatment, said Shao, a member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in his proposal to the top advisory session.

5806	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	French investigators on Thursday held out little hope of quickly recovering two paintings by Pablo Picasso stolen from the Paris apartment of the artist's granddaughter.
5808	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"It will be a long and difficult investigation," said a source close to the case.
5810	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The thieves made off with a 1961 portrait of Picasso's second wife Jacqueline Roque and "Maya with Doll," a painting of Picasso's daughter done in 1938.
5812	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	A detailed description of the artworks was sent out to all police in France and in neighbouring countries through Interpol, said Bernard Darties, the deputy director of the office overseeing trafficking in cultural goods.
5814	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Darties said that 80 percent of cases involving thefts of major artworks, the perpetrators are "thieves who saw an opportunity", believing that they will cash in on the stolen works "but find themselves unable to sell them."
5815	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Many stolen paintings by Picasso have been recovered over the years after police notified the art market of the theft.
5816	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The risk however is that the perpetrators may decide to destroy the paintings if they find themselves unable to sell them, said Darties.
5817	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	The paintings were on display in the apartment located in the chic Left Bank area of Paris, but security precautions had been taken to protect the works, according to Paul Lombard, a lawyer representing the Picasso family.
5818	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"Maya With Doll" is one of Picasso's classic oil paintings done in bright shades of green, blue and red and depicting young Maya in pigtails holding a doll and a small wooden horse.
5819	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Maya was Widmaier Picasso's mother, born to Marie-Therese Walter, who was one of Picasso's many female companions.

5826	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson's most important contribution in the match so far came when he and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (28 not out) helped lift Australia from a perilous 128 for 5 in the second innings with a 65-run unbeaten partnership.
5827	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	At stumps Australia was 193-5 wickets and had a lead of 263.
5829	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"This test has been the most fun I've ever had playing cricket," he said.
5830	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing learning experience.
5831	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Just batting out there is the most I've ever learnt in an innings."
5833	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing three or four days so far," he said.
5834	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"I'm having more fun than I ever thought I'd have playing cricket.
5835	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I'm just making the most of it and enjoying every second."
5836	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson, 27, was called into the touring squad last month after Andrew Symonds was stood down for disciplinary reasons.
5837	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	It was the end of a long road back from a run of injuries that started when he dislocated a shoulder while fielding in a test against the West Indies in 2005.
5839	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson also chipped in with three wickets as Australia dismissed India for 360 and gained a 70-run first innings lead.
5841	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"Wickets to me don't matter," he said.
5843	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I enjoy every wicket I get -- but they're a massive bonus."
5845	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Paceman Stuart Clark has a sore elbow that is preventing him from throwing overarm but he is expected to bowl on Monday.
5846	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson said he had not talked to Ricky Ponting about his plans for the final day, but had faith in Australia's bowlers to seal a 1-0 advantage in the first of four tests.

5851	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday it had reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with US banking giant Citigroup regarding its marketing of complex debt securities.
5853	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The deal also requires Citigroup to "liquidate" by the end of 2009 some 12 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it sold to other investors.
5856	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The settlement was announced by federal and state regulators as a widespread credit crunch continues to weigh on major Wall Street banks.
5858	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Auction-rate securities, essentially debt instruments issued by financial firms, municipalities and student-loan companies, typically have a fairly lengthy maturity, but the interest rates on such securities can be volatile and change at weekly and monthly auctions overseen by banks.
5859	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The SEC said Citigroup had marketed the securities as "liquid" investments, meaning they were almost as safe and accessible as cash, but the regulators said the securities were illiquid, making it hard for investors to reclaim their holdings.
5863	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Cuomo's office is also probing how other big banks marketed auction-rate securities.

5914	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The bewildering crisis in Lebanon has taken another perplexing twist with reports that the gridlocked parliament has agreed to choose the country's top general, Michel Suleiman, as its next president.
5915	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The question is whether Suleiman represents a genuine compromise among Lebanon's intractable factions or whether his ascension would signal a betrayal of the 2005 "Cedar Revolution," which ended in the promise to kick Syria out of Lebanese politics and give real democracy a chance.
5916	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The presidential selection process has been anything but free or fair.

5925	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Hezbollah's punishing war with Israel, its rapid rearmament and its successful intimidation of parliament have proceeded apace, while the United Nations tribunal charged with investigating the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has dragged.

5932	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	In truth, a leader opposed by Hezbollah cannot control Lebanon today or prevent renewed civil strife, and the West will probably recognize Suleiman.

5973	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A new military plan for troop withdrawals from Iraq that was described in broad terms this week to President-elect Barack Obama falls short of the 16-month timetable Obama outlined during his election campaign, U.S. military officials said Wednesday.
5974	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan was proposed by the top American commanders responsible for Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno, and it represents their first recommendation on troop withdrawals under an Obama presidency.
5975	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	While Obama has said he will seek advice from his commanders, their resistance to a faster drawdown could present the new president with a tough political choice between overruling his generals or backing away from his goal.
5976	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan, completed last week, envisions withdrawing two more brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, from Iraq in the first six months of 2009, the military officials said.
5978	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Transition officials said the plan was described in only general terms to Obama by Robert M. Gates, who is staying on as defense secretary, and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when Obama met for five and a half hours with his national security team on Monday in Chicago.
5979	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	They said all participants had sidestepped the details of how to reconcile Obama's timetable for withdrawing combat forces with the more extended one recommended by the generals.
5980	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A transition official said that in future meetings, "the military will get a chance to articulate their preferences."
5983	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gates has expressed confidence that he and Obama might reach common ground.
5984	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	But in discussing the new plan, senior military officials nonetheless made clear that they were not comfortable with the time frame Obama articulated in the campaign.
5986	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"We are not quite there yet."
5987	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Those at the Chicago meeting included Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama's choice for secretary of state
5989	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gen. James L. Jones, who is to be Obama's national security adviser
5990	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Susan E. Rice, who is to be ambassador to the United Nations
5991	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Rahm Emanuel, who will be White House chief of staff
5992	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gregory B. Craig, who will be White House counsel
5994	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Thomas Donilon, who is expected to be Jones' deputy
5997	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"There was not challenging or questioning of any particular timetable," a transition official said.
5998	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"There wasn't a point on which there was any pushback from either side."
6000	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan drafted by Odierno and Petraeus was drawn up to meet the so-called status of forces agreement between the United States and Iraqi governments that calls for all American forces to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 and all combat troops out of Iraqi cities by June 2009.
6002	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	One way commanders say they will try to meet that first deadline is by effectively reassigning combat troops to training and support of the Iraqis, even though the difference would be in some cases semantic because armed American troops would still go on combat patrols with their Iraqi counterparts.
6004	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A person familiar with the talks said those at the meeting discussed whether the Iraqis would allow "re-missioned" combat forces to remain in Iraqi cities after June.
6005	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Gates and Mullen did not rule out the idea that Iraqis might permit such troops, the person said.
6010	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"It's important that we maintain enough presence here that we can help them through this year of transition," he said.
6012	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	"Three years is a long time," Odierno said.
6013	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The new military plan also calls for American troops in Iraq after 2011, but it does not put a number on that force, a person familiar with its details said.
6014	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	Other topics discussed at the meeting in Chicago included Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Middle East, the detainees at Guantanamo Bay and how the national security policy-making process in the Obama administration would work.

6019	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
6021	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
6023	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
6025	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters also chairs the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that is reviewing the situation and will make recommendations to Congress in a report this year.
6026	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the commission began a two-day hearing with California transit officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's downtown Los Angeles office to discuss the region's needs.
6027	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
6028	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
6029	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
6030	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
6031	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.
6032	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in Atlanta.
6033	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Las Vegas is next, and the commission will conclude its hearings after visiting Minneapolis and Chicago in April.
6035	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Brian Turmail, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said commissioners are asking why all the increased spending on road projects isn't paying off.
6037	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Traffic is getting worse.
6038	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"What we're spending isn't really getting the results we want," he said.
6039	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
6040	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
6041	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund surfaced in 2005.
6042	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
6043	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Later that year, President George W. Bush signed a $286.4 billion transportation law that also established a 12-member commission -- a mix of federal, state and business leaders -- to look for sustainable funding options.
6044	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said hybrids account for just a fraction of the car market and could not be playing a significant role in the decline of the Highway Trust Fund.
6045	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
6047	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
6048	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., said the national highway system has been underfunded for years and that the problems are returning to haunt the government.
6049	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
6050	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
6051	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	At the same time, the price of construction has increased far quicker than inflation, partly driven by a development boom in China that has driven up the price of raw materials such as cement and steel, said Dan Beal, managing director of public policy for the Automobile Club of Southern California.
6052	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
6053	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
6054	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
6055	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	There already is a pilot project on that option in Oregon, but it's not clear how that might affect how much the average driver would pay.
6056	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.
6057	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.
6058	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nobody wants to pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what they're currently paying."

6061	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Three Somali government security forces were killed and a number of other people were wounded Monday in separate attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, while several mortar rounds were slammed into an Ethiopian military base in the city as reinforcement for the Ethiopian troops pour into the Somali capital, witnesses said.
6062	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Two soldiers were killed when assailants threw a hand grenade at an army base in Medina district in the west of Mogadishu and an unknown number of civilians were wounded after the troops fired in response, Yusuf Gedi, a witnesses, told Xinhua.
6063	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	"I saw two dead soldiers being put into an army van after the blast," said Gedi.

6066	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Separately, a government policeman on patrol in Baad market in the north of the Somali capital was killed and his gun taken by suspected Islamist insurgents armed with pistols.
6067	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	"They shot him twice in the head.
6068	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Then they took his gun away after he fell to the ground," Ali Gure, a businessman at the market, told Xinhua.
6069	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Traders at the market said government forces arrived at the site of the attack minutes after the attackers left.
6070	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	The police began questioning bystanders and searching for the assailants.
6071	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Businesses activities at the market were mainly stopped as business people closed their shops.
6072	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Somali government officials, who do not often speak to the media on security matters, were not readily available for comment.
6073	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, a number of mortar rounds hit Ethiopian troops based in a former pasta factory building in Huruwa district in the south of the restive city, witnesses said.
6074	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	The Ethiopian troops, who have been receiving daily attacks from insurgents opposed to their presence in Somalia, are deployed in the country following their crossing of the border last December to help the interim government oust an Islamist movement in control in southern and central Somalia.
6075	XIN_ENG_20071105.0275.LDC2009T13	The troops were getting reinforcement for the past week after days of fierce battles in Mogadishu.

6084	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The studies were presented on Saturday here at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, where the nation's cancer doctors usually discuss the latest in chemotherapy and new biotechnology drugs.
6085	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It is relatively unusual for this meeting to highlight alternative therapies, but doctors here said that might be changing.

6088	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks," said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University, who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.
6089	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
6090	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It tested a shark cartilage extract being developed as a drug by Aeterna Zentaris, a Canadian company.
6092	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Cartilage has been found to contain factors that can impede the formation of blood vessels.
6093	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And cutting off the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with other drugs.
6094	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had died by that point.
6095	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Those who got a placebo had a median survival of 15.6 months.
6096	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
6097	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage extract was given as a liquid that the patients drank twice a day.
6098	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Results were somewhat more promising, though far less definitive, for flaxseed.
6099	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center, involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have their prostates removed.
6100	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	After the glands were removed about a month later, the tumors were studied.
6101	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It was found that the tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did not.
6102	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight fatigue, which is common in people with cancer.
6103	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The study involved 282 patients with various types of cancer.
6106	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Doctors said that it was too early to recommend that patients take flaxseed or ginseng, though they said the supplements were not harmful.
6108	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And the quality and quantity of active ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
6109	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The investigators said the mechanisms of action of the flaxseed and the ginseng were not well understood.

6112	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	In a more conventional study presented here, researchers in Europe found that preventive radiation therapy to the head reduces the risk that tumors will spread to the brain in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
6114	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of all lung cancer cases, but it is an aggressive type.
6115	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Previous studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small area.
6116	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
6117	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Only 14.6 percent of those who got the head radiation had symptoms from a spread of cancer to the brain a year later.
6118	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That compared with 40.4 percent in a control group.
6120	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung cancer specialist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the study, said the findings would "change the standard of care almost immediately."

6143	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, the holiday has gotten more attention, much of it from retailers vying for business from Jewish families.

6172	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	DAKAR, May 3 (Xinhua)
6173	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The time is not ripe for France to disengage itself from the African continent, said Alain Joyandet, France's secretary of state for Cooperation and French- Speaking countries.
6174	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Joyandet stressed that the moment is right for the country "to consolidate its waning presence" in the African continent.
6175	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"This is not the time to leave Africa" because "the time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa is now," Joyandet was quoted as telling reporters shortly after arriving in Dakar on Friday.
6176	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"Competition from Asian countries and the oil-rich emirates is a new element that must be taken into account.
6177	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	There are a number of countries that were not interested in Africa, but who are now beginning to show keen interest," said Joyandet, who is in the Senegalese capital for an official visit.
6178	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"In the decades ahead, the major changes that will take place in economic terms will probably be here in Africa," said the French official.
6179	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"If there is a time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa, it is now.
6180	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	For it is now that we should be laying the foundation for what will happen within the next 20 years," said Joyandet.
6182	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	This goes to underscore the determination of France," said he, adding that "there was no question of going back. "
6183	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The remarks by the senior French official are coming at a time when analysts both inside and outside Africa are wondering whether France will pursue a policy of continuity with Africa or "a new break" as promised by President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of his electoral triumph.
6184	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Asked for comments, Joyandet, who replaced the outspoken Jean- Marie Bockel who openly criticized old-style ties with Africa, replied laconically that his aim is to lead to "the modernization of the existing relations between France and Africa."
6185	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Addressing French nationals residing in Senegal in the presence of the ambassadorr Jean-Christophe Rufin, Joyandet took time to stress the benefits of the existing ties, including economic ones, between France and Senegal.
6187	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The turnover of French subsidiaries and companies accounted for 25 percent of Senegal's gross domestic product (GDP), said he, adding that the companies contributed nearly 28 percent of tax revenues, besides employing 15,000 people.
6188	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	In terms of Official Development Assistance, "Senegal is the country that receives the largest share of France's aid in sub- Saharan Africa," said the French official ahead of a meeting with Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade.

6360	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The banded rat snake -- rarely found in Malaysia and protected under local laws and international wildlife treaties -- is an expensive delicacy in some Asian countries, the New Straits Times and The Star reported.
6361	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	Workers handling cargo at the complex near the Bayan Lepas International Airport in Penang grew suspicious when they heard hissing and "slithering sounds", the Times reported, and alerted wildlife officials.
6362	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The officials found the snakes, worth an estimated 240,000 ringgit (US$68,400

6367	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The European Union said it will resume financing fuel deliveries to the Gaza Strip's sole power plant on Wednesday, after five days of blackouts in the impoverished Palestinian territory.
6368	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"In agreement with the Palestinian Authority, the (European) commission will resume Wednesday, on a provisional basis, deliveries of fuel to the Gaza power plant," said a statement from an EU spokeswoman received by AFP in Jerusalem.
6369	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	No further details were immediately available.
6371	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU blacklists Hamas as a terror group and refuses to have any dealings with the Islamists.
6372	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	If it provides fuel to a power plant, and Hamas earns money from that plant's production, the bloc could be seen to be indirectly financing the movement.
6373	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
6374	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
6375	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would function independently.
6377	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
6378	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
6379	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Western-backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called for the fuel supplies to be resumed, but said his Hamas rivals were to blame for the outages as it was pocketing money from electricity sales.
6380	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
6382	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
6383	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15, with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.
6384	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Egypt, which provides between five and 10 percent of Gaza's electricity, said the supplies should not be used for political ends.
6385	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"Agreements to supply electricity to Gaza's inhabitants should remain as they are and no party, whoever they might be, should use basic utilities as poitical cards," foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said in a statement.

6429	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The lines formed at dawn and remained long throughout the day -- hundreds upon hundreds of Venezuelans queuing up to buy scarce milk, chicken and sugar at state-run outdoor markets staffed by soldiers in fatigues.
6430	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	President Hugo Chavez's government is trying to cope with scattered shortages of some foods, and long lines at state-run "Megamercal" street markets over the weekend show many Venezuelans are willing to wait for hours to snap up a handful of products they seldom find in supermarkets.
6431	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"You have to get in line and you have to be lucky," said Maria Fernandez, a 64-year-old housewife who was buying milk and chicken on Sunday.
6432	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She said trying to find milk is a constant frustration.
6433	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with the last can.
6434	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The long lines for basic foods at subsidized prices are paradoxical for an oil-rich nation that in many ways is a land of plenty.
6435	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Shopping malls are bustling, new car sales are booming and privately owned supermarkets are stocked with American potato chips, French wines and Swiss Gruyere cheese.
6436	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Yet other foods covered by price controls -- eggs, fresh chicken -- periodically are hard to find in supermarkets.
6437	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Fresh milk has become a luxury, and even baby formula is scarcer nowadays.
6438	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for re-election indefinitely.
6439	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Some government officials accuse producers of holding basic goods off the market to profiteer or to sow discontent among Venezuela's poor, Chavez's core supporters.
6440	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
6443	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	And importers also face hurdles.
6445	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Those without approval regularly turn to the black market, buying dollars for about three times the fixed rate.
6448	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	But they also complained of struggling to find milk, chicken, sugar and cooking oil elsewhere at prices set by the government.
6449	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"I arrived at 6 in the morning to get in line," said Doris Bastida, 32, a mother of four who wheeled an infant son in a stroller.
6450	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had been waiting for about four hours by the time she reached the entrance.

6452	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	I don't have anywhere else to go," she said.

6454	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Bastida said she still believes in Chavez and plans to vote in favor of his reforms "so that things will get better."
6455	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Plus, she said, if "everyone votes 'no,' they're going to take the Megamercal away from us."
6456	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run again in 2012.

6459	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Chavez says he is aiming to boost agriculture with projects including state-supported sugar harvesting and a milk processing plant started with help from Iran.
6461	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Chavez's food minister, Gen. Rafael Oropeza, said the open-air markets were fully stocked across the country over the weekend.
6462	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He said leg of pork -- a popular holiday dish -- was imported because local suppliers declined to participate.
6463	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"I'm putting out a call to businesses for them to raise production and respond to the demand," Oropeza said, according to the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional.
6464	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He suggested there were political motives behind the shortages.
6465	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"That's the objective, that the people reach the point of desperation," Oropeza said.
6466	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The Venezuelan Food Industry Chamber denied its members are to blame, saying they are working to satisfy rapidly growing consumer demand.
6467	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Oropeza said the government sold a record 5,948 metric tons (6,557 tons) at its weekend markets nationwide.

6475	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she created that uses computer play to teach reading.
6476	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for children.
6477	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" launched by Sabi Inc. immerses children in an animated world that they control and shape by using software developed by Microsoft Labs.
6478	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	On-screen boys and girls coax players into helping with missions that involve drawing houses, trees or other objects brought to animated life and into understanding increasingly sophisticated sentences along the way.
6479	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for kids gaming," Johnson said.
6480	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"We wanted to have a fun game fine-tuned to the way children learn," she said.
6481	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity stakes in firms.
6482	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Game-based education is a very exciting concept, and one that we have been interested in for many years," said Microsoft chief research and strategy officer Craig Mundie.
6483	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Sabi consulted learning specialists and brought in engineers that worked on videogames for Microsoft's XBox 360 consoles and computers running the Windows operating system.
6487	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	It is our goal and passion to establish this category of games that children actually think are fun and, you know what, you happen to start reading."
6489	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
6490	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market," said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures Program.

6495	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's great to see them learning and being creative, and having so much fun at the same time," Todd said.

6498	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for cleaner air.
6500	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	New passenger cars currently emit about 160 grammes of CO2 per kilometre.
6501	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Under the proposal, auto makers would be required to limit average emissions across their fleet to 130 grammes per kilometer by improving the technology they use.
6504	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Dimas sought a tough binding limit of 120 grammes for car makers while Verheugen wanted measures to be shared with tyre, equipment and fuel makers, easing the burden on the automobile industry, which he says employs 12 million people directly or indirectly in Europe.
6508	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European car industry association said in a statement.
6509	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"It will lead to a loss of jobs and a relocation of production outside Europe," it added.
6510	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	European, Japanese and Korean manufacturers have failed to meet a voluntary target to cut average emissions for new cars sold in Europe by 25 percent from 1995 levels.
6511	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission says they have so far only decreased emissions by 12.4 percent, which the EU executive describes as "not satisfactory."
6512	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Road transport pollution has risen 30 percent since 1990 and now makes up more than a quarter of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions, with half of that from passenger cars.
6513	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission's hesitation to bring forward plans on car emissions cast a shadow over a recent drive to fight climate change, which was one of the main planks of a wide-ranging energy action plan it unveiled last month.

6534	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	"There are things to negotiate," Umberto Bossi told lawmakers, according to the ANSA news agency.
6537	AFP_ENG_20080430.0252.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, another Northern League stalwart, former reforms minister Roberto Calderoli, said "allowing free circulation to new members like Romania was a mistake."

6549	XIN_ENG_20081104.0058.LDC2009T13	An official at the U.S. embassy confirmed that it has received the threat.

6565	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is the large tote trend going to die down this spring?
6566	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
6567	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
6568	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Do you want to carry magazines, files, bottled water and gym clothes with you every day?
6569	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Then a big tote is essential.
6571	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	The gargantuan bag (a la Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you need a big bag I say go for it.
6572	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	One thing to note in the back pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their design.

6577	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Tips?

6582	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'd also suggest scouring the men's furnishings dept at department stores -- they often stock more of these styles than ladies' bag departments.

6586	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	It's just not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.
6587	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I'm wearing a Nicole Miller leopard print dress to a cocktail party.
6589	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Also, should my accessories be understated and neutral, like golds and browns?
6592	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
6594	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A cropped jacket of some sort would be more chic than a pashmina, which is a perfectly acceptable but not terribly fashion-forward choice.
6595	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.

6597	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, matte bronze or even dark burgundy would look great here.

6600	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
6601	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	And if this weather keeps up, they'll be practical, too!
6602	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I recently purchased a long, black, boyfriend-style cardigan ... (that) ends about two inches above my knee with buttons going down the front and has three-quarter-length sleeves.
6603	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
6605	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look lumpy under the cardigan.
6609	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church said Wednesday that it is being pushed toward painful decisions on questions of sexuality and scriptural interpretation by ``impatient forces'' eager for clarity, but urged members to wait and be without fear as the church struggles through a difficult time.
6610	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Appearing in a live webcast, the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori acknowledged that the church, the American wing of the global Anglican Communion, risks losing its place and voice in that fellowship if it does not comply with demands from Anglican leaders that it bar official blessings for same-sex couples and take other actions.
6611	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the divisive issues.
6612	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to find a way to live together,'' she said.
6613	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In a meeting that ended last week in Tanzania, the leaders, or primates, of Anglican provinces around the world issued an ultimatum to the U.S church.
6615	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a long-simmering conflict between liberal and conservative church members in the United States and abroad reached crisis when the Episcopal Church consecrated its first gay bishop, V. Gene Robinson of New Hampshire.
6616	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, Robinson made his first public comments on the Tanzania meeting, saying the Episcopal Church should not yield to demands that it roll back its acceptance of gays.
6617	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead, he said, it should ``get on with the work of the Gospel.''
6618	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	In response, Jefferts Schori said Wednesday that such a decision was not hers to make, and that she did not know exactly where the Episcopal Church's leadership and membership stood.
6619	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	She said a clearer understanding might emerge after two upcoming meetings: a gathering this weekend of its executive council, which includes bishops, clergy and laity, and of its House of Bishops in mid- March.
6620	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	(Optional add end)
6622	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.
6623	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	One caller said her daughter, a lesbian seeking to become an Episcopal priest, was broken-hearted by the primates' demands.
6624	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori advised.
6625	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``It seems very harsh,'' the caller said.
6626	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her concerns.
6627	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	But she repeated her call for forbearance.
6629	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``That hunger for clarity at all costs is an anxious response to discomfort in the face of change.''

6635	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	At least 2,400 chickens have died since Wednesday at a farm in the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki prefecture (state), and prefectural officials were conducting bird flu tests.
6637	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The National Institute of Animal Health near Tokyo has identified the virus as the type-A influenza of the H5 family and is running DNA tests to determine further details, Tanaka said.
6639	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The confirmation of the virulent H5 virus means all remaining 10,000 breeding and egg-laying chickens raised at the farm must be culled, beginning as early as Sunday, Tanaka said.
6640	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, the virulent H5N1 of bird flu has claimed at least 157 lives worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
6642	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japan's most recent H5N1 outbreak occurred in Kyoto in 2004.
6645	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The Agriculture Ministry also ordered a nationwide inspection of poultry farms to detect any signs of sick birds, and environment officials began a national survey to look into the possibility that a bird flu virus might have been brought by migratory birds from other parts of Asia.
6646	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Miyazaki, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is the nation's largest poultry producing region.
6650	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Their release comes just days after Tuareg rebels in Mali, Niger's neighbor, released 22 hostages last week -- the last of about 40 soldiers and government officials taken prisoner in August raids.
6654	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He, too, thanked a foundation set up by Gadhafi for the men's release.
6657	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Gadhafi, Libya's leader, has long been rumored to be providing logistical support to the rebels.
6658	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Albade said that Niger "wanted to reiterate the gratitude it feels toward the Gadhafi foundation for its good work."
6659	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	But the minister rejected the possibility of a directly negotiating with the Niger Movement for Justice, known by its French acronym of MNJ, who grabbed the 25 hostages during a raid last June.
6660	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He said the government would only negotiate with these rebels once they put down their arms.
6661	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Six hostages remain in MNJ custody.

6663	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	BONN, Germany 2007-03-13 00:25:20 UTC
6664	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Under pressure from global trade rivals, EU nations were expected to push former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions on Tuesday to complete negotiations on new regional free trade pacts by the end of 2007, deals which aid groups fear could lead to more harm than good.
6666	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Regional "economic partnership" trade pacts with the 27-nation EU are supposed to be concluded this year, but the talks have been stalled for months due to market access, good governance and aid levels.
6667	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Many of the 78-poor nation grouping known as the ACP group of former European colonies are also loathe to give up over three decades of dependency on privileged access to EU markets.
6668	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"The timeframe for the conclusion ... by the end of 2007 is tight, but we should make use of it," said Germany's Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who is hosting the talks here at an exclusive resort overlooking the Rhine River valley.
6670	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ministers and officials were to debate how to provide energy to the poorest nations in Africa, while making sure the electricity they use come from renewable sources.
6671	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz appealed to the EU ministers at informal dinner talks Monday night that the trade pacts go hand in hand with substantial aid to build up key infrastructure like roads and electrical grids, which are critical for an economy to function.
6672	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"What they need right now is more financial assistance, there are many other things as well but you can't build a private sector without electricity and roads," Wolfowitz said.
6673	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The trade accords foresee gradual market openings in parallel with EU funding for good governance and reforms in developing nations so as to spur trade among them.
6674	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Aid groups however, have derided the negotiations saying the deals threaten to undermine poverty reduction.
6675	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Klaus Schilder from aid group World Economy, Ecology and Development, WEED, said the trade pacts on the table "go beyond what is being negotiated" at world trade talks, and include such areas like investment, services and other business sectors which developing countries do not want to include in the talks.
6677	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The EU is conducting negotiations with the Caribbean
6678	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	West Africa
6680	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The European Commission said all the talks concluded so far that they need to create "the widest possible market access" to the EU's vast market for ACP regions.
6681	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ACP nations are mostly ex-European colonies.
6682	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The EU has promised them a doubling of aid to euro2 billion (US$2.6 billion) by 2010.
6683	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Half is to come from the EU budget, the other half from the 25 EU governments.
6684	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Climate change means hunger and thirst for billions: report
6685	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Billions of people will suffer water shortages and the number of hungry will grow by hundreds of millions by 2080 as global temperatures rise, scientists warn in a report leaked Tuesday.
6686	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report estimates that between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion people will be suffering from water scarcity problems by 2080 and between 200 million and 600 million more people will be going hungry.
6687	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The assessment is contained in a draft of a major international report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to be released later this year, Australia's The Age newspaper said.
6688	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Rising sea levels could flood seven million more homes, while Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef, treasured as the world's largest living organism, could be dead within decades, the scientists warn, the newspaper said.
6689	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The Age said it had obtained a copy of the report, believed to be one of three prepared for release by the IPCC, which is highly regarded for its neutrality and caution.
6690	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Some 500 experts are meeting in Paris this week ahead of the release on Friday of the IPCC's first report since 2001 on the state of scientific knowledge on global warming.
6693	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Bleaching occurs when the plant-like organisms that make up coral die and leave behind the white limestone skeleton of the reef.
6695	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Average global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 to 0.8 degrees since 1900, which the report says contributed to increased bleaching in coral reefs in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.
6696	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	At 2.0 to 3.0 degrees above 1900 levels, the report predicts the "complete loss" of Australia's alpine zones and the possible collapse of South America's Amazon forest system, causing a "huge loss of biodiversity".
6697	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The human and economic costs of climate change are likely to be highest in poor countries, with water shortages crippling many African nations and increased coastal flooding hitting low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and many Pacific islands, the report says.
6700	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Hurricane Felix slammed into Nicaragua's Miskito Coast as a record-breaking Category 5 monster storm Tuesday in an area home to thousands of stranded Miskito Indians.
6701	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, off Mexico's Pacific coast, Tropical Storm Henriette strengthened into a hurricane with 120 kph (75 mph) winds and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was plowing toward the upscale resort of Cabo San Lucas, popular with Hollywood stars and sea fishing enthusiasts.
6702	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Felix landed around dawn at Punta Gorda with winds of about 260 kph (160 mph), only two weeks after Hurricane Dean struck Mexico, further up the Caribbean coast.
6703	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	It was first time that two Category 5 hurricanes have hit land in a season since 1886, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
6704	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Only 31 such storms have been recorded in the Atlantic, including eight in the last five seasons.
6705	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Nicaragua's Civil Defense chief, Rogelio Flores, said 2,000 people were evacuated before the hurricane blew roofs off homes, blocked roads and knocked out telephone service.
6706	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	But many other Miskito Indians refused to leave low-lying areas and head to shelters set up in schools.
6707	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Twenty fishermen were missing, the newspaper La Prensa reported.
6709	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The Nicaraguan government sent in some soldiers before the storm hit, but was preparing to send in more help once the hurricane passed.
6710	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Flores, who said he was getting radio reports from officials sent in before the storm, said there were no immediate reports of casualties.
6711	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	In the seaside resort of La Ceiba, residents spent the night reinforcing flimsy house walls with plywood and sandbags.
6712	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be strong, but we have faith that Christ will protect us," said 37-year-old housewife Sandra Hernandez, watching satellite images of the storm on television.
6713	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Off Mexico's Pacific coast, meanwhile, Henriette strengthened into a hurricane and was on a path to hit the tip of the Baja California Peninsula on Tuesday afternoon.
6714	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The had sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph).
6715	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) it was centered about 120 kilometers (80 miles) south-southeast of the peninsula.
6716	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Before dawn Tuesday, strong waves pounded the resort's beaches, rain fell in sheets and strong winds whipped palm trees.
6718	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	On Monday, police in Cabo San Lucas said high surf stirred up by Henriette led to the drowning of an unidentified woman.
6719	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, the storm caused flooding and landslides that killed six people in Acapulco.
6720	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, in the final hours before Hurricane Felix was expected to hit, Grupo Taca Airlines frantically airlifted tourists from the Honduran island of Roatan, popular for its pristine reefs and diving resorts, while the U.S. Southern Command said in a statement that a Chinook helicopter evacuated 19 U.S. citizens, including tourists and members of U.S. Joint Task Force-Bravo who were visiting the island.
6722	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Bob Shearer, 54, from Butler, Pennsylvania, said he was disappointed his family's scuba diving trip to Roatan was cut short by the evacuation order.

6724	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	I hope they didn't jump the gun too soon," he said as he waited for a flight home in the San Pedro Sula airport.
6725	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Felix was projected to rake central Honduras, slam into Guatemala and then cut across southern Mexico, well south of Texas.
6726	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	Its massive storm surge could devastate Indian communities along the Miskito Coast, an isolated region straddling the Honduras- Nicaragua border where Miskito Indians live in wooden shacks, get around on canoes and subsist on fish, beans, rice, cassava and plantains.
6728	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The only path to safety is up rivers and across lakes that are too shallow for regular boats, but many lack gasoline for long journeys.
6731	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Felix could dump up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain in isolated parts of northern Honduras and northeastern Nicaragua, possibly bringing flash floods and mudslides.
6732	APW_ENG_20070904.0656.LDC2009T13	In the highland capital of Tegucigalpa, more than 160 kilometers (100 miles) inland, authorities cleared vendors from markets prone to flooding.

6747	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
6748	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous that I've decided to confront it head on by talking to the press," she said.
6749	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I am frustrated and angry.
6750	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I believe that I am absolutely 100 percent innocent."
6752	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	At the end, she took no questions and left the news conference.
6753	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The 27-year-old Swiss player lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Laura Granville, 6-4, 6-2.
6754	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said the positive test, which could lead to a doping suspension of up to two years, led to her retirement because she doesn't want to spend years fighting the case.
6755	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
6756	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis returned to the sport two years ago after a four-year absence because of injuries.
6758	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She came within one match of winning the Grand Slam in 1997, losing only in the French Open final.
6760	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She was 16 years, 6 months and 1 day at the time.
6762	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, who lost in the third round of the U.S. Open, hasn't played since her second-round loss to Peng Shuai of China, 7-5, 6-1, in Beijing on Sept. 19.
6763	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Former top-ranked player Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek had positive tests for cocaine at the 1995 French Open.
6768	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.
6769	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.
6770	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I only know that if I were to try to hit the ball while in any state of euphoria, it simply wouldn't work.
6771	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I would think that it would be impossible for anyone to maintain the coordination required to play top class tennis while under the influence of drugs.
6773	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she later underwent a privately arranged hair test which came back negative for cocaine.
6774	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	The official backup "B" sample test on her Wimbledon urine sample, however, tested positive for the drug.
6775	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample taken during Wimbledon.
6776	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.
6777	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said it could take years to fight her case.
6778	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I have no desire to spend the next several years of my life reduced to fighting against the doping officials," she said.
6779	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"The fact is that it is more and more difficult for me, physically, to keep playing at the top of the game.
6780	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"And frankly, accusations such as these don't exactly provide me with motivation to even make another attempt to do so."
6781	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Widmer said the test was on June 29 but that Hingis heard about the positive result in mid-September and the positive 'B' sample two or three weeks later.
6782	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She has great angst over this," Widmer said.
6783	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She is heartbroken.
6784	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	... It's crazy.
6785	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	It's very complicated and complex."
6786	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	WTA Tour chief executive Larry Scott said the tour had not received any official information about a positive test and "as a result we are not in a position to comment on the matter."
6787	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"However, it is important to remember that in the area of anti- doping, all players are presumed innocent until proven otherwise," Scott said.
6788	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Referring to her retirement, he said, "Martina Hingis is a tremendous champion and a fan favorite the world over.
6789	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	In her most recent comeback, she proved again that she can perform at the very highest levels of the game."
6791	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"With Martina a great player is retiring, who was always an example and a figurehead for tennis in Switzerland," association president Rene Stammbach said in the statement.

6811	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They made Caracas into Calcutta," the Venezuelan writer Fausto Maso lamented in the epilogue of a recently reissued memoir of bohemian exploits in the 1970s and 1980s along Sabana Grande, the tree-lined boulevard that once symbolized this city's effervescent intellectual life.
6812	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
6813	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
6814	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But at the beginning of this year, buoyed by President Hugo Chavez's re-election victory, the local government allied with him responded to the many complaints about the area and cleared the vendors out.
6815	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedestrians have flowed back, giving hope of renewal to many people in the area.
6816	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"This place has gone from being an area in which you risked your life to something approaching pleasurable," said Ramon Martinez, a waiter at a restaurant on the boulevard for the last four years.
6817	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
6818	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Citing morgue records, newspapers here reported 265 killings last month, which would make it one of the deadliest in the city's recorded history.
6819	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The police disputed the figure, saying that there were 169 killings.
6820	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	In Sabana Grande, pickpockets flourished under the vendors' plastic tarps, where products like pharmaceuticals of dubious origin, smuggled Colombian lingerie or pirated Hollywood DVDs were available.
6823	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Before the efforts began to restrict them, the city had about 150,000 of these vendors, according to Cedice, a research organization.
6826	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"At least they should use Cuba as an example in this respect."
6831	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Clearing out the vendors has also started a debate about the boulevard's future, with fervent supporters of the president trying to transform it into an area for discussing the direction of Venezuelan politics.
6833	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
6834	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Whatever their political stripe, urban planners are enthusiastic about reinvigorating what is considered the city's premier public space.
6835	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
6838	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching transformation, though, after migration surged from other regions.
6839	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
6840	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
6842	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
6843	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Critics of the municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic because it took place only after the president won re-election in December.
6846	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
6847	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	An earlier effort would have been difficult.
6848	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
6849	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
6850	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors say promises of government loans have gone unmet.
6851	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
6852	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."
6856	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Officials even organized a small Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.
6857	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls," Aponte reminisced.
6858	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They would smile," he said.

6934	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Ibrahimovic, who came on at the start of the second half, scored in the 88th, curling in a shot from 20 meters (yards) out that bounced off the post into the net.
6935	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Inter coach Jose Mourinho rested striker Ibrahimovic in the first half but with Adriano, Amantino Mancini and Ricardo Quaremsa up front, his side seemed to have enough firepower to sink Bremen.
6936	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Still, Inter had only one clear chance, but Adriano's effort was spoiled by goalkeeper Tim Wiese.

6938	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	Ibrahimovic came on for Adriano at the break, but Bremen had the first chance, with Pizarro sending a volley high over the net.

6940	APW_ENG_20081209.1278.LDC2009T13	With the game picking up pace, Cesar did well to parry Pizarro's strong shot from the edge of the penalty area.

7010	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	But many Ukrainians worry that the Russian government is stealthily working to stir up separatist sentiment.
7012	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russian officials say it's not true.
7013	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov, who has been banned from Ukraine for his rhetoric on Crimea, has said the region "doesn't belong" to Ukraine.
7014	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Moscow and Sevastopol have long had close ties, and the Moscow city government has built schools and apartment housing in the Ukrainian city.

7017	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Many locals gripe about the mandatory teaching of the Ukrainian language in schools and its use in the media and government paperwork.
7018	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Pro-Russia leaders also accuse the Ukrainian government of slowly moving people into the region from other parts of the country, and of installing pro-Kiev leaders in the city government.
7019	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	"Faster, faster, faster to make everybody a Ukrainian," complained Raisa Telyatnikova, head of the Russian Community of Sevastopol.

7023	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	Russian flags flutter throughout the city, a statue of Catherine the Great looms on the main street, and Russian is heard on most every corner.

7028	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The fleet's presence here is woven into history, Russian military officials say.

7042	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, topping the agenda of a meeting of alliance defence ministers Thursday, now comprises almost 35,500 troops.
7043	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to official figures released Wednesday.
7044	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had rotated among different nations every six months.
7045	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO expanded its operations from Kabul and the relatively quiet north and west of the conflict-torn country, to the south and east, where a resurgent Taliban militia has opposed it.
7046	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The Taliban, ousted from power in late 2001 for harbouring Osama bin Laden, is expected to mount a new offensive in the south and east in coming weeks as the weather warms.
7047	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Its fighters seized control of one town last week.
7049	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	On the eve of the NATO meeting in Seville, Germany announced plans to deploy six reconnaissance jets -- and the 500 personnel needed to run them -- but it insists they will play no combat role.
7050	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Britain also announced that it would have an additional 800 troops in the south of the country by the Afghan summer.
7051	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Poland has started deploying around 1,000 troops, which are likely to be in place by April.
7052	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO's new military chief, US General Bantz Craddock, is likely to urge the 26 alliance nations to come up with an additional three battalions, whose size differs from country to country but should mean about 3,000 personnel.
7053	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Officials say, though, that no new offers are likely to be made in Seville.
7054	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The ISAF operation -- NATO's most ambitious mission ever -- is aimed at spreading the influence of President Hamid Karzai's weak central government to the more lawless outlying regions.
7055	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The way it plays out could determine the future of the 60-year- old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations, or more modestly just peacekeeping and reconstruction.

7060	XIN_ENG_20080806.0256.LDC2009T13	The batch of delegation has five members, including Tourism Minister and National Olympic Committee of Cambodia (NOCC) president Thong Khon, NOCC secretary general Mea Sarun, another swimmer and two youths attending the Olympic Summer Camp.
7061	XIN_ENG_20080806.0256.LDC2009T13	"I am very glad to go to Beijing for the Olympics," Thong Khon told Xinhua at the Phnom Penh International Airport.

7065	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warns about attack amid mixed signals on nuclear crisis
7066	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
7067	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"Iran, if there were any kind of activity of any sort, is not going to be quiet and would react fiercely," Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari said here when asked what Tehran would do in the event of an attack.
7068	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	He added that oil prices, which have been driven to record levels partly because of fear about the loss of Iran's 4.0-million- barrel-a-day output, would rise sharply if Israel or the United States launched a military strike.
7069	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	His comments on the sidelines of an oil conference here came as Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking to US media, said that a "new process" was underway in the dispute about the country's nuclear programme.
7070	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The encouragement was greeted with scepticism by Washington but more positively in Brussels where EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana described as "interesting."
7071	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
7072	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
7073	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"A process is underway and it started with the package delivered by Iran," Mottaki said in an interview with US media in New York, according to the state- run IRNA news agency.
7074	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
7075	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	There has been a surge in speculation recently that Israel might be planning a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites after it emerged that Israel had carried out practice runs.
7076	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
7077	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday it would be in Iran's interest to accept the package and warned against provocative remarks that could destabilise the situation.
7078	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The White House said Wednesday that it was sceptical about Mottaki's comments and President George W. Bush again stressed that military action was possible despite his preference for diplomacy.
7079	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"I have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the United States is to solve this problem diplomatically," Bush told reporters in the White House Rose Garden.
7081	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	No Iranian official has suggested in the past months that Tehran is ready to give any ground on the key question of enrichment, which Iran must suspend in order to enter the talks offered by the world powers.
7082	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had repeatedly vowed that Iran will never suspend enrichment and Khamenei himself has said many times over the past years that Tehran will not back down in the standoff.
7083	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful and it needs nuclear energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out.
7084	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The United States and its regional ally Israel have never ruled out military strikes to end what they see as Tehran's defiance.
7085	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	After warning of Iran's response to any aggression, Oil Minister Nozari stressed that the country, the fourth-biggest oil producer in the world, was a "reliable source of supply to the market and Iran remains a supplier forever."
7086	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Analysts fear that Iran would cease crude exports and could block key Gulf oil shipping routes if attacked.
7090	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The comments, made at the World Petroleum Congress industry event, followed signs of growing tension between crude producing and consuming countries over who is to blame for record crude prices.

7096	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The vacation was the family's first.
7097	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	They hadn't been able to afford to take along teachers who would help with the kids.

7099	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	It has to be one on one," Rospars Keffer said.
7100	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	About a year ago, Michael Keffer's sister, Wendy Heaton, sent an e-mail asking DeGeneres to consider the Keffer family if she were to dedicate a show to a deserving family.
7101	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"I would love to see something really good happen for this family," wrote Heaton, 38, of Glen Allen, Va.
7102	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	In January, the comedienne surprised Heaton and Rospars Keffer with a phone call during a taping of the show, telling them she would provide a trip for both families.
7103	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It's amazing what you're doing, and Julie, it's wonderful that you stay so positive," DeGeneres said.
7104	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The show also paid for two teachers to go along: school psychologist Christie Schrank, who has worked with all three kids, and behavior analyst Kim Halter, who works with Abbie.
7105	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Meals were paid for by Disney, which also let the Keffer family spend one night at the Cinderella Castle Suite, replete with a butler.
7107	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It really was incredible," Rospars Keffer said.
7109	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Megan, who can answer questions when she can choose among answers, said she liked Magic Kingdom more than EPCOT and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad more than Space Mountain.
7111	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Although Abbie, who does not have functional language skills, had difficulty getting through the dark and confined waiting line areas, Rospars Keffer said she loved the roller coasters.
7113	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	When a kid became irritable, either Halter or Schrank led them away so the family could enjoy the moment.
7114	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"The teachers were the element that changed the vacation from good to great," Michael Keffer said.
7115	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	His wife agreed, saying "We said it will be hard to go back after this."

7129	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Inc. on Monday, accusing the drugmaker of defrauding the main health benefit program for the poor and other government insurance programs by hiding the risks of heart problems associated with its pain medication Vioxx.
7130	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, said the state's Medicaid and Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage programs have paid more than $100 million (euro72 million) for Vioxx prescriptions since the drug went on sale in 1999.
7131	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	For its residents receiving Medicaid assistance, New York City paid a substantial share of those costs.
7133	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Those funds would not have been spent had the risks associated with Vioxx been known, court papers say.
7135	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, removed Vioxx from the market in Sept. 30, 2004 because it doubled risk of heart attack and stroke.
7137	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	This "disinformation campaign" continued until a month before Merck ceased sales of the drug, causing New York doctors to continue writing prescriptions for Vioxx that they otherwise would not have written, according to the lawsuit.
7138	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck spokesman Kent Jarrell said the company researched and monitored the drug while it was on the market and voluntarily withdrew it when problems were suspected.
7139	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that our behavior has been responsible," Jarrell said, adding that similar lawsuits seeking reimbursement for insurance costs have been filed in "a handful" of other states.

7185	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Australia announced Thursday that it had agreed to host a new US military communications base, calling it a practical expression of the strong alliance between the two countries.
7186	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	The base would serve as a ground station for communications with American military forces throughout the world, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told parliament.
7188	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	"These facilities are fundamental in underpinning and giving practical effect to the US alliance, and the government is strongly committed to the alliance as the key guarantee to our nation's security," Downer said.
7189	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Details of the agreement on the new base, at Kojarena near Geraldton in Western Australia, were expected to be finalised within months, Defence Minister Brendan Nelson said.
7190	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	The announcement comes at a time when Australia's alliance with the United States and its involvement in the Iraq war are subjects of heated debate.
7191	AFP_ENG_20070215.0008.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister John Howard has been accused by the opposition Labor Party of jeopardising relations by interfering in US domestic politics as the race to succeed President George W. Bush, a Republican, gets under way.

7196	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the international space station.
7197	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Officials with the European Space Agency said all other systems on the state-of-the-art spacecraft were working well following its launch from the agency's base in South America, and they did not expect the engine problem to keep the transport, named the Jules Verne, from docking with the space station next month.
7198	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning.
7199	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The shuttle is carrying up part of a Japanese-made laboratory that will ultimately join labs produced by the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency that are already attached to the orbiting station.
7200	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Japanese astronaut Takao Doi is one of seven astronauts on the shuttle flight, which is transporting parts of the Kibo laboratory as well as a Canadian-built two-armed robotic system called Dextre.
7201	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The planned 16-day shuttle mission, the longest so far to the space station, is part of a concerted effort by NASA to finish assembly of the long-delayed space station by September 2010, at which point the three space shuttles will be retired.
7202	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year gap.
7203	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	NASA will have to rely on the Russian space agency to do most of the ferrying of astronauts and cargo to and from the station.
7204	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Europeans' Jules Verne, which is carrying 4.6 tons of cargo, is the first of six transport launches the Europeans promised as their contribution to the space station effort.
7205	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The vehicle has taken almost a decade to develop and launch.
7209	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	That docking cannot take place, however, until the shuttle Endeavour has arrived and departed -- more than two weeks from Tuesday.
7211	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	About half of the Jules Verne's payload is propellant for use by rockets that periodically push the space station higher to compensate for the natural decay of its orbit.
7212	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The rest is oxygen, drinking water and dry goods.
7213	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	After spending four months docked to the station, the transport will carry away waste and will burn up in the atmosphere as the transport plunges to Earth over the southern Pacific Ocean.
7214	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Japanese space agency is also developing a space station transport, as are two private American companies working with NASA.

7222	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	It was then that Zapatero unexpectedly swept to victory, ousting Rajoy's Popular Party from power as enraged voters protested the government's mishandling of terrorist bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid three days before the election.
7223	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The candidates have used this year's campaign not only to lay out starkly different visions for Spain but also to settle personal scores.
7224	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Rajoy still contends that he was a victim of circumstances in 2004, robbed of victory after his party insisted that the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA was responsible for the attack, despite evidence that pointed to radical Islamists.
7226	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Zapatero sees himself as armed with "a secular vision" aimed at eradicating sexual inequality and religious conservatism, granting more autonomy to Spain's provinces and integrating immigrants.
7227	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, Rajoy is a prisoner of the past who has sought revenge for his electoral loss in 2004 by using the conservative party he heads to try to undermine the government's ability to rule.
7228	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Despite the mudslinging, political analysts and pollsters say neither candidate has managed to excite voters or lay out a coherent vision.
7232	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Throughout the campaign, Rajoy has attacked Zapatero for negotiating with ETA.
7233	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Zapatero cut off the talks after ETA bombed Madrid's airport in December 2006, then admitted in January of this year that indirect contacts had continued.

7268	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique organic farming technique, Huang said she is trying to get produce generated under the program certified as organic produce.
7271	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations.
7272	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	They have to grow the strain selected by the rice production plant and cannot use any pesticides or chemical fertilizers, Huang said.
7273	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production volume to quality is the most difficult part of promoting the farming technique, even though farmers know that it is a good technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.
7274	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded in 1926.
7275	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks beside their rice farms.
7276	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Three farmers who cultivate a 1.68-hectare plot of land together have had to raise about 500 ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang said.
7277	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in carrying out the mission, but found that ducks are the most effective, " Huang said.
7279	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many bugs around, they are still beneficial to farmland.
7280	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She added that having ducks in rice fields is also a good way to attract tourists to the area.
7287	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
7288	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
7290	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
7291	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
7292	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We expected more.
7293	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	For whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to where we thought we were going to get."
7294	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	As Girardi sifts through the damage of a year in which the Yankees have spent only two days in first place in the American League East, and none since April, he is more comfortable blaming himself than he is in openly dissecting how and why the team fizzled.
7295	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
7296	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.

7300	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Jeter, the team's captain, said that Girardi made a smooth transition as Joe Torre's successor and did "a good job."
7301	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
7302	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
7303	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
7304	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from finishing in fourth place.
7305	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Hank Steinbrenner, the Yankees' co-chairman, has complimented Girardi, the uninspiring season has created questions about his performance.
7307	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
7308	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?
7310	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
7311	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
7312	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You don't really know what it's like to be the manager of the New York Yankees until you go through it," he said.
7313	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'
7314	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
7315	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
7316	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
7317	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
7319	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
7320	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
7321	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.
7322	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I worry about the people who know me understanding why I did something."
7323	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for the YES Network.
7324	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism.
7325	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Torre overused some pitchers and did not trust others.
7326	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
7327	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins in 2006, needed to improve in other areas.
7328	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
7329	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
7331	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	It's another thing to also be honest about how you really feel and what's going on.
7332	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
7333	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
7334	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
7335	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said he was surprised at how dejected Girardi appeared after the Yankees' first defeat of the season.
7338	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Everybody suffers.
7339	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We don't want to lose.
7340	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't think our players want to lose, either.
7341	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough road.
7343	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Few have had as tough a year as Cano, whose average has plummeted to .260 this season from .306 last year.
7344	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	His on-base percentage is a sickly .294.
7345	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Larry Bowa, a former third-base coach for the Yankees, said he motivated Cano by getting "in his face."
7346	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
7348	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Andy Pettitte said Girardi held several team meetings in which he showed a fiery side, estimating that Girardi had challenged the Yankees as much as Torre ever did.
7349	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
7350	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
7352	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not specific.
7353	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
7356	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There are always "successful things" that happen across 162 games, he said, but how a team finishes is all that is relevant.
7357	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Did you get to where you thought that you should get?"
7360	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The final answer will undoubtedly be no.

7365	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite a former Bank of China official who allegedly siphoned 1 billion yuan (128 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to Canada, the Beijing Daily reported Friday.
7366	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The report said Gao Shan, former head of a branch of the Bank of China in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, fled after sending the huge sum to Canada in 2005.
7367	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Gao Shan and another suspect, Li Dongzhe, are currently under the surveillance of Canadian police, the report said.
7368	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The report quoted unidentified Canadian sources as saying that the extradition of the two suspects would not be difficult.
7370	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	According to the report, the accountants of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. reported on Jan. 4, 2005, that more than 293 million yuan had disappeared from the company's account at the Bank of China.
7372	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The total sum exceeded 1 billion yuan.
7373	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	On Jan. 13, 2005, Zhang Xiaoguang, former chairman of the board of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was charged with embezzlement of public funds and is awaiting trial in China.
7374	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	China has been active in seeking international cooperation in its fight against corruption.
7375	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Chinese prosecutors have brought about 70 criminal suspects back to China from foreign countries since 1998.
7376	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The successful extradition from the United States of a Guangdong Province branch head of the Bank of China in 2004 was lauded as a powerful deterrent to corruption.
7378	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Sources from the Ministry of Public Security said 800 suspects at large abroad were wanted for economic crimes.
7379	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	They are accused of embezzling a total sum of almost 70 billion yuan.
7380	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Zimbabwe deports 'coup mastermind' to E Guinea
7381	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The alleged British mastermind of a foiled coup in Equatorial Guinea has been deported there from Zimbabwe, even though he was still appealing against his extradition, court documents showed on Friday.
7382	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Simon Mann, an ex-SAS officer was placed on a military plane and flown out in the early hours of Thursday after being handed over to Equatorial Guinea officials, a senior immigration officer said in an affadavit seen by AFP.
7383	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	He had already served time in a Zimbabwean jail.
7384	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	But Mann's lawyer Jonathan Samkange said he had only learnt his client had already been flown out when he lodged legal papers on Friday relating to a final appeal against his deportation.
7385	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The idea was that by the time we filed a notice of appeal he would have gone.
7386	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	This was designed to defeat the notice of our appeal," Samkange told AFP.
7387	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"Deporting a person at night is not only mischievous but unlawful."
7389	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The lawyer had turned up at court on Friday morning to file the appeal papers when he was shown documents confirming the deportation order had been already carried out at the behest of acting attorney general Bharat Patel.
7390	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Patel was also one of the judges at the high court ruling.
7391	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Samkange said the authorities had deliberately concealed the fact Mann had been moved out of the Chikurubi maximum security prison, near Harare.
7394	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"On 31st January Thursday 2008 at about 0130 hours, I was informed by the police to process the extradition papers of Simon Mann as his appeal had been dismissed," Siziba wrote.
7395	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"I thereafter proceeded to collect the letter authorising the extradition of Simon Mann from the acting minister's (attorney general's) office and I was later accompanied by two police officers to collect Simon Mann" from prison.
7396	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann was then taken to the nearby Manyame air base and handed over to the Equatorial Guinea authorities who had a plane already waiting on the tarmac.
7397	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"They boarded an air force plane which took off about 0450 hours," said Siziba.
7398	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann's legal team applied on Friday for a court order for their client to be returned to Zimbabwe but the application was rejected by a high court judge.
7399	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The application has been dismissed because Simon Mann was deported before the appeal was noted at the supreme court," Julia Woods, another of the Briton's lawyers, told AFP after the hearing.
7400	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	An alumnus of Britain's famous Eton school, Mann was arrested with 61 others when their plane landed at Harare international airport in March 2004.
7401	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	They were accused of stopping off to pick up weapons from Harare while on their way to Malabo to oust President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, who has ruled the oil- rich Equatorial Guinea with an iron fist since 1979.
7402	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann said he and his co-accused were on their way to the Democratic Republic of Congo and needed the weapons for a security contract at a mine.
7403	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	He was sentenced to seven years in jail, but the term was later reduced.
7404	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Most of his co-accused were released from a Zimbabwean prison in 2005.
7405	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The case made headlines worldwide following the arrest in Cape Town in August 2004 of Mark Thatcher, the multi-millionaire son of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher on charges that he allegedly helped bankroll the abortive coup.
7406	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Thatcher pleaded guilty in South Africa to unwittingly helping finance the plot and was fined some 400,000 euros (510,000 dollars).
7407	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	He has since left the country.

7410	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	The Beijing Olympic Games organizers Wednesday launched a design competition in a bid to collect ideas for costumes used for the victory ceremony.
7411	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	The competition opened to both professionals and general public both at home and abroad, organizers said.
7412	XIN_ENG_20070523.0154.LDC2009T13	"This will be an open competition not only welcoming participants from China but also from abroad," said Lu Hao, vice mayor of Beijing.

7422	AFP_ENG_20080401.0679.LDC2009T13	The Chicago index, a measure of business activity in the US Midwest and considered a precursor to the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey, rose to 48.2 in March from 44.5 a month earlier, beating expectations.
7423	AFP_ENG_20080401.0679.LDC2009T13	However, dealers said they expected the market to lose momentum due to weak A-share markets on the mainland and the possibility of further tightening measures in China.

7427	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Tropical Storm Gustav surged toward hurricane force on Thursday as it drove toward Jamaica and aimed for the Cayman islands, prompting evacuations of tourists and offshore oil workers.
7428	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	In its wake, impoverished Haitians scrambled for food.
7429	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, New Orleans kept nervous watch, three years after Katrina's destruction.
7430	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Gustav -- the cause of flooding and mudslides that killed 23 in Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- was nearly stationary about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of Jamaica's low-lying capital, but it was expected to run west-southwest later in the day, very close to the shore.
7431	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Its top sustained winds were just below hurricane strength at about 70 mph (110 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
7432	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Tropical Storm Hanna formed in the Atlantic, northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
7433	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	It was too early to predict whether Hanna will threaten the United States, but Gustav was already causing jitters from Mexico's Cancun resort to the Florida panhandle.
7435	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Royal Dutch Shell PLC has evacuated nearly 400 people and said it will pull out another 270 Thursday, affecting production.
7436	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	BP PLC also removed personnel from the region that produces about a quarter of U.S. crude and much of its natural gas.
7437	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Transocean, the world's biggest offshore drilling contractor, is suspending operations at all of its rigs and pulling nearly 1,600 people out of the Gulf.
7438	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Some models showed Gustav taking a path toward Louisiana and other Gulf states devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita three years ago.
7440	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Emergency officials opened shelters and sent relief supplies to flood-prone areas.
7441	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Gustav hit Haiti as a hurricane on Tuesday, causing floods and landslides that killed 15 people on Haiti's deforested southern peninsula, where it dumped 12 inches (30 centimeters) or more of rain.
7442	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	A landslide buried eight people, including a mother and six of her children, in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
7443	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Gustav's projected track pointed directly at the Cayman Islands, an offshore banking center where residents boarded up homes and stocked up on emergency supplies.
7444	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Forecasters said Gustav might slip between Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba on Sunday, then March toward a Tuesday collision with the U.S. Gulf Coast -- anywhere from south Texas to the Florida panhandle.
7445	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"We know it's going to head into the Gulf.
7446	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	After that, we're not sure," said meteorologist Rebecca Waddington at the National Hurricane Center.
7447	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"For that reason, everyone in the Gulf needs to be monitoring the storm."
7448	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	New Orleans began planning a possible mandatory evacuation, hoping to prevent the chaos it saw after Hurricane Katrina struck three years ago Friday.
7449	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Mayor Ray Nagin left the Democratic National Convention in Denver to help the city prepare.
7451	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"A bad storm churning in the Gulf could be a nightmare scenario," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
7452	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"We might see oil prices spike US$5 to US$8 if it really rips into platforms."
7453	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were still getting heavy rain Thursday, and rising waters damaged many homes.
7454	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	In the low-lying Cayman Islands, where Gustav is expected to hit Friday, tourists flocked to the airport to get out before the storm.
7455	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Stacey McLaughlan of Albany, New York, said she and her husband were told to leave their resort by noon Thursday or prepare to move to a public shelter.
7456	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Cayman Airways pilot Chris Witt says a lot of evacuation flights are planned for Thursday, but McLaughlan said she and her husband had to pay an extra US$1,000 to get out because their airline refused to bring in a plane to return them to the U.S.
7457	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Finding affordable food was an immediate priority for many in Haiti.
7458	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Jean Ramando, an 18-year-old banana grower, said winds tore down a dozen of his family's banana trees, so bushels of 60 bananas they once sold to Port-au-Prince markets for 135 gourdes ($3.55) would have to be moved at prices as high as 300 gourdes ($7.80).
7459	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	"The wind blew them down quickly so we need to make some money quickly," he said as he carried bushels through floodwaters.
7460	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	In the Dominican Republic, friends and relatives buried a mother and six of her seven children, smothered when a landslide crushed their tin-roofed shack.

7462	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	A neighbor was also killed.

7464	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	SOME HOPE REPORT FINDING HPV IN MORE THAN 25% OF WOMEN DIFFUSES TENSION OVER CONTROVERSIAL CANCER VACCINE
7466	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer, health researchers say.
7467	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The study, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides the most comprehensive assessment of human papillomavirus prevalence among American women.
7469	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"We expected to find that this was a highly prevalent infection," said Dr. Eileen Dunne, a staff epidemiologist with CDC and chief author of the new study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
7471	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
7473	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
7474	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
7476	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry said his goal was to protect future generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000 women a year in this country.
7477	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry has been rebuked by social conservatives, who say his promotion of the vaccine condones pre-marital sex, as well as legislators who say he exceeded his constitutional powers by issuing the executive order.
7478	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The Texas Medical Association, too, has said the vaccine shouldn't be mandated, citing, in part, the high cost of the three-shot regimen, which starts at $360.
7479	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
7480	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
7481	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"... It's a shame that we can't focus on educating people about the benefits of this vaccine instead of just getting embroiled in the political intrigue," said Dr. Lawrence Stanberry, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
7482	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.

7724	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"In 2009 the company plans to produce 600 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year," it added.
7725	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	A company spokesperson confirmed that capital expenditure in 2008 had been 4.4 billion dollars.
7726	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	The meeting of the board of directors of TNK-BP Limited -- the holding company for the TNK-BP group -- came after an accord that ended months of wrangling between its shareholders over control of the firm.
7728	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	TNK-BP was founded in 2003 and is jointly owned 50 percent by British energy giant BP and a group of Russian billionaires known as Alfa Access-Renova (AAR) who include Mikhail Fridman and Viktor Vekselberg.
7729	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month CEO Robert Dudley resigned after Russian shareholders accused him of acting purely on behalf of BP's interests and hindering the expansion of the company abroad.
7730	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	Tim Summers had been appointed interim chief executive until a new appointment is agreed by the shareholders but the statement said that the nomination of a new permanent CEO was not on the agenda at the meeting.
7731	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"The Board also reviewed progress of the top management and governance transition currently underway inside TNK-BP."
7732	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	"However, there was no discussion or nomination of any individual candidate as the company’s next permanent CEO."
7733	AFP_ENG_20081211.0234.LDC2009T13	The Russian press has speculated that the new chief could be the former chief executive of Norilsk Nickel, Denis Morozov, who is said to be supported by both groups of shareholders.

7736	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Representatives from the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany will soon discuss the settlement of Iran's nuclear issue via telephone, a U. S. official said here Wednesday.
7737	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Officials of the six countries will consult possible action by the United Nations Security Council to stop Iran's sensitive nuclear work, said the official who asked not to be identified.
7739	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	Senior officials from the six countries discussed in mid- September over possible new sanctions against Iran as Tehran refuses to comply with United Nations resolutions.
7740	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	The United States and its European allies have been trying to push the United Nations to impose the fourth sanctions against Iran in a bid to force Tehran to give up its nuclear program.
7741	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its September report that due to Tehran's block, the UN nuclear watchdog had been unable to make much progress in investigating Iran's suspect nuclear program.
7742	XIN_ENG_20081008.0187.LDC2009T13	The United States and its allies have accused Iran of developing nuclear weapons, but Iran insists that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.

7747	APW_ENG_20080107.1008.LDC2009T13	The Writers Guild of America strike, which began Nov. 5, has effectively shut down Hollywood and cast a pall over Tinseltown's awards season.
7748	APW_ENG_20080107.1008.LDC2009T13	But the Critics' Choice Awards, presented by the Broadcast Film Critics Association at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, is not covered by guild contracts.

7758	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	JAKARTA, Indonesia 2007-12-06 09:30:08 UTC
7759	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Authorities have traced a piece of an airplane wing found on a runway at Indonesia's largest airport to a passenger jet operated by budget carrier Lion Air, the transport ministry said Thursday.
7760	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said the Boeing MD-90 had been grounded and authorities were investigating how and when the piece fell off.
7761	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Workers found the engine casing, which Ervan said was "several feet" in length, at Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta airport on Tuesday.
7763	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Last month, a similar-sized piece of wing fell from a jetliner minutes after it took off from the same airport.
7764	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	The Boeing 737, which was operated by a local airline, landed safely but the incident added to safety concerns about commercial aviation in Indonesia.
7766	APW_ENG_20071206.0470.LDC2009T13	Experts say the industry is plagued by poor maintenance, rule- bending and a shortage of trained professionals.

7769	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nigeria's top corruption investigator said Tuesday that up to six ex-governors will be charged by the end of the year, a major development in a country where having high-level connections has long offered a shield from prosecution.
7770	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nuhu Ribadu, chairman of Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, refused to identify the men, saying he is afraid "they will run."
7771	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	But, he said, up to six will face charges in the next two months.
7772	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Definitely more governors will be charged," Ribadu told The Associated Press in an interview at his office in the Nigerian capital.
7773	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Governors are so afraid, wherever they go now."
7775	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Many have been suspected of raiding public coffers -- and leaving their constituents impoverished -- while they hide their ill-gotten gains outside the country.
7776	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Under Nigeria's federal system, states receive much of the government's funds and are charged with providing schools, health clinics and other basic services to their people.
7777	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	State budgets can reach beyond US$1 billion per year, particularly in the southern oil region, where budgets are even higher and graft particularly rife.
7778	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Since President Umaru Yar'Adua took power in May, the EFCC has begun prosecuting five former governors and has won the conviction of one who had been previously charged.
7779	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	The crackdown is a signal to many in Nigeria that Yar'Adua is trying to make good on his pledge to stamp out graft in a country that is considered one of the most corrupt in the world.
7780	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"For us to win this war (against corruption), we have to start at the top and trickle down," said Ribadu, a former police officer and prosecutor who boasts that he sent more people to jail than anyone else in Nigeria.
7781	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	"Elites are the ones who destroy the rule of law," he added.
7782	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Ribadu's agency was set up in 2004 as part of an anti-corruption drive by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo.
7783	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	Nigeria is Africa's largest oil exporter and the fifth-largest supplier of crude to the United States.
7784	APW_ENG_20071023.0870.LDC2009T13	But despite producing tens of billions of dollars' (euros') worth of crude every year, few Nigerians have access to clean water or electricity.

7792	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	Kenya's tourism will turn to China and seek to develop its domestic market to inject new life in a sector battered by recent post-election violence, tourism officials said Thursday.
7793	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"China is an important market, a new market and a growing one," said Rebecca Nabutola, permanent secretary at the ministry of tourism and wildlife.
7795	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	While flights from Kenya's traditional tourism markets -- notably in Europe -- were halted or reduced following the eruption of post-election strife in late December, China did not issue travel advisories.
7796	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"We're not going to China in an attempt to rebuild our image... it was never really dented and tourist behaviour was not really affected," said Nabutola, part of a delegation heading to China next week to boost tourism.
7797	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	Tourism is the top foreign currency earning sector in Kenya and suffered from the worldwide attention attracted by the electoral dispute and ensuing cycle of tribal violence and revenge killings.
7798	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With a fast-growing middle-class, China -- the world's most populated country and its fourth largest economy -- is a coveted market for all top tourist destinations.
7799	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"There's also a lot of potential and a lot of interest that has come from India," the ministry official said.
7800	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	With cancellations from overseas tourists hitting around 90 percent in January, the ministry has launched a recovery programme which will also involve the development of domestic tourism.
7801	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	"If we want a sustainable tourism sector, we need a solid domestic base," Nabutola said.
7802	AFP_ENG_20080320.0377.LDC2009T13	The domestic market currently accounts for only 25 percent of the sector's revenue, a figure she said Kenya hoped to double.

7804	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-03-04 20:42:34 UTC
7805	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Anna Nicole Smith's daughter will inherit the former Playboy model's estate, a judge ruled Tuesday.
7806	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Eighteen-month-old Dannielynn Hope was named sole heir by Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff, who also set up a trust in the girl's name.
7807	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Her father, Larry Birkhead, and Smith's executor, Harry K. Stern, will be co-trustees.
7808	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Beckloff granted a petition filed by Stern, who wanted to clarify Smith's intentions toward her daughter.
7809	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Smith drafted a will in 2001 -- five years before the child was born -- that left her estate to her then-only son, Daniel.
7810	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	However, it said the assets in Daniel's trust should be shared equally if she had future children.
7811	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Daniel was 20 when he died in 2006, three days after Dannielynn was born.
7812	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	"We and Mr. Stern always believed that Anna Nicole never intended to disinherit her daughter," Stern's lawyer, Bruce S. Ross, said after the hearing.
7813	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	"I'm pleased to say this chapter in the saga is closed."
7814	APW_ENG_20080304.1376.LDC2009T13	Dannielynn could inherit millions of dollars if the estate wins an ongoing court fight over a will by Smith's wealthy second husband, J. Howard Marshall, that left much of his fortune to the model.
7818	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday the plan of direct U.S. stake in banks is focused on regulated firms, indicating unregulated firms such as hedge funds won't initially get government aid.
7819	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"We're focused on financial institutions, regulated financial institutions," Paulson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, when asked whether hedge funds might also be eligible.
7820	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"The program right now is for banks and thrifts," he was quoted as saying.
7821	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	Banking strains have hurt broader economic growth, pushing the United States toward a recession.
7822	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	"There's been a shock in the credit markets, and that's exacted a toll on the real economy," said Paulson.
7823	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that the U.S. economy faces "a number of tough months" ahead.
7824	XIN_ENG_20081016.0157.LDC2009T13	In a separate interview on Fox Business Network, Paulson insisted the Bush Administration is pursuing the correct course now to end the debacle.

7827	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	GALVESTON, Texas 2008-09-18 18:15:34 UTC
7828	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The barrier island community of Galveston is not ready for residents to return even briefly to the city thrashed by Hurricane Ike, officials said Thursday as they pleaded for at least another week to make repairs.
7829	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Ike's death toll in the U.S. stood at 53, with 19 in Texas.
7830	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	In the Caribbean, Ike killed more than 80 people.
7831	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Many of the city's services -- including water, sewer and power -- are recovering but remain several days away from returning to full function, City Manager Steve LeBlanc said.
7832	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The only hospital on the island is getting some power, but not enough to care for the 60,000 residents of Galveston Island.
7833	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The extra strain placed on the city by the return of residents would only slow the recovery effort, LeBlanc said.
7834	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We don't have adequate water at this point for just taking a shower, flushing a toilet," he said.
7835	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We're not there yet."
7836	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Authorities let residents and business owners back onto the island briefly Tuesday to "look and leave," but quickly reversed course after the decision created traffic jams that backed up for miles Tuesday and Wednesday on Interstate 45, the only road onto the island.
7837	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Officials ruled out a resumption of that policy Thursday.
7838	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"It's more confusing," Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said.
7839	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We just want to bring everyone home, and we'll try to do it next week."
7840	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Thomas told residents that by waiting they were "making it possible for us to get you home in a week or so, instead of the months it would take if the city's infrastructure were more overwhelmed at this point."
7841	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Roughly 15,000 residents defied forecasters' warning of "certain death" to ride out the storm on the barrier island, and many remained there despite the repeated urgings of officials -- worried about threats that include mosquito-borne disease -- to get out.
7842	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are clear signs of life returning to Galveston.
7844	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Galveston Police Chief Charles Wiley said since Ike hit, authorities have seen only 11 cases of looting -- a rate he called "phenomenally low."
7845	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are fears there are more victims yet to be found.

7891	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	A senior US official said Monday he discussed the latest sanctions imposed by Washington against Iran with officials in the United Arab Emirates, which is Tehran's top trading partner.
7892	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	"We shared with them some further specifics associated with the announcement several days ago" in order to "help them better understand the direction of US policy," Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David McCormick told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
7893	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The United States on Thursday announced new sanctions aimed at punishing Iran's nuclear ambitions and alleged sponsorship of terrorism.
7894	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The sanctions targeted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, accused of spreading weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the IRGC's elite Quds Force, which was designated as a supporter of terrorism.
7896	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick, who met with officials and investors in Abu Dhabi, did not go into details about the discussions on Iran.
7897	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	But he said Washington hoped the sanctions would "result in further action by other countries, will sensitise companies that are doing business with Iran to the potential risk of doing so and the fact that by doing so they may be further advancing these proliferation activities or terrorist financing activities."
7898	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick insisted that the sanctions were aimed at promoting a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff with Iran.
7899	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	Despite already being under UN sanctions, Tehran refuses to suspend its controversial programme of uranium enrichment, which the West fears to be a cover for atomic weapons development, a charge Iran denies.
7900	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick, who visited neighbouring Kuwait on Sunday, was due to meet on Tuesday with business leaders in Dubai, a business hub for Iran.
7901	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The oil-rich UAE, a US ally, is by far Iran's largest global trade partner.
7902	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	The Iranian Business Council (IBC) in Dubai puts the number of Iranian companies operating in the city state at close to 10,000.
7903	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	It estimates accumulated assets of Iranians in the UAE to be about 300 billion dollars, while trade between the UAE and Iran reached about 11 billion dollars in 2006.
7904	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick said the primary purpose of his talks in the Gulf was to "reinforce the theme that America is open to investment," given that "there are some concerns in the region about the openness of the US economy."

7906	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	NASSAU, Bahamas 2007-03-21 16:54:57 UTC
7907	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	DNA tests to identify the father of Anna Nicole Smith's infant daughter may not resolve legal struggles over custody of the girl, a lawyer for Smith's former partner said Wednesday.
7908	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Howard K. Stern, who has been caring for 6-month-old Dannielynn in the Bahamas, was complying with the court ordered tests, but may not relinquish custody even they prove the father is Smith's ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead, attorney James Neavitt said.
7909	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"Howard is the legal father.
7911	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Neavitt did open the possibility of a negotiated settlement if the test proves his client is not the biological father.
7916	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	At the gated, waterfront home where he lived with Smith, Stern drove away with Dannielynn on Wednesday morning, then returned later without speaking to reporters.
7918	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Frederic von Anhalt, the husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor, also says he may be Dannielynn's father.
7920	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Another contender for custody is Smith's mother Virgie Arthur, who says she could provide a more stable home than Stern and has asked the court to name her Dannielynn's guardian.
7922	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	The girl, Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, could inherit millions from the estate of Smith's late husband, Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II.
7923	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Smith had been fighting Marshall's family over his estimated US$500 million (euro380 million) fortune since his death in 1995.

7926	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	BANGKOK, Thailand 2007-09-14 04:00:19 UTC
7927	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	By most accounts, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System passed its first big test, with the massive earthquakes in Indonesia providing the perfect opportunity for drills from Asia to Africa.
7929	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Similar warnings reached governments as far away as Bangladesh and Kenya, where coastal residents and tourists were ushered off beaches with megaphones and onto higher ground.
7930	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They were quite fast in delivering the warning.
7932	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"The president announced the system will be ready in 2008, but this earthquake showed it's working already."
7935	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The 2004 tsunami hit southern Thailand, including the tourist resort of Phuket, and killed more than 8,000 people.
7936	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People in the southern provinces heard warnings from other centers abroad and were panicking," Smith Dharmasaroja, director of the National Disaster Warning Center, told Thai TV viewers when he broke into regular programming to make an emergency address.
7937	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	For some experts, however, the performance highlighted progress many governments in the region have made since the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster which left 230,000 dead.
7942	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, Indonesia, which was hit hardest by the 2004 disaster, has installed dozens of tidal gauges and deep-ocean tsunami monitoring buoys to detect waves as well as more than 150 seismometers to detect earthquakes.
7943	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It has vastly improved its communication network, resulting in a quake alert going out within minutes of the actual temblor.
7944	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The quake was detected on a seismograph which relays a message to the country's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency.
7945	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It then sent a warning to hundreds of emergency management personnel in the disaster-hit regions.
7946	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Tsunami alerts managed to reach remote areas including coastal communities in Australia's northwestern territories of Christmas and Cocos Islands, India's Andaman Islands, as well as beachfront communities in Sri Lanka severely damaged by the 2004 tsunami.
7947	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	G.G. Somaratne from Payagala, a southern coastal town in Sri Lanka, said that all his neighbors were panic-stricken when the tsunami warning came.
7948	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"We took all our valuable goods to the second floor of a neighbor, carried whatever we could take and went to a relative's home some seven miles away," said Somaratne, who is still rebuilding his beachside home destroyed in 2004.
7949	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People were in temples and churches, relatives and friends, and returned after the warning was lifted, but some are still scared to come back," he said.
7950	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In Bangladesh, volunteers with bullhorns warned villagers to evacuate to higher or inland areas, while local television and radio stations issued warnings as town halls opened control rooms to monitor the situation.
7951	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In the southern sea resort town of Cox's Bazar, tourists were evacuated to inland hotels while the country's national soccer team -- holding a training camp -- was rushed off to a hilltop guest house.
7952	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Indonesian communities were praised for responding to alerts by rushing to higher ground.
7953	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"I understand that there has been a lot of public awareness in Padang and Bengkulu," said Richard Whelden, deputy mission director for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bangkok.
7954	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People didn't run to the water," after the quakes, he said.
7956	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The point is that people responded, which is something that wouldn't have happened two years ago."
7958	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Associated Press writers Rungrawee C. Pinyorat in Bangkok, Anthony Deutsch in Padang, Tofayel Ahmed in Bangladesh and Krishan Francis in Sri Lanka contributed to this report.

7961	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Country music star John Rich wants like-minded voters to join him in "Raising McCain."
7962	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The other half of the Nashville duo Big and Rich, the singer- songwriter has penned lyrics for a rock-infused anthem focused on the 5 1/2 years Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his refusal of an early release.
7963	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He stayed strong, stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out.
7964	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Now we've got a real man with an American plan, we're going to put him in the big White House," the song says.
7965	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Its refrain: "We're all just raising McCain" -- a play on the phrase "raising Cain" that refers to causing trouble.
7966	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich, 34, planned to debut "Raising McCain" on Friday at the Country First concert in Panama City, Florida, with McCain on hand.
7967	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	In an interview, Rich said he hadn't been involved in politics before but got excited about the Arizona senator's campaign.
7968	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	He finished the song about a month ago and sent it to McCain's daughter Meghan, who sent it onto campaign officials.
7969	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"I wanted to offer him something that he didn't have, a rally song, one that really captures that maverick spirit," Rich said.
7970	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich said McCain's Vietnam experience motivated him to compose the song, which he planned to offer on his Web site without charge.
7971	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"This guy is a hero," Rich said.
7972	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He was physically tortured for years, and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades."
7973	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas composed a song for Obama, "Yes We Can," and enlisted celebrities like actress Scarlett Johansson and singer John Legend to perform and sing.
7974	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The song became an online sensation, drawing more than 8 million hits on YouTube alone.
7975	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich said that while he admired Obama and was "proud as an American" that a black candidate was on the verge of winning the Democratic nomination, he disagreed with the Illinois senator on most major issues and felt he didn't have enough experience to be president.
7976	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"The entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us," Rich said.
7977	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"National security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues.
7978	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us safe."

7985	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Vietnam and North Korea Saturday signed agreements on sharing agricultural technology and cultural exchanges during a meeting between their prime ministers Nguyen Tan Dung and Kim Yong-Il.
7986	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Kim arrived in Hanoi on Friday for a five-day official visit to Pyongyang's ideological ally, which comes just after Vietnamese Communist Party leader Nong Duc Manh's trip to North Korea.
7987	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Hanoi and Pyongyang would "exchange candid views on the matters of further strengthening and developing bilateral relations as well as other issues of mutual concern," the North Korean delegation said in a statement.
7988	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	It stressed that the two countries had "a long history and excellent tradition of friendship and cooperation with each other."
7989	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	The Vietnamese army paper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said Kim's visit "demonstrates the wish to give a boost to cooperation between the two countries."
7992	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Vietnam and North Korea, which have both fought against the United States, remain allies in politics and ideology.
7993	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	But South Korea has become a leading foreign investor in Vietnam, which opened up to the world in 1986 and since then has seen speedy economic growth and international integration.
7994	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	During his visit, the North Korean prime minister is due to visit the Ha Tu coal mines in the northeast of the country, where he is also expected to go to the scenic tourist spot of Halong Bay.

7997	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England coach Brian Ashton was far from satisfied despite seeing his side begin the warm-up for the defence of their World Cup title with a record 62-5 rout of Wales at Twickenham.
7999	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England outmuscled Wales up front, their pack utterly dominant and the 57-point margin of victory was the best in Anglo-Welsh Test history surpassing England's 50-10 win at Twickenham in 2002.
8000	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	But despite their try count concerns remained about England's attacking threat beyond the close-quarter exchanges with a couple of scores botched by poor handling and a failure to utilise overlaps.
8001	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	England, who could meet Wales in the quarter-finals of the World Cup, which starts next month, are sure to face a sterner test when tournament hosts France visit Twickenham on August 11 and Ashton said there was still room for England, who've won just five of their last 17 Tests, to improve.
8005	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	One longstanding criticism of England is that they place too much reliance on their pack and, as a consequence, can come unstuck when they face top-class sides such as New Zealand, the World Cup favourites, and South Africa who can match them physically.
8008	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	There was a real mixture," he said.
8010	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"There's not much point whizzing the ball all over the park when you are five metres out and you've got a pack that can score without passing it.
8011	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"The good news was we showed quite a bit of balance to our game.
8012	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half and our kicking game came into play with our last two tries."
8014	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	Perry, told to lose weight by Ashton during England's 2-0 series defeat against South Africa in June, was named man-of-the-match and the England coach also praised the midfield duo of debutant Dan Hipkiss and former Great Britain rugby league captain Andy Farrell
8015	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He has worked incredibly hard after a pretty informal chat in South Africa about his body shape," said Ashton of Perry.
8016	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"He looks a better player for it.
8018	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He very rarely makes mistakes, his distribution is good and he puts players through holes.
8019	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He played like Andy Farrell can play.
8022	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	That is pressure at the highest level, coming in for his first cap, knowing you have to make a statement otherwise you might not get selected for the World Cup.

8027	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va., farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a well.
8029	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
8033	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
8036	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``You're going to get me in trouble,'' Bob Leazer, of Leazer Brothers Drilling and Pump Co., based in Remington in Fauquier County, Va., responded when asked if he employs dowsers to locate the wells his company drills in 13 Virginia counties.
8037	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``I've seen a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've seen 'em miss.
8038	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	And I can't say if it works.''
8039	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Some people decry dowsing as the handiwork of the devil
8040	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
8041	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Others, in the name of rational skepticism, just call it bunk.
8042	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
8043	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
8044	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
8045	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His father preferred fresh limbs cut from a cherry or willow tree, but Shirley uses brass rods to pinpoint and drill where he believes underground streams cross -- a prime location for a multigallon-per-minute well.
8047	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Detractors say there's no hard proof that the method works.
8048	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself ``strongly opposed'' to the practice.
8049	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Experiments have shown that the odds of finding water through dowsing are no better than random attempts and that rods lack special powers, said Cliff Treyens, the association's public awareness director.
8050	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
8051	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His company, which works on Northern Virginia projects, uses satellite imagery and seismic and geophysical tools to find potential well sites.
8052	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
8054	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting groundwater wherever one digs.

8093	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Indonesia is failing to protect millions of domestic workers, some as young as 12, who face long hours, potentially deadly beatings and sexual abuse, Amnesty International said in a report released Wednesday.
8094	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The estimated 2.6 million domestic workers in Indonesia are generally considered second-class citizens, the London-based rights watchdog said.
8095	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Too many women domestic workers in Indonesia ... face human rights abuses at work," said the report entitled Exploitation and abuse: the plight of women domestic workers.
8096	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Often forced to work from as young as 12 years of age, they suffer economic exploitation and poor working conditions, as well as gender-based discrimination.
8098	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some are even killed."
8099	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The report details cases of women and girls who were abused, raped and even beaten to death by their employers.
8100	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty said their plight often remained hidden, as they were ashamed of talking about their experiences, and the authorities and general public appeared oblivious to them.
8102	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some 640,000 Indonesians work abroad, mostly as maids, with Malaysia one of the top destinations.
8103	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"We often think of domestic workers as people travelling out of Indonesia to other countries, but there is a large population of Indonesian domestic workers in their own country, who are not recognised by law," Amnesty International Malaysia executive director Josef Roy Benedict told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
8104	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"This means they are not able to form trade unions or get any help legally."
8105	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Government moves to address the problem were falling short, the report said, "leaving millions of women vulnerable to abusive employers."
8106	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	While the government had submitted a draft law on domestic workers, it omitted basic rights given to other workers such as limits on working hours and a minimum wage, and most people were also unaware that a law on domestic violence applied to maids, Amnesty said.
8107	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Like every other human being, domestic workers have rights -- including the right to be free from violence, the right to rest and the right to be paid an adequate wage.

8223	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Lebanon is facing its most serious political crisis since the end of the 1975-90 civil war, with the Western-backed government and the Hezbollah-led opposition locked in a fierce power struggle.
8224	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Rival Lebanese politicians have not met since a national dialogue conference ended last year without agreement.
8225	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The crisis has taken on an increasingly sectarian tone and has erupted into street clashes between supporters of pro- and anti- government factions in recent months, killing 11 people.
8226	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	One of the opposition's key demands is the creation of a new national unity government in which it has veto power.
8227	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The existing government has so far resisted such a move.
8229	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The legislature must vote on a replacement for pro-Syrian Lahoud, but it is highly unlikely that Lebanon's divided leaders can agree on a candidate -- threatening a power vacuum, or even worse the creation of two rival governments.
8231	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The latest victim was anti-Syrian lawmaker Walid Eido, who was killed along with his son, two bodyguards and six passers-by last week in a car bombing in Beirut.
8232	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The Lebanese army has also been battling al-Qaida-inspired militants barricaded in a Palestinian refugee camp in northern Lebanon for over a month.
8233	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"There is a chance for all (parties) to sit together and reach an understanding on the country's problems," Moussa said.
8234	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"Dialogue is a right, a duty and is in the interest of all the Lebanese," he said.
8235	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	"The absence of dialogue harms Lebanon's interest."
8237	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the proposed agenda for the dialogue provided "elements" for a solution to the political crisis.
8238	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	He said the Arab League would continue its efforts, including contacts with regional and international powers, to help the Lebanese reach a solution to the crisis.
8239	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa, leading an Arab League delegation, arrived here Tuesday in an attempt to help rival politicians end the monthslong political crisis.
8240	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Parliament is not functioning and the government just barely, after a quarter of Cabinet members resigned.
8241	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Opposition supporters have been holding a sit-in outside Prime Minister Fuad Saniora's office since Dec. 1, calling for his resignation and the formation of a new government.
8242	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Saniora, backed by the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, the United States and the West, has refused to step down.
8243	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	Moussa said he would soon hold talks with Syria, which strongly supports the opposition's demand for a new government.
8244	APW_ENG_20070623.0029.LDC2009T13	The Arab League delegation was dispatched to Beirut after a foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo last week in the wake of Eido's assassination, which his supporters blamed on Syria.

8249	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Cars, bank notes and TVs were going up in flames one chilly winter morning in the parking lot of Universal Chung Wah Funeral Home in Alhambra, 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
8251	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	One by one, the items were thrown into the fire licking out of a 4-by-4-foot wheeled container, charred from years of use.
8253	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Chinese mourners have been burning funeral paper -- known as joss paper, or dzi-dzat -- for centuries.
8255	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Practitioners of the ritual, derived from a mix of Taoism, Buddhism and regional folklore, believe that burning paper money equates to making advance deposits into an afterlife bank account that the deceased's spirit can access in heaven.
8257	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Shops also offer deep discounts during Ghost Month, often referred to as the Chinese version of Halloween, which this year begins Aug. 1.
8260	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Chinese immigrants who arrived in the U.S. between the 1950s and the 1970s are beginning to die, and their relatives are flocking to funeral homes to brush up on the ritual.
8261	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"For some people who cannot buy the actual items, they pursue the desire in the paper-goods form," said Xin Zhao, a professor of international marketing at the University of Hawaii.
8262	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"It's like vicariously having them."
8263	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lately, Southern California Chinese have become very particular about what they take to heaven, opting for fashionable upgrades of older dzi-dzat models, funeral workers said.
8265	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	It also explains why mourners purchase paper laptops: so their dead kin can keep track of the paper credit cards that came with them.
8266	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	At Lam's funeral in December, several paper cars, including a gray sedan with a red-jacketed chauffeur behind the plastic windshield, were parked on the altar amid mounds of pears, apples and pomelo.
8267	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam was a simple man with a gentle soul, according to his son, Konn Lam, 37.
8268	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Born in Guangzhou, China, he got married in Vietnam, raised his four children in Hong Kong and moved to Alhambra in the 1980s.
8270	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Now, Lam's family wanted to give him all the luxuries that eluded him in life.
8271	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Before relatives stepped outside the funeral home to burn the paper offerings, Buddhist monks chanted sutras to allow Lam to travel peacefully to Buddha's world.
8272	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	White flowers framed a large photo of Lam on an altar, which about 25 mourners approached with incense sticks, bowing as the sutras continued playing over speakers.
8276	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Within minutes, the intricate models settled into ash.
8277	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The mourners bowed three times toward the bin, then went back inside to finish the funeral.
8278	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Paper funeral goods can be found in Los Angeles' Chinatown, as well as in Chinese enclaves in the area.
8279	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A wide variety of paper goods -- kitchen utensils, trendy paper pumps -- are strung up like pinatas over spreads of candles and religious figurines.
8280	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Red-wrapped boxes of paper dim-sum dumplings crowd shelves next to a paper rice cooker with a removable lid and treasure boxes brimming with paper playing cards.
8281	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In one corner of the Commonwealth Trading Co. in Chinatown, near a paper bathroom scale shrouded in plastic, the screen of a boxy gray paper TV with a "multi-system Penesonic" label shows a printed panorama of an Asian city.
8282	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Perched nearby, a papier-mache tabby with plastic whiskers and a lush coat of paper strips glares through beaded eyes at a paper microwave.
8283	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Owner Carol Kwan, 42, drifted among her clientele -- mostly middle-aged women chattering in Cantonese -- as she pointed out a hollow $25 "Afterlife Airlines" airplane emblazoned with a blue phoenix emblem.
8284	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The paper products usually cost between $5 and $30, she said.
8285	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In the back of a dark shelf in Kwan's shop, a bulky blue paper land-line phone with a removable receiver collects dust.
8286	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A more prominently displayed set features a sleek black cell phone with a "Moropalo" sticker that is similar to Motorola's logo.
8287	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The pack also includes paper batteries, a charger and a pager with lucky 6's and 8's splashed across the screen.

8291	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the U.S., as is the pool of qualified artisans, she said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.

8293	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Mourners in Asia certainly have no problem burning -- literally -- through money.
8294	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In affluent Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Macau, they want their dead to live a good afterlife, sending lavish models of paper villas with manicured gardens, cutouts of security guards and full-size replicas of BMW motorcycles up in flames.
8296	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The air pollution from burning paper also don't help, said Zhao, the professor.
8297	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Communist government has also commented on what it views as inappropriate items for burning.
8299	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In April 2006, China's deputy secretary of the Ministry of Civil Affairs prohibited the burning of "adult" items such as paper condoms, karaoke hostesses and Viagra.
8300	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	U.S. funeral directors and merchants predict the ritual is headed for a downturn, however, as the community becomes more assimilated.
8301	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Younger, American-born Chinese avoid Kwan's shop, she said, because many do not understand the paper-burning tradition.
8302	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"Even though Chinese people are willing to pay more for funerals, I'm worried that fewer people will be buying the paper goods," she said.

8371	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	Israel will benefit by having a democratic Palestinian state that works for peace, U.S. President George W. Bush said Monday.
8372	XIN_ENG_20081125.0212.LDC2009T13	"We strongly believe that Israel will benefit by having a Palestinian state, a democracy on her border that works for peace," Bush said before a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the White House.

8382	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	A former speaker of parliament has denounced reports that Iranian MPs are being offered government cash to vote against impeaching the interior minister, who lied about his education, the Mehr news agency said Friday.
8383	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	"God save us from money being given to a deputy asking him to vote for or against someone or for or against a bill," said Gholam-Ali Hadad Adel, who headed parliament from 2004 until he stepped down earlier this year.
8384	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	Hadad Adel's remarks come two days after a stormy incident in parliament, in which media reported that a conservative deputy slapped the government's parliamentary representative, accusing him of vote buying.
8385	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	According to the reports, MPs were being offered cheques for 50 million rials (5,215 dollars, 4,085 euros), ostensibly to benefit mosques in their districts.
8386	AFP_ENG_20081031.0279.LDC2009T13	However, they were asked to sign an undertaking not to vote to censure Interior Minister Ali Kordan.

8407	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The United States and Norway also have claims in the Arctic, and the U.S. says the passage is not Canadian.
8408	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"It is a strait for international navigation," U.S. Ambassador David Wilkins said in an interview.
8410	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	That is the view shared by a majority of the countries in the world."
8414	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Harper has said Canada's new military installations will help back up Canada's claim to the waters and natural resources of the Northwest Passage, which runs below the North Pole from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the Arctic archipelago.
8415	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Stephen Clarkson, a political scientist at the University of Toronto, said bringing up the Arctic is a way for Harper to show Canadians he's not too close to the unpopular president.
8416	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"It's a gratuitous way to create a little distance between himself and Bush," Clarkson said.
8417	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Bush will meet privately with Calderon at Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello, a small summer retreat on the banks of the Ottawa river.
8418	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The U.S. government is poised to offer a major aid plan to Mexico to fight drug trafficking and violence.
8419	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Bush may announce part or all the proposal during the summit if the details are completed in time.
8420	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The effort is expected to help pay for equipment and training.
8421	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	For Bush, the summit with Canada and Mexico allows him to show he does not take his neighbors for granted
8422	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	they are both vital trading partners and energy providers for the U.S.
8423	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	"The message for Canada and Mexico is that despite the ongoing emphasis on Iraq and terrorism in U.S. foreign policy ... the U.S. is investing time and attention on relationships with our own region," said Chris Sands, a scholar of North American studies and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
8424	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The partnership of the countries is a framework for working out problems -- not a deal that was ever intended to produce dramatic announcements.
8425	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	None are expected at the summit.
8426	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Personally, Bush shares plenty of views with Harper and Calderon, two fellow conservatives and free-market advocates who have come into power during his second term.
8427	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	It is not all cheery.
8428	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The summit is drawing protests from critics of Canada's troop presence in Afghanistan and of the partnership among the three countries.
8429	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Some Canadians see it as an insidious threat to their sovereignty, led by the United States.
8430	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	Police were out in force Sunday in Ottawa, where protests began even before Bush was to arrive Monday from his ranch in Crawford, Texas.
8431	APW_ENG_20070820.0711.LDC2009T13	The summit itself will take place about 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the east at a luxury resort in Montebello, Quebec, where security is even tighter.

8478	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain Moves to Soften the Tone at Rallies, if Not in Ads
8480	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences with Obama.
8481	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the United States.
8482	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We want to fight and I want to fight, but we will be respectful," McCain said, again prompting loud boos when he declared that he admires Obama's accomplishments.
8484	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... That doesn't mean you have to reduce your ferocity.
8485	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It's just got to be respectful."
8486	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At one point in the event, McCain grabbed back the microphone from an elderly woman who had begun to say that she didn't like Obama because he is an Arab.
8488	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	No, ma'am," McCain said.
8490	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was mentioned.
8491	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
8493	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's allies and advertising unleashed a flurry of attacks on his rival's ethics, touting Obama's ties to a Vietnam War-era radical and accusing him of being connected to a group accused of engaging in voter fraud.
8494	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	He launched a tough new television ad linking Obama to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which bombed U.S. facilities in protest of the Vietnam War.
8495	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
8496	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of that relationship."
8497	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At the town hall, McCain promised not to relent on tying Obama to Ayers, telling the crowd, "We'll be talking about that more."
8498	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning will backfire.
8499	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"They can run misleading ads.
8501	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It will not work.
8502	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Not this time," Obama said.
8503	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
8504	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses, a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and complement what has already been done for major financial institutions.
8506	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on Obama's character.
8508	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We don't think the election is something that should be stolen from the American electorate," Davis said, urging Obama to join him in calling for federal investigations and media inquiries into ACORN and its ties to Obama.
8510	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
8511	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad, in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks, intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business."
8512	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It says ACORN stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to ACORN run long and deep.
8514	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a lawyer.
8515	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They said his work as an organizer in 1992 was not connected to the group.
8517	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented challenges facing their families and our nation."
8518	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
8520	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter registration forms that they collect.
8521	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But, in many states the law requires them to submit forms to election officials even if they contain suspect information.

8543	XIN_ENG_20070215.0225.LDC2009T13	GAZA, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) - Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haneya has officially presented his resignation before President Mahmoud Abbas in a meeting held on Thursday night in Gaza City.

8557	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	There are some things that a girl just can't get along without on the big day.
8558	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	But even the necessities can be made nice:
8559	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Specs
8560	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Those funky, chunky black specs that define you as a cultural creative in the office might be a bit too jarring for your wedding get-up.
8561	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you need eyeglasses, are disinclined to wear contact lenses and think prenuptial vision correction surgery falls into the category of budget-buster, think about picking out some special frames for the big day.
8562	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Heidi Tanner, manager of DisRespectacles in Denver, says some women can pull off an over-the-top frame, but she typically steers brides-to-be toward frames that are "a little more minimal, softer and feminine."
8563	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Pick from a lineup of new jeweled frames, or select a vintage frame.
8564	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Among Tanner's favorites at the moment is a white Vivia frame, studded with silver sparkles, handmade in France by Francis Klein.
8565	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	They run about $515, not including lenses.
8566	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Vintage frames are less expensive, averaging around $125 in the eyeglasses store, and are way less expensive if you shop at garage sales or thrift stores.
8567	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Expect to spend about $160 for lenses.
8570	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Old frames can be very fragile, so if you've chosen vintage frames, select an optician who has experience with old specs and will handle your glasses with lots of TLC.
8571	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Hair
8572	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Whether you're veiling up or approaching your vows bareheaded, chances are good you'll want some kind of hair ornament, possibly including fresh blooms.
8573	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you're thinking of adding flowers to your 'do, make sure to do a trial run with the hairstylist.
8574	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you have very short hair and don't plan to have a pro help with styling, a trial run is especially critical.
8575	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"You can definitely overwhelm yourself with flowers," says Teresa Henry, owner of Boulder Blooms, a top wedding-flower design studio in Boulder, Colo. "If the bride will do the whole trial run thing, with the hairstylist, and hairpiece, they know exactly what they're getting."
8576	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If a test run isn't in the budget, spend time going over -- in excruciating detail -- what you want from a headpiece.
8577	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Henry says she also tries to develop combs and pins that can be placed in the bride's 'do right before the ceremony or pictures.
8578	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"We try to design it in a way that can be placed on styled hair right at the end," she says.
8579	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"Freshness is always an issue when you're working in heat and sun."
8580	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Don't get hung up on a particular bloom until you talk to a florist.
8581	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	The flowers you fell in love with in pictures taken for bridal magazines might not survive in searing summer heat.
8583	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	So you've pored over grandma's jewelry box and picked the perfect piece to wear on your wedding day but realize that clip-on earrings make your lobes throb or the necklace dips too deeply into your d?colletage.
8584	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	What to do?
8585	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	See a custom jeweler.
8586	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Colin Miller, production manager at Master Goldsmith in Boulder, says that if your vintage piece is a good quality metal, fixing its style flaws is relatively simple.
8587	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And don't be afraid to ask for help with costume jewelry.

8625	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said the operators of the Crandall Canyon Mine had failed to report repeated collapses at the facility which meant inspectors were unable to assess practices at the facility.

8628	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	In a statement, Richard Stickler, assistant secretary of labor for the MSHA, said the tragedy had stemmed from mine operator Genwal Resource's "reckless failure" to report three previous coal "outbursts", including one just three days before the initial incident on August 6.
8629	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	"These reporting failures were critical, because they deprived MSHA of the information it needed to properly assess the operator's mining plans," Stickler said in a statement.

8852	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Whether planning to drive up the beach on South Padre Island in Texas or on the red-rock trails of Utah's stunningly beautiful Arches National Park, the newest generation of the Jeep Wrangler might very well be the best way to go.
8853	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
8854	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Jeep rolled out the redesigned Wrangler, whose roots can be traced back to the military jeeps used by the U.S. armed forces during World
8855	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	War II.
8857	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable doors.
8858	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Another innovation: Jeep added the first four-door version to the lineup with the redesign -- the model called the Wrangler Unlimited.
8861	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What's important is that the Wrangler's styling remains true to the brand, something Chrysler's designers clearly understood when they created the new generation.
8867	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family.
8869	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
8872	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
8873	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it -- 46.4 cubic feet.
8877	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The newest Wrangler has more ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems.
8879	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and the Rubicon.
8880	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield combinations, Jeep said.
8881	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base price $28,190 plus $700 freight).
8882	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Ours didn't come with the optional hardtop or the glass power windows
8883	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	we had the canvas top, traditional half-doors and zip-down plastic windows.
8884	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	We didn't have the power door locks, either.
8885	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What we did have was the Rubicon's great off-road equipment, which includes
8887	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter.
8889	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wranglers -- both the two- and four-door models -- come with a choice of removable hard or soft tops.
8891	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A new "Sunrider" soft top includes a sunroof feature that allows it to open partially.
8895	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.
8896	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	EPA ratings are 15 miles per gallon city/19 highway with either gearbox for the four-wheel-drive models and 15/20 for the two- wheel-drive model.
8898	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Nine exterior colors are offered, and wheel choices include 16-, 17- and 18-inch versions.
8899	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three skid plates are included on four-wheel-drive models to protect the fuel tank, transfer case and automatic transmission oil pan from rocks and logs.
8900	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	X and Sahara four-wheel-drive models come with Jeep's second- generation Command-Trac part-time, two-speed transfer case.
8901	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A Trac-Lok limited-slip rear differential is optional.
8902	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The only extras on our test vehicle were the automatic transmission ($825), navigation system ($1,275), trailer-towing package ($270) and "deep water blue pearl coat" paint ($225).
8904	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The trailer package now includes Trailer Sway Control, which Jeep says monitors the vehicle's movement relative to the driver's intended path and activates the stability control system if the trailer begins to sway.

8907	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD -- A suicide bomber detonated a car full of explosives in the historic booksellers' district of Baghdad Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring 65 others, police officials said.
8909	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack in the book market raised questions about the effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in the capital but not the number of car bombings.
8910	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep black smoke billowing above the city.
8911	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Glass littered the roadway in the booksellers' district, known for its historic buildings including former government offices, and as the place where intellectuals once gathered in the city.
8912	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The bomb exploded next to a printing shop, sending sheets of paper blowing into the air and littering the street with smoldering bundles of envelopes.
8913	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Firefighters at the scene tried to get the flames under control, but the blaze flared up repeatedluy because of all the paper.
8915	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	British officials said the raid uncovered about 30 prisoners, some showing signs of torture.
8916	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	News of the raid on Sunday, with its resonant themes of torture and sectarian-driven conflict, appeared to catch Iraq's central government by surprise, and raised new questions about the rule of law in the Shiite-dominated south, where less than two weeks ago Britain announced plans for a significant reduction in its forces because of improved stability.
8918	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	It was condemned on Sunday by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a conservative Shiite, who said nothing publicly about the evidence of torture.

8923	APW_ENG_20070705.0756.LDC2009T13	The female guest opened the freezer while helping to clear up after a dinner with a group of friends Tuesday at the man's home in the city of Verviers, 125 kilometers (78 miles) east of Brussels, said Christine Wilwerth of the city prosecutor's office.

8936	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	Royal Philips Electronics NV, one of Europe's largest electronics makers, said Monday it expects to more than double profitability by 2010 as it reorganizes the company into three main divisions.
8937	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The maker of medical and lighting equipment said in a statement it expects to raise profitability by 7.5 percent and rearrange its units.

8947	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	The 54-year-old left Khartoum Monday evening and arrived in Britain on an overnight flight from Dubai, accompanied by two British Muslim members of the House of Lords who helped secure her pardon by Sudan's President Omar al-Beshir.

8949	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	"I was very upset to think that I may have caused offence to people, very, very upset about it," she told an impromptu news conference at a VIP lounge in the airport terminal.

8952	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	"It has been an ordeal but I was well treated in prison and everyone was very kind to me," she told reporters.
8954	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	I had a fabulous time.

8970	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 2007-10-17 18:11:37 UTC
8971	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The St. Petersburg legislature approved Wednesday the construction of a skyscraper that will tower near the architectural treasures of Russia's Imperial-era capital, a project that has drawn protests from many residents.
8972	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The city assembly adopted legislation providing for the construction of a mixed-use complex anchored by a glass-encased tower that is to rise 320 meters (1,050 feet), more than twice as high as the stately city's current tallest building.
8974	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	And anger over the plans was a major draw during a handful of protests held by Russia's struggling political opposition in St. Petersburg over the past year.
8975	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Critics say the building would be a massively discordant element on the mostly low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg.
8976	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	They cite rules dating back centuries that have limited the height of buildings in the center of city founded by Czar Peter the Great more than 300 years ago.
8977	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Proponents argue that the site is not in the historical center.
8978	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The law approved by the predominantly pro-Kremlin city legislature sought to appease opponents by decreasing the amount the city will pay to about 25 billion rubles (US$1 billion
8979	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro700 million) instead of the entire projected construction cost of 60 billion rubles (US$2.4 billion
8980	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	euro1.7 billion), as previously planned.
8981	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Gazprom's oil subsidiary, OAO Gazpromneft, will pay most of the rest, officials said.
8982	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	Mikhail Amosov, a former head of the assembly's architecture and planning committee and a leader of opposition to the project, said the change in the financing scheme was good news but the city should not be paying anything.
8983	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	He expressed hope that lawmakers would bring the height of the tower to 100 meters (328 feet) or less.
8984	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	But Vatanyar Yagya, a legislator from the dominant United Russia party, said the law was final and the architectural plans would not be altered.
8985	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	"Okhta ... will be located not in the city's historical center but at least 500 meters (550 yards) from it," Yagya said.
8986	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	"When people refer to the czar's height rules, it's about the past ... In such big cities as Moscow and St. Petersburg there can be only two lines in construction decisions -- high up or deep down."
8987	APW_ENG_20071017.1247.LDC2009T13	The complex is to be built by 2016.

8990	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	Rio's Vasco beat Pernambuco state's Sport Recife 4-0 in the tenth round of the Brazilian League on Thursday night.
8991	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	With the victory, Vasco reached the seventh place in the championship, with 14 points.
8992	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	Sport fell two positions, and is now in 16th place, one position from the relegation zone.
8993	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	In the Brazilian League, the last four teams are relegated to the second division.
8994	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	Sport had the best moves in the beginning of the game, but Vasco, in the first home match under new president Roberto Dinamite, got better opportunities to score before the 35-minute goal by midfielder Morais assisted by Edmundo.
8995	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	After the end of the first half, Vasco head coach Antonio Lopes and Sport physical coach Eduardo Baptista had an argument and were both dismissed from the match by referee Antonio Hora Filho.
8996	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	In the second half, Sport came with a bolder attitude, but Vasco kept the game under control.
8997	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	After getting rid of three Sport's defenders, Pablo scored his first goal in Vasco's first team.
8998	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	Sport's team became more nervous and started making mistakes as 22 minutes after interval Jean received a pass from Wagner Diniz, and scored for Vasco.
8999	XIN_ENG_20080711.0216.LDC2009T13	The fourth and last goal from Rio's team was scored by captain Edmundo, in the 25th minute.

9001	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's key exports tumbled 17.5 percent in November from a year ago as shipments to the recession-hit United States and Europe fell, the government said Wednesday.
9002	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Last month's drop in non-oil domestic exports (NODX) was worse than the 15.4 percent fall posted in October, and marked the seventh month they have fallen in the city-state's trade-oriented economy, which is already in recession.
9003	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	It was also worse than the average 15 percent slide tipped by analysts in a Dow Jones Newswires poll.
9004	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	NODX was worth 12.06 billion Singapore dollars (7.83 billion US) last month.
9005	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	On a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, key exports declined 2.8 percent in November, said International Enterprise Singapore, the trade promotion agency.
9008	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Both destinations are major markets for Singapore.
9009	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Overall NODX shipments to Singapore's 10 biggest markets, including the United States and Europe, declined in November, it said.
9011	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's official growth forecast for 2008 has been slashed to about 2.5 percent, but Minister for Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang said the target looks unattainable.
9013	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We are looking at a very difficult trade environment... So I am afraid the economy will come in lower than what we expected," he said.
9014	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore's economy, valued at 243 billion dollars in 2007, is heavily dependent on external demand which makes it vulnerable to any slip-ups in the global economy.
9017	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We know for a fact the orders from the US and other developed countries have been bad so it's a matter of time before it starts to affect the trade figures for Asia," said Tan.
9018	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	"We haven't been able to turn the corner on this financial crisis... I would expect the NODX figures to continue to deteriorate," he said.
9019	AFP_ENG_20081217.0588.LDC2009T13	Singapore was the first Asian economy to sink into a recession after two straight quarters of economic contraction, government figures released in October showed.

9023	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Arthur Blank was flying home from a Kenyan safari on his private plane, scheduled to land in England to refuel, when the pilot left the cockpit, a sheaf of paper in his hand.
9024	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"You need to see this," the pilot said.
9025	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
9026	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The date was July 17, 2007.
9027	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The football team on which Blank had lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as completely as any football team ever has.
9028	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season that never ended.
9032	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	This fire, alas, had a wickedly long tail.
9033	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Within five months, Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the quarterback's singular skills.
9035	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
9036	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
9037	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"Clearly the answer we felt was, 'Yes.'
9039	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
9040	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
9041	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.
9042	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6?
9044	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It's possible, but to be frank, the issues Bobby had with the players and communication started from the very beginning.
9045	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The players from the get-go felt disconnected.
9046	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We would have had to win a lot of games for (pacification) to take place."
9048	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Receiving the indictment?
9049	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Seeing training camp begin with Vick in court in Richmond, Va., and PETA protestors outside the gates at Flowery Branch?

9051	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Having Petrino bolt the day after Vick was sentenced to 23 months in jail?
9053	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"A lot had been speculation up to then.
9054	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... Even after the indictment, Michael was still saying, 'I'm innocent
9056	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The reality was that what Michael had been saying was not true.
9057	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was difficult when Bobby left, but I didn't have a six-year relationship with him."
9058	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom Brady)?
9059	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What about Indianapolis (with Peyton Manning)?
9060	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	With Michael, as spectacular as he was - not always great - with that kind of exciting player, he becomes in many ways the face of the franchise."

9073	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	QUEENSBURY, New York 2007-03-26 15:59:05 UTC
9074	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	A cruise line and the captain of a boat that capsized on a New York state lake, killing 20 elderly tourists, pleaded guilty Monday to a misdemeanor charge.
9075	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Shoreline Cruises and Capt. Richard Paris pleaded guilty to not having enough crew members aboard the Ethan Allen tour boat when it overturned during a fall foliage cruise on Oct. 2, 2005, throwing its passengers into the cold water of the Adirondack Mountain lake.
9077	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Paris also agreed to serve more than 200 hours of community service in lieu of 15 days in jail.
9078	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Paris was the only crew member aboard
9080	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	District Attorney Kate Hogan had said a more serious charge of criminal negligence was not supportable because there was not enough evidence to show the operators knew the boat would capsize.
9083	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	James Quirk, Shoreline Cruises' owner, declined to comment.
9084	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	At least nine civil lawsuits are pending over the drownings.
9086	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	A grand jury heard conflicting testimony from survivors -- some said there was no wake, others said it was 6 to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters).
9088	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The Ethan Allen was certified to carry 48 passengers plus two crew, according to weight limits that have since been modified.
9089	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	There were 48 people on the boat -- including Paris -- when it capsized, but federal investigators said the boat should not have been certified to carry that many people.
9090	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The boat's passenger capacity was calculated when it was manufactured in 1966, but modifications over the years made it less stable and its capacity should have been slashed to 14 people, the NTSB reported.

9095	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's so cute.
9096	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	I just love it," she said.
9097	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	To make sure women like Sasao get the message, Nissan Motor Co. launched a merchandise line for Pino, including pink bear-shaped cushions, seat covers with hearts, a CD case that looks like fat red lips, and a colorful cover for a tissue box.
9098	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ironically, Pino isn't even made by Nissan, Japan's third biggest automaker.
9099	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	It's made by Suzuki Motor Inc.
9100	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But under a manufacturing agreement, Nissan packages Suzuki's Alto model differently, with fancier seat fabric, a distinct front design and a hubcap inspired by a snowflake so the wheels appear to sparkle on the road -- all touches to give the car that cute look.
9101	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan had 5,500 orders for the Pino in the first month since it went on sale in January, more than double the company target of 2,500 a month.
9102	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Sasao knew the Alto looked a lot like her Pino and was quite a bit cheaper.
9103	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The Pino starts at about 1 million yen (US$8,600
9104	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro6,500), while the Alto starts at 650,000 yen (US$5,600
9105	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro4,200).
9107	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	While models such as sportscars or family minivans target segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they usually don't sell in numbers.
9108	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Toyota Motor Corp. officials often say they don't believe in overly specific marketing tactics, which are apt to backfire for an automaker known for best-sellers like the Camry and Corolla.
9111	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Also, Japanese consumers frequently use personal products to show off who they are, often buying designer-brand products to make a statement, said Kazuo Ikegami, marketing expert and professor at Rissho University.
9116	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The TV ads also tell a similar story.
9118	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities -- exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.
9119	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"Rather than talk about the features of a minicar, we thought it's better to talk about how cute it is," she said.

9127	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua)
9128	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	An official at the Nepali Home Ministry on Saturday said it would be difficult for the Nepali government to hold the elections to constituent assembly (CA) at the same time across the country, the local media house's website ekantipur.com reported Saturday.
9129	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Secretary of the Home Ministry Umesh Mainali said the task of holding CA polls across the country at the same time would be difficult because of the insufficient number of police personnel, including Armed Police Force (APF) at the government's disposal.
9130	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a program held in Dolakha, some 50 km east of Kathmandu, Mainali said, "With the Election Commission's (EC) repeated refusal to hold the elections, it will be very difficult for some 55,000 police and 23,000 APF to provide security at all polling booths."
9131	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Stating that it was impossible to assign three-four police personnel per polling station, Home Secretary Mainali said that it was necessary to set up temporary security outfits for the election.

9134	AFP_ENG_20070823.0195.LDC2009T13	Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski on Thursday called on the international community to consult his country about the future status of Kosovo.
9135	AFP_ENG_20070823.0195.LDC2009T13	"Macedonia will launch an initiative to the US, EU and Russia to organise a meeting with representatives of this region including Macedonia," Crvenkovski said after a meeting of Macedonia's security council dedicated to Kosovo.
9136	AFP_ENG_20070823.0195.LDC2009T13	He stressed, however, that "at this moment, there are no indications of any serious threats to the security of Macedonia."

9147	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2008-02-12 06:19:05 UTC
9148	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	Israel's housing minister said Tuesday that bids would go out soon to build 1,100 apartments in east Jerusalem -- a move sure to anger Palestinians, who claim the city's eastern sector as capital of a future state.
9149	APW_ENG_20080212.0279.LDC2009T13	Housing Minister Zeev Boim told Israel Radio that bids would go out soon to build 350 apartments in the Har Homa neighborhood and an additional 750 in Pisgat Zeev.

9190	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Israel's Labor Party chooses new leader to challenge Sharon's Likud Party in January
9195	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	While surveys had indicated Mitzna would win the primary, polls also point to Sharon's hawkish Likud party winning the largest number of seats in Jan. 28 general elections, benefitting from the Israeli public's shift to the right after two years of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
9196	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said Tuesday that if elected prime minister, he would reverse Sharon's course by withdrawing unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and negotiating with any Palestinian leadership. ''
9197	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The Labor Party is embarking on a new path to present the Israeli public a real alternative,'' he said at his headquarters after initial results were announced.
9198	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Addressing supporters at Labor Party headquarters in Tel Aviv early Wednesday, Ben-Eliezer conceded defeat but said he would keep his supporters together, hinting that he would continue to challenge Mitzna's supremacy from inside the party.
9199	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	He said Mitzna called him, and Ben-Eliezer pledged the Mitzna his support in the election campaign.
9201	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	During his 20-month tenure, Ben-Eliezer oversaw military strikes against Palestinian militants, and when he resigned last month, soldiers were reoccupying many Palestinian towns.
9202	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``The voters are saying we want a different leadership and (Ben- Eliezer) lost because he has been a party of the leadership for the past 20 months,'' said political commentator Akiva Eldar.
9203	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Nabil Abu Rdeneh, an aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said the election was an internal Israeli matter. ''
9205	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ronnie Milo, a former Likud Cabinet minister, said the outcome would only help Likud in January since the dovish Mitzna would alienate centrist voters.
9206	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``I think the outcome is excellent for the Likud,'' he said.
9207	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Weizman Shiri, a Ben-Eliezer backer, confronted leading party dove Yossi Beilin on television, accusing Beilin, a key Mitzna backer, of destroying the party by moving it to the left.
9209	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The actual vote was expected to be trickle into party headquarters in Tel Aviv in the course of the evening.
9210	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Sharon called an early election at the beginning of the month after Labor left the government in a fight over funding for Jewish settlements.
9211	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Sharon is currently battling Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for Likud leadership, which will be decided in a primary next week.
9212	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	In 1996, 1999 and 2001 Israel held direct elections for prime minister _ but that system has now reverted to the past parliamentary one in which the prime minister is the party leader able to muster a majority in the 120-member Knesset.
9213	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Likud leads the hawkish bloc of parties, and Labor the dovish one.
9215	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``There's no reason in the world for us to be in the Gaza Strip,'' he said in an interview Tuesday morning as he toured party branches in the Tel Aviv area.
9216	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``We will put our forces around Gaza, around the fence, protecting Israel.''
9217	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said a Gaza withdrawal wouldn't depend on negotiations with the Palestinians, but that he also intended to resume talks without conditions.
9218	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Peace talks collapsed nearly two years ago, and Sharon has refused to resume negotiations without a cessation of violence and has sought to marginalize Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
9219	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The bearded Mitzna said that if he became convinced that no agreement with the Palestinians was possible, he would pull out unilaterally from parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
9220	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Jewish settlements in areas evacuated by Israel would be uprooted.
9221	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians were looking for a Labor leader, and an Israeli government, that followed in the footsteps of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist Israeli Jew who opposed Rabin's peace efforts and the negotiations with Arafat.
9224	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna acknowledged he might lose in January, but said his election as party leader would give Labor a stronger showing in parliament that would allow it to be a ``fighting opposition'' if it didn't win office.
9225	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ben-Eliezer had said his appeal among more hawkish voters made him the better challenger to Likud since Mitzna would ``take us further to the left and keep us as the opposition for a long time.''
9226	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ramon told voters to cast their ballot for the person who will ``present a real alternative of hope to Sharon's government of failure.''
9227	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said he wouldn't join a new unity government under the same formula that Labor joined Likud in the past, but said he would consider a coalition if Likud accepts his positions on disengaging from the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling settlements.
9228	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``If we can make unity around separation from the Palestinians, OK.

9246	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don and Alleen Nilsen take humor seriously.
9247	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
9249	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take the show The Simpsons.
9250	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
9251	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Their research may seem light- hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to studying science and technology.
9252	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
9253	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Using humor can give you power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships.
9256	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Tell the wrong joke and you alienate people and become a jerk.
9257	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	(More on that later, including how to keep out of trouble.)
9258	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Forty years ago, Don Nilsen began using written jokes in his English classes to make grammar lessons more interesting.
9260	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
9263	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
9264	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.
9265	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Instead of toiling in a lab, the Nilsens watch television sitcoms and rent DVD comedies.
9266	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are voracious readers of anything funny.
9267	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can jot down anything funny that he reads or hears.
9269	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting.
9270	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
9271	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't stop him from trying.
9272	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and setting up the joke.
9273	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	I get it set up really well, and then I think, 'What was it about?'
9274	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	My students love to see me get caught this way."
9276	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's more challenging with some people," said Alleen Nilsen, citing former Vice President Al Gore as an example.
9277	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of humor.
9278	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
9279	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use," Alleen Nilsen said.
9280	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor is much broader.
9286	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes have common threads.
9287	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
9288	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
9289	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Penicillin."
9290	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean an ultimate dream.
9292	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Just as humor has common threads, humor gone awry can mean trouble.
9293	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
9294	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
9295	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.
9296	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
9297	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
9298	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
9299	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Alleen Nilsen used to keep notes about humor that cropped up in university meetings.
9300	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
9303	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."
9305	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Someone else adds a funny thought.

9309	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."

9403	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	A Macedonian court sentenced two people to 14 and a half years in prison each on Friday after finding them guilty of trafficking almost half a tonne of cocaine.
9404	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	"The defendants are guilty of the trafficking, production and illicit trade of drugs," Court of Skopje judge Vesna Dimiskovska said as she read out the verdict.
9405	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	A woman, Stanislava Cocorovska-Poletan, had been found to have unlawfully organised the drug's transportation, while Alija Azirovic was the driver of the truck in which the huge stash was found in January.
9406	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	Lawyers acting for the pair said they would appeal the decision.
9407	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	Police seized the cocaine from a truck owned by Cocorovska- Poletan's company after it had entered Macedonia from the neighbouring Serbian province of Kosovo.
9408	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	The value of the drug haul, the biggest intercepted by Macedonian authorities yet and believed to have come from Venezuela, was estimated at about 40 million euros (54 million dollars).
9409	AFP_ENG_20071130.0263.LDC2009T13	According to the indictment, it had come via Italy, Montenegro and Kosovo and was intended for the Greek market.

9424	AFP_ENG_20080425.0363.LDC2009T13	Maybe not everything has worked out, but this makes your trip more valuable," Putin told the Council of Europe's human rights commissioner, Thomas Hammarberg, at the Kremlin.
9425	AFP_ENG_20080425.0363.LDC2009T13	Hammarberg was at the end of a week-long visit that took in Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia in the troubled North Caucasus region, where Russian forces are accused of massive human rights violations in their long-running conflict with local guerrillas.
9426	AFP_ENG_20080425.0363.LDC2009T13	The Council of Europe has frequently censured Russia for its conduct.

9432	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	"The NAACP is sad to announce the resignation of CEO Bruce Gordon," the Baltimore, Maryland based group said in a press release.
9433	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond went on in the statement to "wish Mr. Gordon well in his future pursuits."
9434	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	Gordon, a former senior executive at Verizon, is credited with reversing a precipitous membership slide in the African-American rights group, which counts some 300,000 members in its ranks, but as recently as a decade ago boasted about a half-million.
9435	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	No official reason was given for Gordon's departure, but US media reported that he clashed repeatedly with board members over charting a new direction for the group, management style and other matters.
9436	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	NAACP officials said the group's general counsel, Dennis Hayes, has been named interim president, and that the search for Gordon's successor would begin without delay.
9437	AFP_ENG_20070305.0370.LDC2009T13	"We will immediately begin a widespread search for a replacement, examining candidates from the non-profit, corporate, and civil rights communities and others, seeking a new president who can insure our mission of social justice advocacy strengthens and grows as we approach our centennial anniversary in 2009," Bond said.

9440	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	A twice-convicted killer with a history of violence that continued even after he was sent to death row was executed Tuesday for gunning down two video store workers during a robbery 14 years ago in Dallas.
9441	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I love all y'all.
9442	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I forgive all y'all.
9443	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	See y'all when you get there," Leon David Dorsey IV said in his final statement.
9444	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"Do what you're going to do."
9445	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey, 32, acknowledged his sister when witnesses filed in but didn't direct any comments to the relatives of his victims.
9446	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was pronounced dead nine minutes after the lethal drugs began to flow.
9447	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey was the seventh prisoner executed this year in America's most active death penalty state and the first of two inmates scheduled to die this week.
9448	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Two more are to die next week.
9450	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Prison records showed that since Dorsey arrived on death row eight years ago, he's had at least 95 disciplinary cases, including a 2004 attack where he used an home-made knife to stab an officer 14 times in the back.
9451	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	The officer's body armor prevented serious injuries.
9452	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks ago, authorities recovered another shank from his cell.
9453	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	His threats of violence kept prison officials from making him available for media interviews as his execution date approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome inmates.
9454	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	But prison officials said he offered no resistance as he was led to the death chamber.
9455	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said, calling him a "true psychopath."
9456	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery, when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video store in East Dallas where they worked.
9457	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after midnight to steal $392 from a cash register.
9458	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He shot the workers when Armstrong had difficulty opening a safe at gunpoint and Lindsey tried to run.
9459	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Most of the crime was recorded on security cameras in the store.
9460	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been the gunman.
9461	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Five months after the video store killings, Dorsey killed a 51 -year-old Korean woman, Hyon Suk Chon, at the convenience store she managed in Ennis, south of Dallas.
9462	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was in prison for that slaying when he was questioned again about the double slaying and confessed.
9463	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview from prison while he was awaiting trial.
9464	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I've done cut folks
9465	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've done stabbed folks
9466	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've killed folks," he told The Dallas Morning News.
9467	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"But it don't bother me."
9468	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey at age 12 moved to Waxahachie to live with his grandparents after he was booted from Germany where his mother was stationed in the Air Force.
9469	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Records show when he was 14 he took a gun to school and fired it.
9470	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	At 16, he fired at a couple driving in a car.
9471	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He'd walk down the street with a sawed-off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open -- just to see the reaction of people," Shook said.
9472	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's a piece of work."

9476	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	On a positive note, the Dodgers won't have to experience a home opener the rest of the season.
9477	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may not spare them outfielders being eaten up by the expanded, all-color advertising/scoreboard walls, or pitchers limping off the field because they didn't down enough sports drink, but at least they won't have to suffer any more ignoble openers.
9478	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kids skipped school for this.

9485	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Hey, but it was sunny and reasonably warm and the new parking scheme didn't turn into Chavez Ravine road rage and they still served Dodger Dogs.

9487	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers never led this one, and the game was pretty much devoid of dramatics.
9488	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	They almost seemed to treat the opener as this little requirement that had to be dealt with before moving on to other things, like the other 80 home games.

9494	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp has been off to a solid start, but in the fourth inning he chased a drive by Jeff Baker to the wall in right.
9495	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The drive hit the wall at about the same time as Kemp.
9496	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	This is a new wall, one that oddly doubles as a scoreboard, or streamlined video board.
9497	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The video board is about double the size of last season's out-of- town scoreboard.
9499	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's covered in plexiglass, which supposedly gives, but apparently not too much.
9500	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit an area that would have been padded last year -- the padding added years ago after Darryl Strawberry separated his shoulder crashing into the wall.
9501	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I got hops like Jordan, I jumped so high," Kemp said.
9502	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit the video wall with his right shoulder and fell in a clump.
9503	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Pain flashed through his shoulder and he feared serious injury.
9504	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"At first I thought it was worse than it was," he said.
9505	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp left the game and was taken to a local hospital for X-rays.
9506	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Seasons had gotten off to better starts.
9507	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	New Dodgers trainer, and former Giants trainer, Stan "No Relation" Conte said X-rays were negative, revealing no fractures or apparent dislocation, but more would be known today.
9508	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers veteran second baseman Jeff Kent remained understandably skeptical about the logic of a video-board outfield wall.
9509	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about that," Kent said.
9511	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may have to go.
9512	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't think guys are going to want to climb that."
9513	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Then in the top of the fifth, Nomar Garciaparra bobbled a Kazuo Matsui grounder for an error.
9514	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, covering first, immediately grabbed the back of his right hamstring after hitting the bag.
9515	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodger hearts dropped.
9516	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, the Dodgers' $47 million offseason acquisition, also left the game, though Conte later said the right-hander was simply dehydrated and cramped.
9517	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is expected to make his next start.
9518	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"He'll be fine," Little said.
9520	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	He gave up a first-inning home run to Garrett Atkins, but then provided the Dodgers with their only power of the day, hitting a solo shot off Jeff Francis in the third.
9521	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It was that kind of goofy, not-quite-together opener.
9522	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Things got off to a less than auspicious start when the two F-16s from Edwards Air Force Base that were supposed to fly over as the climax of the opening ceremony flew over Dodger Stadium before the anthem was even sung.
9523	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers took the field with Wilson Valdez at shortstop for the injured Rafael Furcal and Ramon Martinez at third for Wilson Betemit.
9524	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Betemit is healthy but erratic, and that Dodgers commitment to him at third lasted a whole five games.
9525	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There were several small moments to make the Dodger faithful nervous -- Juan Pierre unable to throw a runner out at the plate on a ball so shallow Kent almost could have gotten there

9537	APW_ENG_20070406.0552.LDC2009T13	The two boats collided around the windmarker of Wednesday's third fleet race, also causing United Internet Team Germany to lose a rig.

9547	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude oil imports from Africa topped supplies from the Middle East in 2006 for the first time in 21 years, recent government data show.
9548	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent, or 1.3 million barrels a day.
9549	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Now, the fractional edge given to African crude oil suppliers underscores a number of market changes and may grow wider in coming years.
9550	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Surging growth from Asia -- led by China, where oil demand is expected to grow 6.2 percent this year -- is drawing huge volumes of Middle East crude.
9551	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. market, output constraints from aging oil fields in Mexico and Venezuela are weighing on imports from those countries.
9552	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude supplies from Africa and the Middle East each accounted for a 22 percent share of U.S. crude imports, but in actual physical supplies, Africa's flow topped the Middle East by 8,000 barrels a day.
9554	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The 22 percent share -- the biggest in 25 years -- compares with 21 percent last year and a share of less than 13 percent in 2002.
9555	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The volume of U.S. crude imports from the Middle East, at 2.22 million barrels a day, dipped just 20,000 barrels a day on the year, but marks the third straight annual decline.
9557	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	"Strong demand growth in Asia is pulling Persian Gulf crude eastward and the new supply from Africa is staying in the Atlantic Basin," said Greg Priddy, global energy analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington, D.C.
9558	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Major producers such as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil exporter -- and other Middle East producers have targeted more volumes to China and India, where they've also built joint ventures to sell petroleum products.
9559	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia saw its third straight decline in crude supply to the U.S. market, with a 1.7 percent dip to 1.42 million barrels a day, the lowest volume since 1999.
9561	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from output-constrained Caracas slumped 8.2 percent.
9563	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Oil producers in Africa have picked up the slack.
9564	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from Angola surged 41 percent in December from a year earlier, capping a 12.5 percent full-year gain to a record average of 513,000 barrels a day.
9565	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude imports from Algeria jumped 57 percent to 357,000 barrels a day in 2006, the highest volume since 1980.
9567	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	However, U.S. imports from Nigeria -- Africa's biggest oil producer -- dropped 3.2 percent on the year to 1.043 million barrels a day, the lowest level since 2003 as civil unrest in the oil-producing Delta region disrupted supplies throughout the year.
9569	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	In 2006, Canada supplied 1.782 million barrels a day to the United States, the most ever from a single source and a 9.1 percent jump from a year ago.

9574	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed a man in northern Vietnam in the country's second death from the illness this year, and health officials warned Thursday that the virus could spread further.
9575	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The 40-year-old man from Hai Duong province died Wednesday, six days after being admitted to the national tropical disease hospital in the capital, Hanoi, said Nguyen Huy Nga, director of the Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine Department.
9576	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The man's test results came back positive Sunday for the dangerous H5N1 virus strain.
9577	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	He was the 49th person to die of the virus in Vietnam since bird flu began raging across Asia in late 2003.
9578	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	H5N1 killed a 32-year-old man in northern Tuyen Quang province in January.
9579	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Nga said the latest victim developed flu symptoms on Feb. 2 and was admitted to the Hanoi hospital Feb. 10.

9594	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	And then he settles into a calmer, more contemplative groove as the film progresses.
9595	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	Of course this is somewhat unavoidable since he spends the balance of movie traveling through the Middle East.
9596	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	The sobering side of life is hard to ignore when you're wearing a bulletproof vest in Afghanistan.

9600	NYT_ENG_20080417.0200.LDC2009T13	This eventually leads to him doing things like walking through a Middle-Eastern mall asking people if they've seen Osama, and standing outside a cave in Afghanistan, yelling in, "Yoo-hoo!

9673	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
9674	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
9675	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He said that police have captured the primary suspects who allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on March 14 in Lhasa.
9676	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	"The suspects are closely connected with the Dalai clique," he said.
9677	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique, Wu revealed.

9680	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	A Christian activist was detained Sunday while bicycling to a church service in the Chinese capital attended by U.S. President George W. Bush, who emerged later extolling religious freedoms before continuing with his Olympics visit.
9681	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Also Sunday, five Tibet activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, were taken away by security agents after protesting near Tiananmen Square, the latest in a series of small, short-lived attempts by demonstrators to use the games to showcase their causes.
9682	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hours before, Hua Huilin said he and his brother, Hua Huiqi, a housing activist and member of Beijing's underground Christian church, were stopped by two black cars while bicycling to Kuan Jie Protestant Church around dawn.
9683	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huilin said they were taken away in separate cars by security agents, whom his brother recognized from previous encounters.
9685	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	He was released in the afternoon but Hua Huiqi was still at an undisclosed location, he said.
9686	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"I told him not to go because it's during the Olympic Games and this period is sensitive," Hua Huilin told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
9688	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	So I went with him hoping to protect him."
9689	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The line was disconnected three times during Hua's conversation, a sign that authorities were monitoring the telephone.
9690	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huiqi had been planning for days to be at the church at the same time as Bush, but it was not immediately clear what he was going to do.
9691	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	A man who answered the telephone at the Beijing Public Security Bureau's spokesman's office said they would try to find out what happened.
9692	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	He would not comment otherwise or give his name, as is common with Chinese officials.
9693	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	China allows worship only in officially approved churches such as the one Bush visited Sunday with first lady Laura Bush, so millions of people pray privately in house churches to avoid detection.
9694	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	After attending the service, Bush gathered for photos with parishioners on the front steps.
9695	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"It just goes to show that God is universal," Bush said.
9698	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	In the Tibet protest, Padma-Dolma Fielitz, a 21-year-old Tibetan, and another activist held the Himalayan region's national flag aloft just outside the south entrance of Tiananmen Square, according to a statement by Students for a Free Tibet.
9700	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Shortly after, three other activists tried to unveil a banner that said "Tibetans are dying for freedom" but were stopped by authorities, the group said.
9701	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	All five protesters -- including two Americans and two Canadians -- belong to the New York-based group.
9702	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Later Sunday, John Hocevar, a member of the activist group who videotaped the protest, told AP Television News that Chinese officials had escorted the group onto a plane bound for the United States.
9703	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Many Tibetans insist their region was an independent nation before Chinese Communist troops invaded in 1950, while Beijing says it has been part of its territory for centuries.
9704	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Pro-Tibet activists say China is using the Olympics to legitimize its rule in Tibet.
9705	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The demonstration lasted about five minutes and all five were led away, the group said.
9706	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	It was the latest in string of similar protests in the past week as Beijing became a focus of international attention because of the games, which opened Friday.
9707	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Chinese authorities often round up activists before and during sensitive periods, taking them to detention centers and other faraway locations.
9708	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	They have already further tightened normally stringent restrictions to curb potential criticism or protests during the Olympics.
9709	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, a human rights group said an activist whose husband was jailed earlier this year has disappeared and may have been taken by police to prevent her from speaking to journalists during the games.
9710	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said Zeng Jinyan disappeared on Thursday and has not been heard from since.
9711	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Zeng is married to activist Hu Jia, who was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison in April for "inciting state subversion."
9712	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The Communist government routinely uses the vague charge to imprison dissidents for years.
9713	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huiqi, an underground pastor who has fought against a development project in his neighborhood, has been arrested and beaten several times over the last few years because of his religious activities and has served six months in jail for "obstructing official business."

9716	XIN_ENG_20060909.0025.LDC2007T07	KABUL, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) - Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai on Saturday called on Afghans to adopt a policy of self- sufficiency and stand on their feet.
9717	XIN_ENG_20060909.0025.LDC2007T07	"This is our obligation to follow the way of our martyrs, defend our freedom, rebuild country and stand on our feet," he told thousands of audience gathered to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Afghanistan's national hero, the late resistance leader Ahmad Shah Masoud.
9718	XIN_ENG_20060909.0025.LDC2007T07	Masoud and millions of Afghans, Karzai added, had sacrificed their lives for the independence of Afghanistan and so, it is for the people of this war-ravaged country to reconstruct and safeguard it.
9719	XIN_ENG_20060909.0025.LDC2007T07	"I pray for the success of Afghanistan and call on all Afghans to get united and take the country towards progress and prosperity, " Karzai noted.
9720	XIN_ENG_20060909.0025.LDC2007T07	Other Afghan officials, including advisor to President Mohammad Qasim Fahim and former President Burhanudin Rabbani, paid tribute to late Masoud in their speeches.

9734	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The idea makes his neighbors nervous.
9735	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Like two-thirds of Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of East Montpelier depend on wells.
9740	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in the company of a growing number of states, the legislature adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust.
9741	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Beginning in 2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
9742	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter than Vermont this summer).
9743	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In recent years, eastern aquifers have been drawn down in areas around Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as Atlanta.
9744	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in northern Vermont, last summer during a drought.
9745	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Water is the resource of the 21st century," said Laurence R. Becker, Vermont's state geologist.
9746	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The amount of water that we use will increase and we will be looking for fresh water in many places."
9747	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	With the growing recognition that groundwater is not limitless, more states and localities are looking for ways to protect it.
9748	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Hampshire are at the forefront of this trend, and Vermont is now making its move.
9749	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The concerns of East Montpelier residents are reflected in the Great Lakes Resources compact, a broad water-management agreement already approved by the U.S. Senate and by eight Midwestern states and two Canadian provinces.
9750	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed in an era of abundance," said Andy Buchsbaum,director of the Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation.
9751	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"They were not designed to address shortages."
9752	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Ginny Lyons, a Democratic state senator in Vermont, believes that, given the possibility of a future in which water supplies may be constrained, "We've been doing things in an irrational way.
9754	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	She and state Sen. Diane Snelling, a Republican, responding to groundwater debates from Williston, a suburb of Burlington, (where neighbors fought over well water) to the town of Danby (where local residents opposed a mining operation), this year succeeded, by a large margin, in winning adoption of the law declaring groundwater a commonly owned resource -- in legal parlance, a public trust.
9755	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
9756	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.
9757	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Though Vermont is a relative latecomer in adopting the public trust status for groundwater, Maude Barlow, a Canadian crusader against bottled water and the author of "Blue Covenant: The Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to Water," argues that its new law, more than most, anticipates the day when people's thirst for ground water outstrips supplies.
9758	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It's no longer an under-the-radar issue," said Jon Groveman, the general counsel of the Vermont Natural Resources Council.
9759	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected."
9760	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In the past decade, commercial and industrial users, including golf courses, mining operations and, most notably, water bottlers, have faced increasing local opposition in damp regions from Maine to Wisconsin.
9761	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Andrew W. MacLean, a lobbyist in Montpelier who represents industries affected by the legislation, said he believed the law duplicated existing requirements, but did not want to oppose it.
9762	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There was a recognition by people that something was going to pass," he said.
9763	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The desire by the business community was to play an active role and shape it as we were able."
9767	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Both distinctions are now breaking down.
9768	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."
9769	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Replenishment from rain or surface water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
9770	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Extraction of ground water tends to alter natural flow patterns and speeds, the report said.
9772	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Mapping a Vermont aquifer and measuring its contents is thus akin to tracing a Jackson Pollock painting -- there are numerous units, of irregular dimensions, to delineate.
9773	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	While some residents of East Montpelier worry that their wells may suffer if Antonovich's firm, Montpelier Springs Water Co., opens for business, Antonovich said that he has had the aquifer mapped and that there is more than enough water for all.
9774	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, he keeps cordial relations with those who oppose him, said Carolyn Shapiro, one of a group of Antonovich's neighbors who pushed for the moratorium.
9775	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the moratorium.
9776	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also typified the debate over the public-trust law.
9778	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
9780	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum said he believes that the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis, or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that the West is now," he said.
9781	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is no water and they're trying to apportion droplets.
9782	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	They're in the terrible position of trying to judge between needs that are all critical with not enough resources."
9783	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum added, "We have the chance to get ahead of it."

9801	APW_ENG_20070121.0531.LDC2009T13	"The moment the snowball of voluntary sanctions begins, the pressure on Iran will be immense," he added.

9816	XIN_ENG_20070917.0192.LDC2009T13	He also called on Egypt and Jordan, who are set to join the conference, not to take part in if a breakthrough, i.e. Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, was not certain.

9819	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	More than 300 terrorist attacks were prevented in Russia last year, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Tuesday.
9820	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev said the plans for the attacks were detected by the country's new anti-terrorist system.
9821	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	"We cannot guarantee that every terrorist attack in the country will be prevented, but the efficiency of the work to prevent them has significantly increased," FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying.
9823	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	"An integral state system for the struggle against terrorism has been created," he said.
9824	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	Speaking about the recent warning about possible terrorist acts in Russia, Patrushev said, "Even though this information has not got confirmation, we have succeeded in averting terrorist acts on which we had our own information."
9825	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	Russian security forces were put on alert in January after authorities received information from "foreign partners" pointing to a terrorist plot to attack the country's public transport system.
9826	XIN_ENG_20070313.0267.LDC2009T13	No such attacks occurred.

9828	CNA_ENG_20071030.0033.LDC2009T13	Taoyuan, Oct. 30 (CNA) 10/30/07 19:59:12 (By T.C. Jiang)
9829	CNA_ENG_20071030.0033.LDC2009T13	Six Chinese women have been apprehended Monday at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan for attempting to use fake Republic of China (ROC) passports to transit to the United States, local customs officials said Tuesday.
9831	CNA_ENG_20071030.0033.LDC2009T13	Customs officials stopped and questioned them after discovering that they were holding fake passports, the officials noted.
9834	CNA_ENG_20071030.0033.LDC2009T13	The young women said they followed instructions by picking up fake passports and boarding passes to the U.S., which were hidden within the Taoyuan airport, the officials said.
9835	CNA_ENG_20071030.0033.LDC2009T13	Taoyuan prosecutors are investigating the case, according to the officials.

9837	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 2008-05-21 11:58:07 UTC
9838	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Five Palestinians, including a 5-month-old baby girl, were wounded in an Israeli airstrike against militants.
9839	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The Israeli military said they hit militants who had just fired rockets into southern Israel.
9840	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The militant Hamas that controls Gaza said the wounded Wednesday were civilian bystanders.
9841	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Gaza militants launch rockets and mortars into Israel almost daily.
9842	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Two Israeli civilians were killed in recent attacks in the past two weeks, and 14 were wounded last week when a rocket hit a mall in the southern city of Ashkelon.
9843	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Israeli airstrikes aimed to stop the rocket attacks have killed 14 Palestinians during that time.
9845	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Hamas militants clash regularly with the Israeli military in Gaza and along its borders, and reject Israel's right to exist.
9846	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, Hamas said one of its members was killed on a "holy mission."
9847	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	The term is used when a Hamas militant dies, either when mishandling explosives or in a premature explosion intended for an attack against Israel.
9848	APW_ENG_20080521.0637.LDC2009T13	Despite the violence, Israeli defense officials estimated Tuesday that an Egyptian-brokered truce could take effect in the coming days.
9849	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	FED, STILL WARY ON INFLATION, LEAVES A KEY RATE UNCHANGED
9850	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
9851	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time.
9852	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
9853	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."
9857	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	For the past several years, Fed governors including Ben S. Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the "core" rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to 2 percent a year.
9859	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
9860	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Fed policymakers are in no rush to reduce interest rates.
9861	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
9862	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.
9863	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
9867	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Most of the younger detainees are held in a facility that the military calls the "House of Wisdom."
9868	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense bloggers.
9870	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	As a result of the increased U.S. troop presence in Iraq this year, the number of Iraqis in U.S. detention has swelled from about 10,000 last year to more than 25,000.
9872	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
9876	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"And then when he's assessed to no longer be a threat, I'm going to release the detainee being less likely to be a recidivist."
9878	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his goal is to keep those who are released from harming U.S. troops or anyone else.
9882	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he believes his approach is "compelling because it's how you win this war, not only the one in Iraq, but the one on a greater basis."
9886	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He described older juveniles -- the 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds -- as "harder nuts" and said that 50 to 60 of them have been removed from U.S. detention facilities and turned over to Iraqi authorities for trial.
9888	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his staff members include a specialist in Islamic youth programs and he has also put together "a positive program that has been proven in Islam to actually turn the kids around to sort of reject some of these other things."
9889	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone, who speaks Arabic and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have 30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors.
9891	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The new religious training, Stone said, helps U.S. forces pinpoint the hard-core extremists.
9895	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We were trying to figure out if they're messing with us.
9896	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... You're not talking about radicals going to choirboys."
9897	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	But he also added that they're succeeding in countering extremists in the facilities.
9898	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We're busting them down, we're making whole moderate compounds that didn't exist before."
9899	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone described a sort of religious insurgency that occurred at one detention facility on Sept. 2.
9901	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	It's never happened before.
9902	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Found them, identified them, threw them up against the fence and shaved their frickin' beards off of them.
9905	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Of those four, at least two appear to be active-duty military, but as of Tuesday evening none so had discussed Stone's presentation online.
9906	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other elements of Stone's program are being developed.
9907	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he has created a "transition-out barracks" where detainees being released discuss civics and human rights.
9909	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he also wants to provide jobs for released detainees.
9911	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If they don't have any income, they're going to go back" to the insurgency.
9912	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Staff writers Joshua Partlow in Baghdad, Karen DeYoung and Rachel Dry contributed to this report.
9914	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	More than 150,000 grieving Pakistanis thronged the tomb of slain former premier Benazir Bhutto on Saturday, mourning their beloved leader one year after her assassination.
9916	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Thick fog had stranded tens of thousands on the roads leading into the area early in the day, prompting authorities to delay the start of the proceedings, but began to lift after noon.
9917	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Bhutto, 54, was assassinated on December 27, 2007 in a gun and suicide attack at a campaign rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, just two months after returning to Pakistan from exile to vie for a third term in power.
9918	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Her shocking death threw the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic nation into chaos, sparking violence and leading to months of political turmoil that ended in September when her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, claimed the presidency.
9919	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"In the tradition of a true Bhutto, she faced certain death rather than abandon her principles or the people," Zardari said in a message to the nation to mark the anniversary.
9923	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Tariq Waseem, a 25-year-old student from southwestern Baluchistan province, walked about 400 kilometres (250 miles) over 10 days with about a dozen friends in order to be at Saturday's event.
9924	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	But unlike his friends, he walked barefoot.
9928	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Ceremonies are expected to culminate with special prayers at 5:20 pm (1220 GMT) -- about the time Bhutto was attacked.
9930	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"We do not rule out any threat and we have done all things possible to maintain peace," senior police official Khadim Hussain Rind told AFP.
9932	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Closed-circuit cameras have been installed, and mourners were required to pass through metal detectors.
9933	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Both Zardari and the United Nations said they hoped a UN investigation would soon be launched into Bhutto's killing.
9934	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Pakistani and US officials have pinned the blame on Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud, but he denies any involvement.
9935	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	One year on, Pakistan's reverence for Bhutto continues unabated -- all television networks ran wall-to-wall Bhutto coverage on Saturday and the government has issued a 10-rupee coin and stamps bearing her portrait.
9936	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of vendors did a brisk business selling Bhutto memorabilia -- posters, photographs and recordings of her speeches -- ahead of the ceremony.
9937	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	The government has declared Saturday a national holiday in Bhutto's honour, and events were scheduled nationwide.
9938	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Candlelight vigils were held late Friday in Rawalpindi and the southern port city of Karachi.

9944	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	Wang said at a work conference that Chinese procuratorates at all levels have investigated more than 5,840 cases of duty dereliction involving 6,664 government officials since August 2005, including 218 officials of county and division-level or above.
9945	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	But he did not disclose the number of government officials convicted of duty dereliction after being investigated.
9947	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	"The investigation has helped maintain market order, secure judicial justice and regulate use of government power," Wang said.
9948	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	He said that in 2007 the procuratorates will continue to focus on investigation of cases in which judicial justice is hampered and environment damaged due to official's dereliction of duty.
9949	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	China investigated and charged a number of government officials for dereliction of duty over the past few years.

9951	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Police on Tuesday identified an 18-year-old Bosnian immigrant as the gunman who killed five people in a Utah shopping mall before he was shot dead by police.
9952	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank said detectives were still struggling to find a motive behind Solejman Talovic's bloody assault on the historic Trolley Square complex on Monday.
9953	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Talovic, whose family arrived in the United States about three or four years ago, was killed after being cornered by an off-duty police officer celebrating Valentine's Day early with his wife when the teenager's killing spree began.
9954	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Burbank said Talovic had been armed with a shotgun and a pistol and was carrying several rounds of ammunition in a backpack and a waistband.
9955	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"This individual had one thing in mind.
9956	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	He was well prepared, he had a backpack with numerous rounds of ammunition as well as an additional firearm," Burbank said.
9957	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"He had one purpose."
9958	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Burbank said the quick thinking of off-duty police officer Ken Hammond from Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had cut short Talovic's rampage, saving "numerous" lives.
9959	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Hammond had been having a Valentine's dinner with his wife and left the restaurant where they were eating after hearing gunfire.
9960	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"The officer contained him until other officers arrived and resolved the situation," Burbank said.
9962	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Hammond played down descriptions of himself as a hero.
9963	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	"I was just the one that was there," he told a news conference.
9964	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	No further details on Talovic were immediately available.
9965	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian community in Salt Lake City is reported to number around 3,000 people.
9967	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Police said a 52-year-old man, two 28-year-old women, a 24-year- old man and a 15 -year-old girl were killed in the attack, which took place at around 6:45 pm Monday.
9968	AFP_ENG_20070213.0801.LDC2009T13	Witnesses reported Talovic coolly moving through the 80-shop mall, gunning down his victims.

10060	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Gymnastics judges would no longer answer to officials in their own countries under the latest effort to remove politics from the sport.
10061	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	International Gymnastics Federation president Bruno Grandi said Monday he wants to establish a pool of judges who would have no ties or allegiances to their national federations.
10062	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The pool could be in place by 2010 or 2011.
10063	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"It is the last war I have against everybody," Grandi, speaking mostly through an interpreter, said in a 90-minute interview after the federation's annual meeting in Orlando.
10064	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"If the people understand that it's only in the interest of gymnastics, in two or three years we solve another big problem."
10065	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation -- or FIG -- already uses a judges pool for rhythmic gymnastics.
10066	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi led the charge to revamp the sport's traditional 10-point scale to an open-ended scoring system, which is supposed to give a truer representation of routine's value.
10067	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The system has been in use since the beginning of 2006, and will get its biggest test at the Beijing Olympics next year.
10068	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The change came after a series of judging errors at the Athens Olympics, most notably the debacle involving all-around champion Paul Hamm.
10069	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Two days after the competition, FIG announced that South Korea's Yang Tae-young wrongly had 0.1 points deducted off the start value of his second-to-last routine, the parallel bars.
10070	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Yang finished third, 0.049 points behind Hamm.
10071	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi's suggestion that Hamm share his gold medal fueled protests by the South Koreans that forced the American to defend himself all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
10075	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	There also were problems with the men's high bar and vault competitions in Athens.
10076	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi also expressed concern that some don't fully understand the new points system, wrongly believing that more difficult routines are rewarded even if performed incorrectly.
10077	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"The big problem we're having lately is that we have to penalize very strongly execution mistakes or lack of artistry," he said.
10078	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"This is the big philosophy I want to get through.
10080	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	If not, the deductions should be so strong that it's worse to do the more difficult thing."
10081	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Execution penalties are already higher than under the old system -- eight-tenths of a point, compared to a half-point -- but Grandi said he'd like to see them doubled.
10082	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation has also held classes to make sure judges understand the new rules, and is using video replay so judges can review routines.
10083	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"I intend for the Olympic Games to make sure the judges will apply the rules correctly," Grandi said.

10087	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain focusing on Iowa despite polls
10089	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
10091	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Republicans acknowledge that McCain is behind, but say the race is closer than the polling indicates.
10093	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	A Des Moines Register poll conducted Sept. 8-10 showed Obama ahead, 52 percent to 40 percent, while a Big Ten Battleground Poll a few days later, conducted Sept. 14-17, found the rivals tied at 45 percent.
10094	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks.
10095	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He held a small-business round-table in Des Moines, following up on a Sept. 18 stop in Cedar Rapids with running mate Sarah Palin.
10097	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe Sen. Obama has the lead that one or two polls indicate he does," said veteran Republican strategist Eric Woolson.
10099	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Still, the last two presidential elections were decided by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point.
10100	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrat Al Gore won the state in 2000, and President George W. Bush won it during his re-election in 2004 -- and independent voters still outnumber those in each of the major parties.
10101	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
10102	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"They still have the time, they still have the money.
10103	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	It's too early for them to bail out of Iowa," he said, noting the fairly cheap cost of advertising here.
10104	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Veteran Republican strategist Bob Haus said all candidates should be nervous about the Nov. 4 election.
10106	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Six months ago we were talking about Iraq, two months ago we were talking about flooding and now we're talking about federalizing the financial system."
10107	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain used the roundtable discussion to issue his latest call for dealing with the U.S. financial crisis, saying he spoke earlier in the day with Bush and urged action.
10109	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Housing and mortgages are at the root of this crisis," McCain said.
10111	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain aides say Iowa has made the list of competitive states he is focusing on.
10112	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Iowa has seven electoral votes
10113	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	it takes 270 decided in state-by-state contests to win the presidency.
10121	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, said McCain's problem in Iowa has less to do with organization than where he is on the issues, such as a new farm bill and incentives for alternative fuels.

10132	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	The first reports of the outbreak of the intestinal virus known as enterovirus 71, or EV71, emerged on Monday, with local Chinese officials quoted as saying 19 children had died and nearly 800 had been infected in Anhui.
10134	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All those infected were reportedly below the age of six, with the majority of them just two years old.
10135	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All kindergartens in the city were closed on Tuesday, Xinhua said, as authorities scrambled to contain the virus nearly two months after the first signs of potential major problems.
10137	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	EV71, which causes hand, foot and mouth disease, is very contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or faeces of an infected person.

10148	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Another newspaper on Tuesday raised cover-up allegations, referring to a similar incident in the same city four years ago, when authorities sought to hide a scandal over low-quality milk powder that killed at least 12 babies.

10154	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Football: Win over Fiorentina puts Bayern on the brink
10155	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern Munich ignored their poor league form to secure a convincing 3-0 win over Fiorentina in Tuesday's Champions League match in Munich to take control of Group F.
10156	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	First-half goals by Germany striker Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger, as well as a strike by Brazilian Ze Roberto on 90 minutes made the win safe.
10157	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Despite a dramatic slump in recent weeks which has seen them crash to 11th in the Bundesliga, Bayern forgot their domestic league form to take another three points in the quest to add to their 2001 Champions League crown.
10159	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	With two wins and a draw under their belt in Group F, Bayern are now on the verge of making the first knock-out phase with seven points from Lyon second on five.
10160	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But the result leaves Fiorentina in a precarious position -- especially after Lyon's 5-3 win at Steaua Bucharest -- at third in the table.
10161	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern had a dream start when Luca Toni brushed off a rib injury to face his former club and flicked the ball into the path of Miroslav Klose who out-paced the defence to drill the ball into the corner after just four minutes.
10162	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Then Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger capitalised on a mistake in the defence on the edge of the area and smashed his shot past Fiorentina's French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey on 25 minutes to make it 2-0 at the break.
10163	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Having scored 31 league goals for La Viola in the 2005/06 season, Toni is still a firm favourite amongst Fiorentina fans despite playing for Bayern and received a warm response when he was replaced on 57 minutes.
10164	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	His replacement, Germany striker Lukas Podolski, was soon into the action and had a chance to score on 61 minutes when French midfielder Franck Ribery put him into space.
10165	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But Cesare Prandelli's team will leave Munich disappointed they did not finish their chances having had some 23 shots on goal, compared to Bayern's 15, but were constantly frustrated by Bayern's defence.
10166	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	And on the stroke of 90 minutes Bayern's Ze Roberto unleashed an unstoppable shot which gave Frey little chance and made sure the Italians return home empty handed.
10167	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But with three games left for both teams there is still all to play for in the return leg on November 5 when the two sides meet at Fiorentina's Artemio Franchi stadium.

10169	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:
10170	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Legislation is progressing in the Virginia General Assembly that would pull the state out of the No Child Left Behind law's oversight.
10171	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	No matter that the law has helped boost student learning and narrow the achievement gap, that schools are more accountable, and that students who go to failing schools now have options.
10172	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Not even the threatened loss of millions of dollars in federal education aid seems to worry lawmakers more intent on making political points than good public policy.
10174	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The legislation directs the state Board of Education to come up with a plan for withdrawal, with one version even setting a deadline of June 30, 2009.
10175	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Del.
10176	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	R. Steven Landes, R-Augusta, a sponsor of the House bill, said that he hopes to clarify it so that the legislature would have to act again to sign off on any withdrawal.
10177	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The bills are in conference, where one hopes that they will die as the legislature rushes to adjourn.
10179	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	They undoubtedly are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300 million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be tolerated.
10180	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the bills passed by overwhelming margins, a product of Republicans averse to f!

10239	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	LAS VEGAS
10240	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	When Russian troops rolled into South Ossetia on Friday, Sen. John McCain's response was immediate and tough.
10241	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Russia had crossed "an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia," and should "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces," said McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in a hastily arranged statement delivered on an airport tarmac.
10242	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, trod more carefully, which was characteristic of his approach to foreign affairs.
10243	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He did not directly blame Russia and instead offered a more measured response, focused on negotiations, which largely echoed the official comments of the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and even President Bush.
10244	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war," Obama said in a statement issued by his campaign.
10245	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Although the statement added that "Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected," it concluded that "all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in Georgia."
10247	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama might respond to a crisis with international implications.
10248	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The fighting, which began when Georgian forces tried to retake the capital of South Ossetia from insurgents in the pro-Russian region of the Caucasus, was developing into the worst clash since Russian troops invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s.
10249	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	McCain spoke to two crucial people on Friday before making his statement: President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, whom he has known since 1997, and Steven J. Hadley, the White House national security adviser.
10252	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	To prepare a statement, he then relied on his foreign policy staff, including Randy Scheunemann, his chief foreign policy aide, whose firm has lobbied for Georgia for the past four years.
10253	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Scheunemann, who has worked for McCain's campaign since early 2007, took a leave from his firm, Orion Strategies LLC, in March of this year.
10254	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of the statement.
10255	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He delivered it on the tarmac upon landing in Des Moines.
10256	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama's response came in several stages.
10261	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Aides said Obama was also briefed by Hadley on Friday and was kept informed on developments by his foreign policy advisers as he flew to Hawaii.
10262	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Wendy Morigi, Obama's national security spokeswoman, said that in recent days the campaign had spoken to experts including Sam Nunn, a former senator of Georgia and an influential Democratic voice on foreign policy
10263	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Michael A. McFaul, a Russia scholar at Stanford University who heads the campaign's foreign policy team on Russia and Eurasia
10265	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	and Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic representative of Indiana, who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center.
10266	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Both campaigns also used the crisis to engage in their now-daily political combat, which in this round focused on Scheunemann and his ties to Georgia.
10267	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for, and has a vested interest in, the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government," said Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, who added that the "appearance of a conflict of interest" was a consequence of McCain's close ties to lobbyists.
10268	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter, of the McCain campaign, dismissed the criticism.

10318	APW_ENG_20070201.1493.LDC2009T13	Relations between Caracas and Washington have been tense recently, with U.S. officials accusing Chavez -- a close ally of Cuban leader Fidel Castro -- of becoming increasingly authoritarian and Chavez accusing U.S. officials of scheming against his left-leaning government.

10343	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Wiesel, 78, was at the Argent Hotel on February 1 for an interfaith conference when he was confronted around 6:30 pm in an elevator by a man insisting that he wanted to interview the author, the report said.
10344	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	Wiesel said he would do the interview in the lobby of the Third Street hotel, but the man insisted on going to Wiesel's room, said the paper.
10345	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	The man then stopped the elevator at the sixth floor, dragged Wiesel out and tried to force him into a room on that floor, The Chronicle reported.
10346	AFP_ENG_20070210.0023.LDC2009T13	"That's when (Wiesel) started yelling," the paper quotes police Sergeant Neville Gittens as saying.

10444	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Juan Martin had a slight preference to play second," Mancini said.
10445	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"And the fact that David is first is good because he has more experience."

10448	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Argentina has a great team and they want to win and have a big celebration," Spain captain Emilio Sanchez Vicario said.
10450	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	Nalbandian has lost six of the nine times he has played Ferrer, while Del Potro has won two of the three against Lopez.

10483	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The French say the children had been orphaned by the conflict in the neighboring Sudanese region of Darfur, and that they had arranged for French families to care for them.
10485	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Gilbert Collard, another defense lawyer, said that the accused will argue, "they did not come here to do harm, but to apply the legal doctrine of saving lives at any price.

10487	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Collard insisted that the defense team had "all the evidence to show that it was not kidnapping but a desire to save children in a humanitarian context."
10488	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The aid workers, from a group called Zoe's Ark, have been on a hunger strike since earlier this month to draw attention to the case, saying they feel abandoned by the French government.

10491	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The parents of many of the children say that they were told their children would be going to school in Chad, and there was no mention of a trip to France.
10492	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Other children said they were lured away from their families with sweets.
10493	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	The aid workers also reportedly applied fake blood and bandages to the children, although none of them had been wounded, in preparation for a planned flight to France.

10498	APW_ENG_20071221.0604.LDC2009T13	Bockel said that while France was working extremely hard on behalf of its citizens, it was taking care not to create "concerns and misunderstandings related to the question of (Chad's) sovereignty, which could complicate matters."

10509	XIN_ENG_20080825.0251.LDC2009T13	As the main reason for the recent rebounding, some analysts attributed it to concerns on the further cooling relationship between Russia and western countries due to the South Ossetia conflict.

10517	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The deadline for Lebanese parliament to elect a new president is imminent on Friday, while uncertainty and doubt are running high as rival pro- and anti- Syrian politicians are still at odds on a compromise presidential candidate.
10518	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The parliament is scheduled to convene at 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) to pick a successor to replace pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud whose term ends at midnight.
10519	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The anti-Syrian ruling majority and pro-Syrian opposition have not strike a deal on a compromise candidate despite intensive international mediation, drawing speculations that Friday's session, which has been delayed for four times since September, might be postponed again.
10520	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Early in the morning, a crowd of journalists assembled outside the parliament building, waiting for parliamentarians to show up for the planned session.
10521	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	In downtown Beirut, usually bustling streets are quiet as the area where the parliament building is located was declared off- limits.
10522	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, vigilant soldiers, police and guards are heavily deployed along the street, with more armed vehicles and tanks at major intersections.
10523	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Under Lebanon's constitution, if no president is elected by the parliament in time limit, presidential powers pass to the government.
10524	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	But Lahoud has reiterated that he will not hand over the power to the government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora, which he considered as "illegitimate."
10525	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	According to the country's power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Maronite Christian and is elected by parliament rather than by popular votes.
10526	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	A two-thirds majority is required for a candidate to be elected by parliament in a first round of voting.
10527	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	In the event of a second round, a simple majority suffices.

10532	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Rafael Nadal extended his record run on clay to 69 straight wins as he moved a step closer to a title hat-trick at the Barcelona Open on Thursday.
10533	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	The Spanish top seed beat former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson 6-1, 6-4, but not without a spirited comeback from the Swede in a combative second set of the third-round contest.
10534	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal said he is under no pressure when he plays, but knows that his charmed life cannot go on forever.

10539	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	After riding roughshod over the number 73 Johansson in a 21-minute opener, Nadal looked like having things all his own way.
10540	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	But Johansson, 32, showed nerve as he re-discovered his survival instincts to turn the second into a struggle at the Real club.
10541	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Johansson fired six aces and held serve in a marathon sixth game featuring eight deuces.

10544	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	The Spaniard is bidding to collect a hat-trick of Barcelona titles, aiming to become the second man after Swede Mats Wilander (1982-1984) to win the event three times on the trot.

10567	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In the West, the name Tibet has long evoked unspoiled Himalayan landscapes, cinnamon-robed monks spinning prayer wheels and a peace-loving Dalai Lama seeking freedom for his repressed Buddhist followers.
10568	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Here in China, people have embraced a different view
10569	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	they regard Tibet as a historical part of the nation and see its sympathizers in the West as easily fooled romantics.
10570	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Thanks to government propaganda, but also to ethnic pride, most Chinese see the Dalai Lama and his monks as obscurantist reactionaries trying to split the country and reverse the economic and social progress that China has brought to a backward and isolated land over the past 58 years.
10571	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The violent protests by Buddhist monks and other Tibetans that exploded in Lhasa on Friday, therefore, have generated widespread condemnation among the country's majority Han Chinese.
10573	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Against that background, the Communist Party has met with broad popular approval in vowing to crack down on the rioters -- most of whose victims were Han Chinese -- and in qualifying the "impudent" Dalai Lama as a "master terror maker" who has hoodwinked the West with his appeals for peace.
10574	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	While the rest of the world invokes the Beijing Olympics and advises restraint, Chinese specialists and the public have urged the government to move decisively -- and gamble that the Olympics will not be spoiled.
10575	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The riot in Lhasa was caused by the Dalai Lama," said Zhang Yun, a professor at the government-sponsored Chinese Center for Tibetan Studies in Beijing.
10576	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks are very easily influenced by their religious leader, so they are irrational compared to other types of people," he added.
10578	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	There is a lot of prejudice against the Chinese government.
10579	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	People believe all that stuff about the Dalai Lama, and that the Chinese government is all wrong.
10581	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Jorge Chiang, a stylishly dressed Hong Kong businessman on a trip to Beijing, said he, too, believed the bloody rioting was set off on orders from the Dalai Lama.
10582	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Now, he predicted, the Chinese government will use the violence as a reason to round up the most prominent activist monks and "tighten its control over Tibet."
10583	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I believe the government is capable of resolving this situation," said a young woman walking in central Beijing on a brilliant spring afternoon.
10585	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	An Internet commentator who identified himself as Roomx said Buddhist monks have no more right than anybody else to torch shops and kill the Han Chinese businessmen inside.
10586	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"They are all Chinese citizens," he added.
10587	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks who are connected to this conduct have to be arrested.
10588	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, it is not in conformity with rule by law."
10589	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Dramatizing how broadly such views are held even among the computer-savvy young generation, similar outrage exploded on the Internet after the Icelandic pop singer Bjork capped a concert in Shanghai on March 2 by shouting "Tibet!
10590	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Tibet!"
10591	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	after a song about independence.
10592	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Censorship officials huffed about how her gesture was out of place and pledged to tighten controls over foreign performers in China.
10593	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Tibet Autonomous Region's local government issued an announcement after the riots saying the Dalai Lama and his followers instigated the violence "intending to break Tibet away from the motherland."
10594	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Their allegation reflected China's long- standing complaint that the Dalai Lama, though he preaches limited autonomy, in fact has not abandoned his campaign to make Tibet and its 2.8 million residents fully independent from China.
10595	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	For those with long memories in Beijing, that has always been the situation.
10596	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama, now 72, led a violent uprising with help from the Central Intelligence Agency after Chinese troops reimposed rule from Beijing in 1950.
10597	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The subversion campaign failed, and he was forced in 1959 to flee on horseback to India, where he has lived in exile for half a century.
10598	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	It was to mark the anniversary of his dramatic flight over the Himalayas that anti-China demonstrations in Lhasa got started last Monday.

10601	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	With the Dalai Lama as its leader, however, Tibet governed itself as an independent nation while China was torn by the upheavals of the first half of the 20th century.
10602	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	So for Beijing officials and the public they have educated through propaganda, the Dalai Lama is less a devout Buddhist than a secessionist rebel.
10603	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"Now the blaze and blood in Lhasa has unclad the nature of the Dalai Lama," said an editorial from the official New China News Agency.
10604	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"And it's time for the international community to recheck their stance toward the group under the camouflage of nonviolence, if they do not want to be willingly misled."
10605	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama's hold on people's imagination in the West has long irritated the Chinese government.
10606	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The New China News Agency editorial described his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in 1989, as "tainted" by Friday's rioting.
10607	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Congressional Gold Medal, which injected a chill into U.S.-China relations last October, turned out to be a "fig leaf" for the "rhetoric lama to sell his deceitful philosophy," it said.
10608	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In any case, the Chinese government has portrayed its presence in Tibet as beneficial for the population, citing the breakup of traditional serfdom in the countryside, improved health care and school construction.
10609	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	A Beijing-to-Lhasa train that began service in July 2006 was designed to further accelerate economic development, bringing in tourists and taking out minerals.
10610	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The economic development has been accompanied by an influx of Han Chinese who, Tibetan nationalists complain, have tightened their grip on all the economic and political levers.
10611	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Han Chinese who were killed in Friday's rioting, for instance, were identified as shop owners and employees singled out by Tibetans resentful of their economic domination.
10612	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Chinese arrivals, Tibetans and their supporters abroad say, have submerged Tibetan culture and Buddhist traditions by drawing the territory more closely into the rest of China.
10613	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Signs along the main street leading to Lhasa's celebrated Jokhang Temple, they note, are just as likely to be written in Chinese as Tibetan, and the saleswomen tend to speak Mandarin rather than the region's own tongue.
10614	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	A Chinese Tibet specialist in Beijing who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the tensions said the situation was inevitable as China pursues economic development of the region.
10615	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Like the American West in the 19th century, he said, modernization of China's West in the 21st century is bound to dilute the traditional Tibetan ways so esteemed abroad.
10616	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"China's government does not intend to destroy Tibetan culture," he said.
10617	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"But with the economy developing, the culture will change gradually, the same as in other places in the world."

10620	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	President Bush has chosen Robert B. Zoellick, a senior diplomat and trade envoy who became a top Goldman Sachs executive last year, to lead the World Bank and try to heal the bitter rifts left by the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the administration said Tuesday.
10621	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that Zoellick had emerged as the first choice of economic ministers around the world, who have been calling for someone to overcome the bank's credibility problems among donor and recipient countries alike.
10622	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	"Bob has a very strong track record working with colleagues and leaders to get results," Paulson said in an interview after word of the appointment spread.

10625	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	Zoellick, 53, has served in high-ranking foreign policy and economic policy posts under three Republican presidents, beginning with Ronald Reagan.
10626	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	His selection is to be officially announced by Bush on Wednesday.
10627	NYT_ENG_20070529.0209.LDC2009T13	He plans to visit the bank and meet with its staff almost immediately, administration officials said, and the bank's 24-member board of directors is to vote on the nomination soon afterward.

10654	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	The State Department urged North Korea to turn Yongbyon off immediately, a call echoed by Japan.

10673	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	The 34-year-old Canadian pleaded his case to Bettman on Thursday in an appeal over the incident, which came in a 5-4 over-time triumph at Dallas.
10678	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	The violation was first regarded as a 10-game ban but Bettman reviewed Peca's testimony and a video replay of the incident with the four officials who worked the game, who agreed a three-game ban was more fitting.
10679	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	Bettman used his power to add two games to the ban for what was called "physically demeaning" conduct.
10680	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	"Michael Peca crossed the line by making physical contact with referee Kimmerly," Bettman said.
10681	AFP_ENG_20081017.0066.LDC2009T13	"His conduct, regardless of the type or nature of precipitating events, was inexcusable and showed a lack of respect for our officials and for the game itself."

10760	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	Philippine merchandise exports rose 4.7 percent to 4.37 billion dollars in September from a year earlier despite a drop in the electronics sector, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said Friday.
10761	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	Shipments of electronics, which accounted for 60.7 percent of total exports in September, were down by 0.2 percent to 2.656 billion dollars compared to the same period last year, the NSO said in a statement.
10762	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	However exports of cathodes, woodcraft and furniture, automobile wiring harnesses, petroleum products, coconut oil and bananas all had double-digit rises in the same period, it said.
10764	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	The strong performance was an improvement from August, when exports fell by four percent.
10765	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	The data showed the drop in electronics exports was offset by growth in other areas, said David Cohen, director of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.
10766	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	"The 4.7 percent growth is consistent with the moderate uptrend in exports," he said.
10767	AFP_ENG_20071109.0598.LDC2009T13	The United States remained the country's biggest export market, buying 17 percent of the total or 741.8 million dollars in September.

10774	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-07-04 13:51:18 UTC
10775	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers say a museum in central Japan has right whale fossils that are at least 5 million years old, making them the oldest fossilized remains of the animal in the world, officials said Wednesday.
10776	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers working in Nagano prefecture (state) estimate the fossilized skull bones and jaw of a right whale on display at the Shinshushinmachi Fossil Museum to be 5 million to 6 million years old, said museum curator Ken Narita.
10777	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The oldest right whale fossil previously found was a skeleton that was uncovered in Italy that dates back about 4 million years, Narita said.
10778	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	"This was an amazing find, and to have found the oldest one of this type makes it truly remarkable," he said.
10779	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground.
10780	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	However, the skeleton was left undisturbed because the country was then at war, according to the museum's Web site.
10782	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Only the skull and upper jaw parts were left to be excavated, but it was not until recently that the museum could afford to get the bones dated, Narita said.
10783	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	While of the right whale genus, the animal's species is believed to have been different from those of other right whale fossils found so far, he added.
10784	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Right whale skeletons have often been found in Europe, but the Nagano fossils and their dating "raises the possibility that right whales might have originated in the North Pacific," said Toshiyuki Kimura, curator of the Gunma Museum of Natural History.
10785	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Kimura also took part in the fossil research.
10786	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Right whales are now designated an endangered species and banned for hunting by the International Whaling Commission.
10787	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The entire North Atlantic right whale population is estimated at just 350, according to a U.S. federal researcher.
10788	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Nagano is 180 kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

10793	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Like other major biotechnology companies, Biogen Idec Inc. has a cadre of talented scientists working feverishly to discover breakthrough drugs.
10794	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Over the years, the Cambridge biotech has also made acquisitions, established a $105 million venture fund, and licensed promising technologies to build a pipeline of potential life-saving therapies.
10795	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Now, Biogen Idec is trying a new approach: setting up an incubator to help biotech start-ups get off the ground by providing them with funding, technical expertise, and office and laboratory space near its Kendall Square headquarters.
10796	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	After spending more than a year getting the incubator ready, Biogen Idec plans to disclose Wednesdaythat it has signed up its first tenant, Escoublac, a new company based on research from a Columbia University researcher.
10797	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	It hopes to unveil its second tenant next month.
10798	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We felt we needed to pursue another mechanism" to support early- stage companies, said Rainer Fuchs, executive director of the Biogen Idec Innovation Incubator.
10799	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	As the biotech revolution matures, Biogen Idec and other companies are trying to find creative ways to get in on the ground floor of promising research developed outside their laboratories.
10800	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	A few, like Biogen Idec, are setting up corporate incubators.
10802	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In addition, Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge said it is considering stepping up investments in young companies or setting up an incubator of its own.
10803	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We'd love to be able to identify opportunities at an early stage," said Alan Walts, managing director of Genzyme Ventures.
10804	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We've been actively considering ideas on how we might establish some form of incubator complex."
10805	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Others are using a different strategy.
10806	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans Wednesday to say it has struck an unusual deal with Harvard University to fund research projects related to cancer, infectious diseases, and other areas Vertex is interested in - with few strings attached.
10807	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The Cambridge biotech company said Harvard researchers will be able to publish their results freely and retain the rights to any technology they develop - something barred by some corporate research funders.
10808	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Even so, Vertex chief executive Joshua Boger, who earned his doctorate in chemistry at Harvard, said he hopes the project will help his company begin a "dialogue" with Harvard researchers working in areas that could be useful to Vertex's development efforts.
10809	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a total of several million dollars over three years.
10810	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	If Harvard decides to license any technology developed, Vertex said it has the option to license it first.
10811	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model," Boger said.
10812	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Fuchs said Biogen Idec hopes to house up to four or five companies in its biotech incubator within two years.
10813	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
10814	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone biology and metabolism.
10815	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The company hopes to pioneer new treatments for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity, which have been on the increase in the United States.
10818	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Two local venture capitalists were enthusiastic about Biogen Idec's endeavor.
10823	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Walts, however, said one concern with a corporate incubator is that it could hurt start-ups' ability to work with other drug companies.
10824	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	So, he said, Genzyme is considering setting up a "virtual incubator" instead.
10825	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Genzyme would provide seed funding and technical support to new ventures, but would not physically house the companies on its property.
10826	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	That way, the companies might be better able to forge their own identities.
10828	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which approach works best.

10841	AFP_ENG_20070901.0102.LDC2009T13	"There will be countrywide protests from September 4 to 8 against these exercises."
10842	AFP_ENG_20070901.0102.LDC2009T13	India's ruling Congress party receives crucial support from left allies but the relationship has been shaky in past weeks, with the communists protesting a recently concluded civilian nuclear agreement with the United States.

10853	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the turmoil is the product of cozy relationships and corruption in Washington that can be cleaned up only by "reformers" like him and running mate Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.
10855	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
10856	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign quickly released a television advertisement after the disclosure that one financial giant, Lehman Brothers, had filed for bankruptcy and another, Merrill Lynch &amp
10857	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Co., Inc., had been bought out.
10858	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Our economy in crisis.
10859	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it," the ad said.
10860	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On the campaign trail in Florida, however, McCain sounded a slightly different note when he said the fundamentals of the economy remained "strong."
10861	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The Obama campaign immediately pounced on that as evidence that McCain is out of touch with ordinary people.
10862	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Speaking in Saint Clair Shores, Mich., Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., said: "I could walk from here to Lansing, and I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well -- unless I ran into John McCain."
10863	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning.
10864	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The past week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."
10865	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For months, Obama has been calling for increased regulation and accountability for financial institutions.
10866	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector.
10867	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections, loosened oversight and regulation, and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans have brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression," Obama's statement said.
10868	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain signaled some openness to increased regulation of financial institutions to increase transparency of their dealings -- though he was more cautious than Obama.
10869	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."
10870	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
10871	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
10872	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
10873	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
10874	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"That's shocking," said Bill Whalen, a GOP analyst at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
10875	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"If you are a Republican, you should be tagged on the economy.
10878	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The AFL-CIO has sent out a mailing to about 800,000 union voters in battleground states that attacks McCain's proposal to divert some Social Security revenues into private stock and bond accounts.
10879	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine.
10880	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Would you?"
10881	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	A labor-backed group, Americans United to Protect Social Security, is also trying to capitalize on the market turmoil to question McCain's support for private Social Security accounts.
10882	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	In a statement Monday, the group called the Lehman collapse and the Merrill Lynch sale "perfect examples" of how a privatization would "turn Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed gamble."

10885	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	A 40-year-old convicted of orchestrating and participating in the fatal stabbing and beating of a man during a 1995 robbery was executed by lethal injection Thursday in the state of Texas, officials said.
10886	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Larry Davis was put to death at Huntsville Prison at 6:19 pm local time (2319 GMT), a representative of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice told AFP.
10887	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis was accused of entering the Amarillo, Texas home of Michael Barrow with several conspirators and killing Barrow, who was stabbed with a knife and an ice pick and beaten with a pipe.
10888	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis had proclaimed he was innocent of planning and carrying out the murder.
10889	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	The execution is the third in July in the state of Texas, and the 16th in the United States since the Supreme Court in April ruled that lethal injections are constitutional.
10890	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Executions across the country had been put on hold for months as the court deliberated.
10891	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 16 executions are expected between now and September, including 10 more in Texas, the state that has put a record 409 people to death in the past 30 years.

10896	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	The names of the proposed cabinet will be submitted to the 120-seat Kosovo Parliament for adoption once it reconvenes, about two months from the PDK's victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections on Nov. 17, Thaci said.
10897	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	As the PDK leader, Thaci signed a power-sharing agreement on Monday to form a coalition with opposition LDK leader, Fatmir Sejdiu.

10899	XIN_ENG_20080109.0167.LDC2009T13	Kosovo has been run by the UN administration since NATO bombing drove the Serbian forces out of the ethnic Albanian dominated province in 1999.

10903	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	The son of Bangladesh's outgoing prime minister was remanded in custody on corruption allegations late Monday after a court rejected his application for bail, an official said.
10904	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	The capital's main court ruled that Tareque Rahman, son of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia, be detained for a further month, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said.
10905	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	"He was brought to (the) central jail in Dhaka at about 10.15 pm (1615 GMT)," he added.
10906	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	Rahman was last week arrested and remanded in custody for four days for questioning over extortion allegations.
10907	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	Rahman had been tipped as a successor to his mother.
10908	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	He is the son of assassinated former president Ziaur Rahman who played a leading role in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence.
10909	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	He is senior joint secretary of the BNP, which led a four-party coalition government until late October, when it handed power to an interim government tasked with holding elections.

10913	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	IN HASSELBECK THEY TRUST
10914	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In Hasselbeck they trust Since stepping back in as the Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season, Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
10915	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Completing 61 percent of his passes.
10916	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record 3,966 yards last year.
10917	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
10918	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
10919	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
10920	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
10921	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
10922	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	From the time he arrived in a 2001 trade with the Green Bay Packers, Brett Favre's one-time backup has had a dickens of a time living up to expectations.
10924	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	and Brock Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him the starter not once but twice in 2000.
10925	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the story of what his first season and a half were like.
10926	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
10927	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won).
10928	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
10930	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
10931	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson said.
10932	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"He is our leader, and we all need to follow his lead."
10933	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
10935	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In TV commercials for Reebok and Expedia.
10936	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In newspaper ads for Jones Soda.
10937	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In radio spots for Infiniti.
10938	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On a huge billboard, promoting the team's Web site, near the club's old headquarters in Kirkland.
10939	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On the covers of just about every preview magazine now gracing a newsstand near you.
10940	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
10941	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
10942	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
10943	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"But when I was positive he could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to go, it was actually one of our tough years."
10944	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, in fact, 2002.
10945	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
10946	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
10947	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Twice in the final five games, Hasselbeck gave new meaning to the West Coast offense by setting the franchise record for passing yards--first in San Francisco (427 yards) and then in the season finale in San Diego (449).
10948	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren said.
10949	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"And that's what happened."
10950	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.

10986	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The U.S. must be careful not to withdraw forces from Iraq too quickly because security gains could be lost, the country's top two war generals warn.
10987	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The position of Gen. David Petraeus, nominated to assume control of U.S. forces in the Middle East, and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, picked to replace Petraeus as the top commander in Iraq, all but guarantees that some 140,000 troops will be committed in Iraq for the remainder of the year.
10988	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	The nominations, if approved by the Senate as expected, would keep the administration on its present course in Iraq and hand the next administration a pair of combat-tested commanders who have relentlessly defended President George W. Bush's decision last year to build up troop levels rather than wind down the war.

11005	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Around 40 African migrants took advantage of flood damage at the border to cross into Spain's North African enclave of Melilla from Morocco on Monday, police and local government officials said.
11006	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Seventeen people were detained shortly after entering Spanish territory while the rest managed to enter the city of roughly 70,000 people which was lashed by heavy rain and strong winds on Sunday, a local police spokeswoman told AFP.
11007	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	A total of 65 migrants tried to enter through a lock in a flood channel near the border post of Beni-Enzarhich which was damaged by the rough weather and could not be closed properly, she said.
11008	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Earlier on Monday the Spanish government's office in Melilla said about 30 African migrants tried to cross into Melilla from Morocco at the border checkpoint and an unknown number had succeeded.
11009	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	Melilla has boosted police presence along its border with Morocco after Sunday's heavy rains destroyed a 30-metre (yard) stretch of wire fencing set up to keep illegal immigrants out of the city.
11010	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	The rain also flooded streets, knocked down trees and disrupted maritime and air traffic for several hours on Sunday.
11011	AFP_ENG_20081027.0169.LDC2009T13	The border barriers between Melilla and Morocco have been regularly assaulted in the past by migrants trying to enter Spanish territory, although tighter border security has reduced the frequency of such attempts.

11017	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux all posted excellent European wins, but that has been overshadowed by the fate of one Marseille fan facing an eight-year jail term following an incident at an Atletico Madrid match.
11018	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	The supporter, Santos Mirasierra, is accused of inciting disorder, attacking a policemen and resisting arrest, and has been detained in Spain since the incident on October 1.
11019	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	And, instead of focusing on Saturday's match with Grenoble, Marseille players were this week rallying to Mirasierra's cause.
11020	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	"We have just learned that eight years have been called for," said team captain Lorik Cana on Thursday.

11025	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	Gerets said he was horrified by the reaction of police in Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium, where it is alleged they used excessive force to quell the unfolding violence on the terraces.

11046	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	For varied reasons and contradictory action by unions, problems afflicting Togolese workers have not been addressed in a concerted manner, notably the situation of nearly 3,000 casual workers in the public service which has never been given the attention it deserves to ensure their full integration, affirmed the unionists.
11047	XIN_ENG_20071205.0313.LDC2009T13	Togolese Public Service Minister Foli-Bazi Katari said the government will support "any efforts deployed to prevent leadership squabbles experienced by a number of unions in the country."

11074	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I saw the lights go out and I thought, 'I'm meant to do something now,'" he joked after the inaugural race to use the start.
11075	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I have to work on my reactions."
11077	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts -- the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead stop on a grid.
11079	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Once all the red lights go out, you drop your clutch and go, and that's the start," said Wilson, who had the pole for the race.
11081	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car had wanted to use standing starts at the beginning of the season, but it was delayed for further testing until the Grand Prix of Portland, the fourth race of the season.
11082	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The move toward standing starts got a mixed reaction from drivers.
11083	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Points leader and three-time defending series champion Sebastien Bourdais was especially vocal with concerns that drivers could stall at the start, setting up rear-end accidents all over the grid.
11084	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total disaster," he said.
11085	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Many drivers already had experience with the procedure.
11086	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The Champ Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for the most part.
11087	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because there's so much more power," Rahal said.
11088	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to put the power down on these cars as it is.
11089	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	In third gear coming out of a corner it can be hard to do.
11090	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	So doing it from a stop is a tough thing, especially when it is wet."
11091	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Fellow rookie Robert Doornbos brought in perspective from two seasons with Formula One.
11092	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains Doornbos.
11093	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Here it is all driver.
11094	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	If you mess up, you stall and have a big problem.
11095	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I did three or four and it went quite well.
11096	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
11097	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to the rolling start.
11098	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled, which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland.
11099	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean it's never going to happen.
11100	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It means I was a little more pessimistic than the truth.
11101	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Definitely put on a good show."
11102	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Cleveland will be the next chance for fans to see the standing start, which Champ Car is expected to use the remainder of the season.
11103	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But many drivers say they'd like the series to keep rolling starts in the mix, too.
11104	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm not sure which I prefer.
11106	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season.
11107	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I think that's the best way.
11108	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	To master both skills is the best thing for the drivers."

11111	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
11112	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
11113	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.

11116	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Paul Hamm had a broken right hand and strained left rotator cuff.
11117	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle.
11118	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	After being notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
11119	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USADA said it had "absolutely no concern" the shot was for anything but medicinal purposes.
11120	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	As part of his punishment, Hamm's results from the second day of nationals were wiped out.
11121	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm would still have made the team.

11140	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Coach Mark Thompson became the seventh man in AFL history to have both captained and coached a team to premiership victory.
11141	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	He had previous captained Essendon to the championship in 1993.
11142	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's 119-point win was the largest in grand final history, dwarfing Hawthorn's 96-point win over Melbourne in 1998.
11143	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Cats dominated the match, outscoring Port Adelaide 5.7 to 2.2 in the first quarter, before kicking five goals in the first 12 minutes of the second quarter to build a 52-point lead.
11144	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong were on top in every aspect of the contest, with their defense -- which has been the best in the competition all season -- keeping Port Adelaide to their lowest score of the year.
11146	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"It's been a long time coming but it's worth the wait."
11147	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Geelong's Steve Johnson was named Man of the Match.
11148	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Johnson began the season suspended for off-field behaviour and ended up an All- Australian and premiership player.
11149	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	Johnson kicked four goals from half-forward.

11151	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	Czech historians are to pore over communist-era secret police files kept on the country's priests to establish the level of collaboration by the Church, the Czech theology academy said on Friday.
11152	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	"To open up a process of reflection, first and foremost one has to have an objective point of view on what is hidden in the archives of the StB (the secret police)," Stanislav Novotny, head of the academy, told AFP.
11153	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	The announcement followed an agreement between the academy and the interior ministry to allow access to the files, and a call for a national enquiry earlier this month from the archbishop of Prague, Miloslav Vlk.
11154	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	Cardinal Vlk has said that he has a list of around 40 priests who admitted privately to him in years immediately following the fall of communism in 1989 that they were collaborators.
11156	AFP_ENG_20070209.0545.LDC2009T13	In Poland, the newly installed archbishop of Warsaw, Stanislaw Wielgus, was forced into a dramatic resignation last month after revelations that he had collaborated with the communist-era secret police.

11160	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn finished with 6-72 and South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs -- with two days to spare -- after West Indies' second innings ended at 317-9.

11162	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	South Africa allrounder Shaun Pollock, his country's highest-ever test wicket-taker, announced his retirement after the match.
11163	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	West Indies won the first test by 128 runs and South Africa leveled the series with a seven-wicket win in the second test.
11164	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But West Indies faced an uphill task to save the third test after South Africa dismissed the visitors for 139 in their first innings at Kingsmead Stadium, and then scored 556-4 in reply.
11168	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We must remember South Africa is the No. 2 team in the world, and we are a young team with new coaching staff."
11174	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Darren Sammy was out for 17 in a looping caught-and-bowled by Steyn, who also hit the offstumps of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards -- both for ducks -- to wrap up the match.
11175	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the series at an average of 19.10.
11176	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Samuels and Bravo saw West Indies reach 230-3 at tea after a poor start to the day.
11178	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
11179	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before wicket for 37.
11180	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut back in on him.
11184	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock also averaged 32.31 with the bat, hitting a total of 3,781 test runs.
11185	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	South African captain Graeme Smith acknowledged the contribution Steyn made to the win, but said the day belonged to Pollock.
11186	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"I hope the whole of South Africa knows what a great player will be missing from our team now, he is one of the all-time greats," Smith said.

11195	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith and de Villiers, who hit nine fours and two sixes in 45 balls, shared a 134-run opening stand to set up South Africa's comfortable victory, four days before the group's defining clash with Australia.

11209	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The two openers were never troubled, until de Villiers was caught on the long-off fence by Brown off Glenn Rogers in the 16th over with victory in sight.
11211	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The break didn't help Prince, who was caught by McCallum at short-cover for 21 from Haq's offspin with South Africa on 162.

11239	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush to sign US-India nuclear deal law
11240	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush was to sign legislation on Wednesday to enact a landmark US-India nuclear deal, in a lavish ceremony to highlight how the pact helps usher in a new era in relations.
11241	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee will make a surprise visit Friday to Washington so that he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice can formally sign the accord itself, a senior US official said.
11242	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the deal in July 2005, touching off a difficult battle with wary lawmakers on either side and critics who warn it undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear know-how.
11243	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The agreement offers India access to sophisticated US technology and cheap atomic energy in return for allowing UN inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities -- but not military nuclear sites.
11244	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Washington imposed a ban on US-Indian civilian nuclear trade after India's first nuclear test in 1974, but US officials have said a new approach is needed to help the world's largest democracy meet its booming energy needs at a time of skyrocketing oil prices and global warming fears.
11245	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of India’s emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an independent course from Washington.
11246	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The ceremony on Wednesday will draw Vice President Dick Cheney, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, and India's ambassador to Washington, Ronen Sen, to the White House's ornate East Room.
11247	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US lawmakers, and roughly 200 guests including Indian-American community leaders, will also attend the signing ceremony, according to Bush spokesman Carlton Carroll.
11248	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Neither Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama nor Republican rival John McCain were expected to break from campaigning to attend the signing.
11249	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership," Carroll said in a statement.
11250	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner," he said.
11251	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls global atomic trade.
11252	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
11253	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a foreign policy success.
11254	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
11255	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Singh also had a rough ride over the deal at home: The main opposition Hindu nationalists and the Communists have both slammed it as curbing India's military options and bringing the country's foreign policy too much under US influence.
11256	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	New Delhi was reluctant to sign the deal before Bush inked the pact but pledged during Rice's visit to India late last week to do so soon after.

11258	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua)
11260	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	The scene, which took place Tuesday afternoon at Israeli President Shimon Peres's official residence in Jerusalem, is an indication of Israeli people's growing enthusiasm and expectation for the Beijing Olympics in August.
11261	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	During the welcoming ceremony at Peres's official residence, the president, who is scheduled to attend the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, expressed his hope that Israeli delegation will give good performance in the upcoming international sports event.

11263	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	I hope that every member of the delegation will do his or her utmost and get good result," said Peres in an address to Israeli delegation, adding that the clothes the delegation members will wear during the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony -- blue-striped white T-shirts and white trousers -- look extremely fabulous.
11265	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	"We are looking forward to the Games, and hope that Israeli athletes can get good results," said Zinger.
11266	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	However, Zinger noted that due to the fierce competition, the goal of Israeli delegation remains the same: trying to claim one or two medals in the Beijing Olympics.
11267	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	Israeli delegation is likely to win medals in several fields, including judo, sailing and tennis, the secretary general added.
11268	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	Gilad Lustig, director of Israel's Elite Sport Department, a body set up in 1984 to oversee the selection of athletes for the Olympics, said that "I hope we claim between one or two medals and reach between six and eight finals."
11269	XIN_ENG_20080722.0265.LDC2009T13	Like Zinger, Michael Kolganov, who will be the Israeli flag bearer at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, told Xinhua that he is prepared for the Games.
11272	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	US auto industry expects weak January sales as a tough year begins
11273	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	DETROIT 2008-01-30 21:10:01 UTC
11276	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers report January sales on Friday.
11277	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Car sales were remarkably slow in January, probably in part because of dramatic stock market fluctuations that flustered consumers at a time when the housing market and other economic uncertainties were also making headlines," said Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry analysis at the auto information site Edmunds.com.
11279	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	January sales are normally lower after the holiday rush in December.
11280	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	But analysts say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when automakers introduce new products and the election brings political uncertainty to an end.
11281	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, buyers are skittish.
11282	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy in January than they had been in December.
11283	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The group said most of the 5,000 U.S. households surveyed expect business conditions and employment to deteriorate further in the months ahead.
11284	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts say that will have a direct affect on the auto industry.
11285	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Our sense is macroeconomic pressures, particularly deteriorating consumer confidence and gas 'permanently' above $3 a gallon, will increasingly catch up with consumers throughout 2008, weighing on demand for durable goods," Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said in a recent note to investors.
11286	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
11287	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said that while consumers can take comfort in the fact that gas prices seem to be stabilizing, they are still scared off by the weak labor market.
11288	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Barry predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993.
11289	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Other analysts forecast higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales will likely fall below 16 million.
11290	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers sold 16.3 million vehicles in 2007.
11291	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit sales to rental-car fleets.
11292	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Ford reduced rental fleet sales by 32 percent in 2007 and has vowed to make more -- although less aggressive -- cuts in 2007.
11293	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	GM cut fleet sales by 15 percent and plans more cuts this year, while Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press said earlier this month that rental fleet sales propped up 2007 results but would be cut this year.
11294	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the line on incentive spending.
11295	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers have been trying to rely less on costly incentives, and Nesvold said the level of December spending -- an average of $2,746 (euro1,854) per vehicle industrywide -- was down from a year earlier.
11296	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Still, December spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to shore up the market with incentives.
11298	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	GM and Toyota Motor Corp., already locked in a battle in the full-size pickup market, could pile on more incentives to hold onto their share as Ford and Chrysler introduce new pickups this fall.
11299	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toyota and GM were already putting nearly $3,000 (euro2,026) per vehicle on their new full-size trucks in 2007.
11301	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Honda's sales were strong in the last few months of 2007 thanks to its Honda Fit subcompact and redesigned Honda Accord sedan, and that could carry into 2008 as consumers look for more fuel-efficient cars.

11360	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2008-10-08 20:45:49 UTC
11361	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	John McCain's health care plan would reduce the ranks of the roughly 45 million uninsured Americans by about 21.1 million people if fully implemented by 2010, while Barack Obama's would reduce the number by 26.6 million, a new analysis predicts.
11362	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Some previous reviews of the two presidential candidates' health plans indicated that Republican McCain's proposals would amount to little more than a wash when it comes to the number of uninsured in the United States.
11363	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The analysis released Wednesday by The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, drew a more optimistic scenario about the overall number of people who would get health coverage under McCain's plan.
11364	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The cost for both candidates' plans are enormous.
11365	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain's plan was projected to cost more than $2 trillion from 2010 through 2019.
11366	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Democrat Obama's plan would cost $1.17 trillion.
11367	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Neither candidate provides specifics on how to cover the costs, The Lewin Group said.
11368	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The United States, which has a population of about 300 million, is one of the few western countries without universal health care.
11369	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain has proposed two distinct changes to the current system.
11370	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The first is a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals or $5,000 for a family that buys health insurance.
11371	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The credit would replace the tax break people now get for obtaining health coverage through their work.
11372	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Second, McCain calls for letting people shop across state lines when buying insurance, essentially letting millions bypass states where insurance is more expensive and comprehensive.
11373	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	About half of the nation's uninsured adults are ages 19-34.
11374	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	They are the youngest and cheapest to cover, and they are the ones that would generally gain coverage under McCain's proposal, Sheils said.
11375	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Obama's plan would expand health insurance coverage through public programs.
11377	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	In all, about 16 million people would gain coverage through those programs.
11378	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Another 10 million would use government subsidies to buy insurance coverage.

11389	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NO CHECKS FOR BOMBS IN CERTIFIED AIR CARGO
11390	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
11391	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, President Bush signed a bill into law that requires some type of inspection of all freight carried on passenger planes.
11393	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in getting the legislation blocked.
11394	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But in late July, Democrats passed the measure.
11395	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The new law was celebrated as a victory by pilot and flight attendant unions, as well as its main congressional champion, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Malden.
11396	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey put a video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website, proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger planes."
11397	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given three years under the law to develop a full inspection program, says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
11398	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	TSA spokesman Christopher White said freight "is inherently screened" if it is packed with tamper-evident seals at a facility that meets federal security standards.
11399	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by hand, just like bags checked by passengers.
11402	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"As usual, the TSA is working to circumvent what we want and what we feel is the best type of security," said Captain Paul Onorato, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.
11403	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines up on the deck where they run it through.
11405	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the TSA's procedures are finalized.
11406	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the early signs, he said, show that "it will be necessary to very closely monitor how this law is implemented."
11407	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline industry would even think that they could get away with anything less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto passenger planes," Markey said.
11408	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.
11409	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press conferences, and issued 17 news releases.
11410	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He is known for using props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline cargo.
11411	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the passenger airline industry had stoutly resisted any such requirement, saying it would cause delays that could jeopardize $4.3 billion per year in cargo business for air carriers.
11413	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
11414	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The company that makes the machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without unpacking them.
11416	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Immediately after Democrats won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill passed.
11419	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags" within three years.
11422	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The law requires that if such data checks are used, they must be paired with a physical check or screening method approved by the TSA.
11427	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline industry, declined to comment on the new screening law.
11428	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
11429	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
11430	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
11434	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.

11456	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The deaths Friday raised to 34 the number of soldiers killed since fighting between the army and Fatah Islam militants began on May 20.

11458	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	About 50 armored carriers, battle tanks and military vehicles from elite units massed at the northern edge of the camp and drove toward the forward positions, according to an AP Television News crew at the scene.
11459	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling, accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the troops were in close combat with the militants.
11461	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's northern edge.
11463	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	A resident from inside the camp said some Fatah Islam positions were overtaken and destroyed in the push.
11464	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of militant reprisals.
11465	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"What we have decided is to deal with Fatah Islam as a group, a terrorist group taking hostages who are left in the camp," said Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh.
11466	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He told AP Television News in Beirut that the army may be seeking to isolate the militants.
11467	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"I think the army is determined this time to go ahead and probably to reduce several pockets of Fatah Islam terrorist," he said.

11500	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Giuseppe Verdi was worried about "all those dead bodies" in his "La forza del destino."
11501	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, there weren't enough for some in the audience.
11503	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	He and others booing the performance were clearly calling for the head of producer David Pountney and others responsible for the new production of "La forza" for savaging the Italian maestro with their all-too-free interpretation of his opera classic.
11504	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	True, some of the settings in this Vienna State Opera production were more "Stagecoach" than opera.
11505	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Lightly clad cowgirls hefting six-guns were stand-ins for the camp followers of the soldiers in the Verdi opera.
11506	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tableaux of military life were turned into grisly portraits of Hell with a touch of Bosch, mixed with T.S. Eliot.
11507	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And Pountney's skeptical view of religion made the final moments of the hero's reconciliation with God, Heaven and the death of his beloved Leonora a hard sell.
11508	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Adding to difficulties is that even without Pountney, this opera calls for an indulgent audience ready to accept a plot almost as cliche as the notion of "it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
11510	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As he drops his pistol in submission it goes off, killing the elderly nobleman and setting into notion the "power of destiny" that ultimately leads to two more deaths

11514	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	So in the version performed Saturday, Alvaro remains alive and redeemed, though deeply depressed.
11515	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that the audience was spared that condition Saturday was due less to the controversial production and more to the excellence of the musical performances both on stage and in the pit.
11517	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Under his baton, the violin section sounded as if one powerful instrument.
11518	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His horns packed more oomph than any brass band.
11521	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The principals also rose to the musical challenge.
11525	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Among her highlights on Saturday: "Madre pietosa Vergine."
11526	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	(Holy Mother hear my prayer.)
11527	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The sporadic boos mixed with the bravos for Salvatore Licitra were undeserved.
11528	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His warm and broad tenor was a lovely match for Stemme, making him a thoroughly enjoyable Alvaro.
11529	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	But the best male role of the evening was given by Carlos Alvarez.
11530	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As Don Carlo, Leonora's vengeful brother, his rich and vibrant baritone, coupled with a menacing and possessed stage presence, had all eyes and ears focused on him, at times even when he was not at center stage.

11541	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Panama's first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos extended her gratitude Tuesday to Taiwan for its contributions to several social welfare programs in Panama, including the construction of elementary schools and water conduits.
11543	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Hou noted that the projects, which also include the construction of highways and the expansion of a football stadium, are all examples of bilateral cooperation.
11544	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	Once the highways are completed, Hou said, the agricultural produce grown in rural villages can be easily transported and sold in urban areas, while the hospital that Taiwan promised to help build in eastern Panama Province will greatly benefit the poor in that area.
11545	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	According to the first lady, President Martin Torrijos will have constructed 108 elementary schools in rural areas before he steps down in August next year, which have improved significantly the level of education in poorer regions.
11546	CNA_ENG_20080416.0023.LDC2009T13	As to the football stadium Rommel Fernandez in Panama City, which Taiwan has helped to expand, First Vice President Samuel Lewis said that it will be able to accommodate some 40,000 people, double the original 20,000 capacity, once the construction work is completed and be suitable for international matches.

11585	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	A MAYOR ' S FALL FROM GRACE
11586	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	It was nothing more than the mayor's annual budget speech, but in Newton, the event had all the trappings of the president's State of the Union address.
11587	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	A delegation of aldermen escorted Mayor David Cohen into the chamber of Newton's huge Georgian Revival-style City Hall.
11588	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Everyone was asked to rise.
11589	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen stepped forward, followed by an entourage of city department heads.
11590	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His smile looked more pained than happy, and he waved stiffly at board members and the handful of people who sat in the audience.
11591	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.
11592	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once heralded as a brilliant state legislator and a can-do mayor loved by the wealthy and well-connected in his hometown, Cohen, 60, is expected to make an announcement today about his election plans for 2009.
11593	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Many of his allies expect him to call it quits.
11594	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The fall from grace followed missteps richly woven into a city that prides itself on good schools, parks, and expensive real estate.
11595	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The new $197 million high school Cohen has staked his reputation on has become the most expensive school construction in state history and a symbol of suburban excess.
11596	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The local weekly twice called for him to leave office at the end of his term.
11598	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	And in the midst of these battles, Cohen this week proposed increasing his salary of $97,876 by 28 percent, quickly withdrawing the idea after it was greeted with derision.
11599	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"It is a sad irony that the mayor may best serve the city he loves by announcing that he will not run for another term," said longtime supporter Paul Levy, CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
11600	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has become a kind of lightning rod on the ((override)) issue.
11602	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the day the proposed salary increase became public, Cohen sat in his oak-paneled office and in an interview defended the high school, the override, and his reputation.
11603	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There have been some concerns that the programming is extravagant, that the building" is extravagant, Cohen said, growing angry with a reporter's questions.

11606	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	and expensive technological efficiencies, like a fuel efficient heating system, account for the school's high cost, he said.
11609	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"They ((critics)) say there's not enough money and there's too much money.
11611	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His spokesman, Jeremy Solomon, followed up the same day in an e-mail saying the "mayor feels badly" about the interview and "understands his tone ... was not conducive to a productive interview."
11612	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Newton may be a small city of 80,000, but politicians frequently talk about residents' "expectation of excellence," especially when it comes to schools.
11613	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's plans for the new Newton North High were clearly designed to meet that standard.
11617	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Since then, costs continued to soar.
11621	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has faced the Board of Aldermen on many, many occasions and not only to present good news."
11623	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's coalition of support had already begun to crumble, undermined by the cost of the building, an unrelated fight with the city firefighters union, and increasingly feisty aldermen.
11624	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Ward 4 Alderwoman at Large Amy Mah Sangiolo, who took office the same year Cohen became mayor, said the mayor effectively used Solomon, his $97,000-a-year spokesman, to shield himself from critics and the media.
11625	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She said it was a big change from her early days in office when Cohen invited board members to meetings in his office, and she thought they shared many similar views on education (she supported the new school) and the environment.
11626	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She has since broken with Cohen.
11628	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	What has his vision been?"
11629	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Sangiolo said.
11631	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's refusal to acknowledge critics' concerns has baffled even supporters.
11632	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Martina Jackson, cochairwoman of the Newton City Democratic Committee and a personal friend of 30 years, said Cohen is not a glad hander.
11633	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He can be "awkward socially" but funny, she said.
11634	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was a state legislator, he called her to pose this Woody Allen-esque question: If police arrested Marcel Marceau, would officers have to mime him his Miranda rights?
11638	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen surely hopes his legacy will be Newton North High School.
11640	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Brooke Lipsitt, a former president of the Board of Aldermen and a Cohen supporter, said it's clear the mayor's unpopularity will cost the override votes on May 20.
11641	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I'm sorry about that," she said.

11686	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN and Michael Moore trade angry accusations over `Sicko ' accuracy
11687	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2007-07-16 21:25:15 UTC
11688	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"Sicko" filmmaker Michael Moore called a truce Monday in his weeklong fight with CNN that flared when the network accused him of misstating facts in his popular documentary about the health- care system.
11689	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore had promised the network over the weekend that "I'm about to become your worst nightmare," leading CNN to post on its Web site a remarkably lengthy response to his accusations.
11690	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore noted in an interview Monday that CNN had admitted to two mistakes in its reporting on "Sicko" and that he is willing to move on.
11691	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I trust the intelligence of the American people," Moore told The Associated Press.
11692	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's a whole lot more to do with this other than I and others are going to be a lot more skeptical with what I see on CNN."
11693	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN, in its statement, noted that it has given Moore multiple opportunities to discuss his concerns about the report on the air.
11694	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic that someone who has made a career out of holding powerful interests accountable is so sensitive to having his own work held up to the light by impartial journalists, as we did in our examination of `Sicko,'" CNN said.
11695	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Shortly before Moore appeared for an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, the network ran a report by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that had done some fact-checking on Moore's movie.
11696	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Gupta's report made Moore furious, leading to a contentious segment with Blitzer and a debate with Gupta on "Larry King Live" later in the week.
11698	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In Gupta's report, CNN had said that Moore had reported that Cuba spends $25 (euro18) per person for health care.
11699	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In fact, the movie estimates Cuba's spending at $251 (euro182) per person.
11700	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN blamed a transcription error for its mistake and apologized for it on and off the air.
11701	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network accuses Moore of "cherry-picking" numbers from different academic studies to make his arguments stronger.
11702	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN said it believes in essentially comparing apples with apples.
11703	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he tried to use the most recent data available.
11704	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore was also angry that Gupta interviewed Paul Keckley, who works for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, as a critic of "Sicko."
11705	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said Deloitte's chairman is Tommy Thompson, President George W. Bush's former health and human services secretary, and that Keckley had made political contributions to Republican candidates and organizations.
11706	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The second mistake came not in Gupta's original report -- where Keckley was correctly identified as representing Deloitte -- but in an on-air debate where Gupta claimed Keckley was working for Vanderbilt University.
11707	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"His only affiliation is with Vanderbilt University," Gupta said.
11708	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"We checked it, Michael.
11709	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We checked his conflict of interest.
11710	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We do ask those questions."
11711	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	While CNN noted Moore was correct in pointing out Keckley had left Vanderbilt last year, it said Keckley's comments were factual and descriptive.
11712	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Deloitte says it does not have a political agenda.
11713	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In other instances, CNN said Moore appeared to be creating a fight where none really existed.
11714	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network said it was comfortable letting viewers judge for themselves.
11715	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he believed it was important for him to let people know his side.

11791	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Not in Hollywood.
11792	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	As it usually does during economic downturns, the movie business has come on strong, expected to set a summer revenue record of about $4.2 billion from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers.
11793	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	That would put Hollywood a fraction ahead of the previous record of $4.18 billion in summer 2007, though accounting for inflation, the actual number of tickets sold -- about 587 million -- is down 3.5 percent.

11829	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Against Ottawa, Bruins' Thornton had the upper hands
11830	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His name is not on the scoring summary, but Shawn Thornton left an impression in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators yesterday.
11831	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Twice the burly fourth-line wing saw a teammate knocked to the ice and stepped into the offending Senator with his fists cocked, standing up for his teammate, hockey-style.
11832	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates, and his coach.
11833	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks.
11834	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's the best time of year to play - the last 10-15 games and the playoffs, that's what you're playing for.

11837	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
11838	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and Thornton helped shake it loose.
11839	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The first period was slogging along scoreless when Neil caught Jeremy Reich at the Ottawa blue line with an elbow, forcing Reich from the game with a head injury.
11840	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	A few minutes later, Thornton called Neil aside and opened up a little chat with his fists.
11841	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on Reicher," said Thornton.
11842	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see it because I was forechecking right away.
11843	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"We know what's on the line, all 20 guys are playing hard and that's the best thing it's done.

11845	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period, but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded scrum.
11847	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton was incensed.
11849	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His body language betrayed his rink rage.

11852	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It was more reactionary than anything else.
11853	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I had just come on the ice and I saw Stuart laying there.

11856	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Though Stuart returned a few minutes later (he called the injury to his right arm a "stinger"), Thornton had made his point.
11857	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"First of all, we know what he did to step up and protect our players because there were a couple of questionable hits there," said Bruins coach Claude Julien.
11858	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"He stepped up and did his job that way.
11862	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart acknowledged the game is a little easier knowing Thornton is around.
11863	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game," Stuart said.
11864	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton, who has four goals and three assists in 54 games, had a slow start to the season, and missed 20 games with a foot injury, but returned in mid-December, leaner and fitter, and just as mean.

11872	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	A blast near a police station in northern Algeria early Sunday wounded 21 people, including six police officers, the Interior Ministry said.
11873	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The explosion occurred in Tizi-Ouzou, a northern city about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the capital, Algiers, the ministry said in a statement that gave no further details.
11874	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said, however, that the explosion appeared to have come from a van.
11876	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The group, formerly known as the GSPC, grew out of an insurgency in the 1990s.
11877	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The violence, which left as many as 200,000 dead, was prompted by the army's cancellation of 1992 legislative elections that an Islamist party was poised to win.
11879	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Many attacks in Algeria have targeted the national security services and military, while others have struck foreigners.

11890	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In Dickens World, rat-catchers hunt vermin on London's cobbled streets, pickpockets roam the alleys -- and visitors line up for a fun-tastic water ride.
11891	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A new theme park inspired by the work of 19th-century novelist Charles Dickens aims to transform a 70,000 square foot (6,500 square meter) warehouse near London into a teeming -- and family- friendly -- corner of Victorian England.
11892	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Literary purists may balk, but the attraction's backers are confident.
11893	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"Would Dickens approve?
11894	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Yes," said Thelma Grove of the Dickens Fellowship, a global association of the writer's fans.
11896	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In more than a dozen sprawling novels, from "The Pickwick Papers" to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," Dickens created a rich tapestry of 19th-century England, peopled by struggling workers, aspiring clerks, jaded lawyers, ambitious orphans, rogues, runaways and thieves.
11897	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Still in print after more than a century, the books have inspired numerous film and television adaptations and a popular musical, "Oliver!"
11898	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Dickens World's backers say they are trying to capture that vibrant landscape in their 62 million pound (US$125 million
11900	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They insist it is "based on a credible and factual account of Charles Dickens' works and the world in which he lived."
11901	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"You can't Disney-fy Dickens," said managing director Kevin Christie, "because he was better and he was first."
11903	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Visitors who pay the 12.50 pounds (US$25
11904	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro18) admission charge -- 7.50 pounds (US$15
11905	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro11) for children -- will have the chance to see the Ghost of Christmas Past in Ebeneezer Scrooge's haunted house, be hectored by a schoolmaster at Dotheboys Hall -- the dismal school from "Nicholas Nickleby" -- and peer into the fetid cells of notorious Newgate Prison.
11907	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	2-for-1 specials.
11908	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The little ones can play in Fagin's Den, an area for preschoolers named -- alarmingly, some might think -- after the gangmaster of the band of thieves in "Oliver Twist."
11909	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	There may be a whiff of kitsch in the air at Dickens World, but its supporters include some serious Dickens buffs.
11910	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's like a dream come true," said Grove, who acted as an adviser on the project.
11911	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	She helped ensure that everything from the names on the faux shopfronts to the pharmacy offering "syrup of squirrels" was true to the Victorian period.
11912	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"People who don't know their Dickens won't know whether they are authentic or not," she said.
11913	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"But I want to be above criticism."
11914	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	At the moment, Dickens World is a work in progress.
11915	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A planned opening this week was postponed at the last minute until May 25 due to a glitch with the "4D animatronic theater show" about Dickens' life and work.
11916	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	As journalists toured the site Wednesday, hard-hatted construction workers unfurled a banner featuring a Victorian skyline across the front of the hangar-like building in Chatham, 35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of London.
11917	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Promotional literature for Dickens World promises the "sounds and smells" of the 19th century.
11918	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	For now it sounds like a construction site and smells of sawdust and fresh paint.
11919	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be a few weeks, but you can see we're getting there," Christie said.
11920	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	One aspect of the attraction is inarguably authentic -- Dickens' links with this corner of southeast England run deep.
11921	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The writer spent several years of his childhood in Chatham, where his father worked as a clerk at the Royal Navy dockyards, and he returned to the region late in life.
11922	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The nearby marshland was memorably evoked in "Great Expectations."
11923	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Chatham's docks are long closed, and Dickens World -- sandwiched between an outlet mall and a multiplex cinema -- is part of the region's attempt at redevelopment.
11924	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Management and staff alike are embracing the project with enthusiasm.
11925	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's a living experience where you can go back in time," said Eddie Sampson, who plays rat-catcher and "gentle rogue" Ned Fiendish, one of several characters who wander the streets of Dickens World adding Victorian color and dispensing directions to visitors.
11926	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Sampson has taken to his work with gusto, creating an elaborate biography for his character.
11927	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	He says Ned never knew his father, fought at the battle of Waterloo, supplements rat-catching with a bit of housebreaking but has a good heart.
11928	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"I invented the entire story," Sampson said with pride.
11929	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Managers hope the staff's enthusiasm will rub off on visitors.They want Dickens to be thought of as fun.
11930	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Asked for the park's mission statement, Grove quotes the admirable Mr. Sleary from Dickens' "Hard Times": "People must be amused, squire, somehow.
11931	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They can't be always a-working, nor yet they can't be always a-learning."

11938	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they were resisting the military onslaught.

11942	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	Further south, in the Ampara district, three commandos were killed and 16 wounded in a powerful explosion on Friday, military officials said.
11943	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	Government troops, backed by artillery and multi-barrel rocket fire, have been on the offensive in the districts of Batticaloa and Ampara, where the Tamil rebels control a vast jungle area known as Thoppigala.
11944	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The latest offensive is the biggest since troops captured the town of Vakarai from the Tigers in January after weeks of heavy fighting in Batticaloa district.
11945	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The government has said it wants to clear the entire eastern province of Tamil Tiger rebels, and Thoppigala is the last rebel bastion in Batticaloa and Ampara districts.
11946	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	More than 4,000 people have been killed in escalating fighting since December 2005 even though the two sides agreed to a truce five years ago.

11950	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
11952	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She said she had purchased private insurance, but dropped it last summer when she turned 35.
11953	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
11954	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Most people say 22, but thanks,'' Childress responded amid laughter from the audience.
11955	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
11957	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush asked.
11958	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president has proposed making medical insurance premiums deductible for all Americans, up to $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for individuals.
11960	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses.
11961	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher.
11962	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president's proposals have gotten a frosty reception on Capitol Hill.
11963	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Democrats, who took control of both chambers of Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become more affordable for the self-employed.
11964	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	But they say that the biggest problem is the 47 million people in the United States with no health insurance, and that the president's proposal would help only a small fraction of them.
11965	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns.
11966	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Instead, they favor a tax credit for premiums, which they say would help all taxpayers regardless of their filing status.
11967	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``While the president's focus on health care is important, his proposals will only worsen the crisis by undermining the quality coverage that millions of working families now rely on, and replacing it with a tax break that will benefit the wealthiest Americans,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Wednesday in a statement.

12008	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng told the New Straits Times his government was in a bind as the buildings exceed the 15-metre (49-foot) maximum UNESCO height guidelines but were approved by a previous government before heritage status was granted.

12010	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	The chief minister said the state government would discuss the matter with the Culture, Arts and Heritage ministry to find a solution.

12013	AFP_ENG_20081120.0780.LDC2009T13	Georgetown along with the port city of Malacca were awarded heritage status in July after years of waiting for recognition.

12022	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The House approved a companion measure by a wide margin.
12023	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Yet, the bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sits in limbo.
12025	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Arizona Republican Senator Jon Kyl.
12026	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that Kyl was the one who invoked a parliamentary procedure known as a "secret hold" last month to block the bill from sailing through the Senate without debate.
12030	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government advocates are blitzing Capitol Hill in a last- ditch effort to win approval for the measure before Congress recesses for the Fourth of July holiday-the 41st anniversary of the bill.
12033	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's hold on the Open Government Act eliminates majority rule in favor of the "idiosyncrasies of one individual," Aftergood said.
12036	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Cornyn-Leahy bill attempts to reduce the long backlog of FOIA requests by imposing consequences for missing the 20-day statutory deadline.
12039	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Senator Reid has worked hard to clear Republican objections and wants it to the floor as soon as possible," Manley said.
12040	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	In order to bring it to the floor for debate, Reid needs Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to sign off.
12042	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	An aide to McConnell said that the debate proposal did not permit discussion of Kyl's concerns.
12043	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Until those concerns are addressed, the bill will not move.
12044	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's a sad day in democracy when an open government bill does not see the light of day," said Rick Blum, director of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups.
12045	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	If Kyl has concerns, those concerns should be openly debated so the bill can move forward, Blum said.
12046	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's office did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment for this story.
12047	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	However, Kyl did list his objections to the bill in a Senate Judiciary Committee report filed in Congress.
12048	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl, a Judiciary Committee member, baffled open government groups because he objected in writing after allowing the measure to clear the committee by voice vote.
12049	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Although the goals of the Open Government Act are laudable, the bill reported by the committee has a number of flaws that must be addressed," Kyl said in his dissenting opinion.
12050	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.
12051	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl was concerned that the provision would inadvertently release sensitive information about national security.
12053	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Overall, Kyl's list of concerns mirrors the Justice Department's concerns.
12054	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	And Kyl objects to a provision that would allow requesters to seek attorneys fees when they challenge denials in federal court.
12059	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Some have reported that they spend thousands of dollars in legal fees only to have the government cough up the records in the 11th hour.
12060	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have tried to address Kyl's concerns over the past month.
12061	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, personally appealed to Kyl, a fellow member of the panel, to no avail, according to a senior Democratic staffer.
12063	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Staffers for Cornyn and Leahy say they are hopeful that Kyl will ultimately support the measure.
12064	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Senator Cornyn does not comment on private conversations he might have with other senators, but suffice to say, this bill is one of his top priorities," said Brian Walsh, spokesperson for Cornyn.
12065	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"He believes the Senate should act on this good government legislation as soon as possible."
12066	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law needs to be improved, Leahy said.
12068	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Today, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIA's 41-year history," Leahy said.
12069	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"This bill would help to reverse this trend and to restore the public's trust in their government."

12072	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Frank J. Ayd Jr., a psychiatrist who by studying his patients' responses to early antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs helped give birth to and nurture the field of psychopharmacology, died Monday in Baltimore.
12073	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He was 87.
12074	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
12075	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd's clinical results were usually influential and sometimes stunning.
12076	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In May 1955, he reported at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association on his use of two antipsychotic drugs, chlorpromazine, best known by the trade name Thorazine, and reserpine.
12077	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd, who received the first permit from the Food and Drug Administration to use Thorazine to treat schizophrenia, found that many of the 300 patients he treated with the drugs no longer needed hospitalization in a specialized setting and could be treated in a general hospital or nursing home.
12078	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He said 80 percent were usefully employed.
12079	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported that his finding had "profound economic implications," because it offered a way to cut the $1 billion the nation was then spending on mental illness.
12080	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It said many patients could receive immediate treatment and avoid long- term hospitalization.
12081	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases.
12082	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He tested his patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to new drugs, then quantified the results.
12083	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This placed him at odds with the more impressionistic traditions of psychiatry, and more in tune with the biological approach favored by many European researchers.
12084	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in an interview Thursday.
12085	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was there at its inception as a scientific area of focused research."
12086	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd worked at a time when there was considerably less government and academic regulation, and when clinicians were able to experiment more freely with emerging drugs to find good uses for them.
12087	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and his contemporaries.
12088	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd contributed to more than 50 books and wrote more than 400 articles.
12089	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His "Ayd's Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology and the Neurosciences" is a standard reference.
12091	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In 1966, he established his own journal, the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
12092	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It changed its name last year to Psychopharm Review.
12093	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in higher doses were even more effective.
12094	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It emerged that the powerful antipsychotic drugs often had powerful side effects.
12095	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In an interview on Thursday, Dr. J. Raymond DePaulo, chairman of the psychiatry department at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, emphasized that Ayd was as aggressive in investigating the side effects of psychiatric drugs as he was in gauging their potential.
12096	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo said.
12097	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"This wasn't theoretical for him.
12099	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized mentally ill people being released without adequate support systems because of effective drugs.
12101	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to equally strict analysis.
12103	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist.
12105	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His residency in pediatrics was interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a veterans' hospital.
12106	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	A biography prepared by the alumni association of his medical school said Ayd treated a wide array of veterans.
12107	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Some were violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from cold.
12108	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Once a patient stuffed his clothes full of newspaper and set himself on fire.
12109	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd is quoted as saying in the biography.
12110	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He had burns on at least 20 percent of his body.
12111	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It fascinated me that he had no real sense of pain."
12113	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The drug saved some from what then seemed to be unavoidable lobotomies.
12114	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd went on to become chief of psychiatry at Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore from 1955 until 1962, then left to lecture in Europe.
12115	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	From 1962 to 1965, he lectured at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
12116	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He later worked at the Taylor Manor Hospital in Ellicott City, Md., and retired in 2003.
12117	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In addition to his daughter Loretta, of Hunt Valley, Md., Ayd is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Rita Anne Corasaniti

12127	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Authorities say he used an e-mail alias, Ed Guitterrez, to communicate with at least two teenage boys.
12128	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He gave one alcohol.
12131	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He offered at least one of the boys $200 in exchange for oral sex.
12132	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
12134	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He's being held in the Hillsborough County Jail.
12135	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal criminal complaint reveals more details about how authorities think Zimmerman victimized at least two teenagers and possibly more over several months' time.
12137	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	They say he took some of the photos on a Canon camera
12138	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	others were sent to Zimmerman by the teens on his cell phone.
12140	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	At a first appearance hearing in the Tampa federal courthouse Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Murphy-Davis argued that Zimmerman should not be released on bail, calling him a community danger.
12143	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	But Zimmerman's attorney, Brian Albritton of Tampa, asked Judge Mark A. Pizzo to delay a bond hearing.
12145	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	His parents have already put up their house as collateral for $120,000 bail after he was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Feb. 2, he said.
12147	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, formerly of Tallahassee, had been living with his parents in his hometown of Lakeland until he was picked up Monday on the federal charge.
12148	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The judge agreed with Zimmerman's attorney and scheduled the bond hearing for 1:30 p.m. today.
12149	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Federal marshals took custody of Zimmerman in the meantime, leading him out of the courtroom Monday evening in leg shackles.
12151	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, a former television journalist who earned $75,000 as a DCF spokesman, previously worked as a reporter at Bay News 9, KENS-TV in San Antonio and WMAZ-TV in Macon, Ga.
12152	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	DCF spokeswoman Erin Geraghty described Zimmerman's actions as "a betrayal of trust" and said the agency would continue to cooperate with the investigation.
12153	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	If convicted of the federal charge, Zimmerman could get a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 15 years.
12154	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He could get up to 120 years if convicted of the eight state charges.
12155	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal case will be prosecuted before the state case, Murphy-Davis said.
12156	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman has worked with the DCF since 2005, first as spokesman for the department's District 13, which includes Citrus and Hernando counties, and then as a spokesman in Tallahassee for the entire state agency.
12157	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	When authorities recently arrived at Zimmerman's Tallahassee home with a search warrant, they found a DCF computer technician, Michael Hernandez, in his driveway, the complaint states.
12158	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez told investigators that he had thrown Zimmerman's home computer in a Dumpster at Zimmerman's request.
12159	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Hernandez also told them two days earlier he had "wiped" and reformatted Zimmerman's laptop computer at his co-worker's request.
12160	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says Zimmerman admitted he was "involved in a pornography business."
12162	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The complaint says he also told investigators he knew the second victim, who was in foster care and was a runaway at one time, was 17 years old.
12166	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The explosion went off in the southern K4 neighbourhood as dozens of women supported by local NGOs gathered to sweep the area, leaving scenes of carnage in the street.

12176	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion but hardline Islamist groups have routinely targeted military convoys in the area with roadside bombs.
12178	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	Islamist insurgents have since waged a deadly guerrilla war against government targets, Ethiopian forces and African Union peacekeepers.

12180	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The Horn of Africa nation has been plagued by civil fighting and defied more than a dozen peace initiatives since the 1991 ouster of former president Mohamed Siad Barre led to chaos.
12181	AFP_ENG_20080803.0357.LDC2009T13	The United Nations sponsored a new peace initiative which led to the signing on June 9 in Djibouti of a truce agreement between the government and the main Islamist-dominated opposition movement.

12268	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad questioned the official version of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and defended the right to cast doubt on the Holocaust in a tense appearance Monday at Columbia University, whose president accused him of behaving like "a petty and cruel dictator."
12271	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
12272	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
12274	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
12275	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here."
12276	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully," Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians.
12277	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."
12278	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	During a question-and-answer session, Ahmadinejad appeared tense and unsmiling, in contrast to more relaxed interviews and appearances earlier in the day.
12279	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	In response to one audience, Ahmadinejad denied he was questioning the existence of the Holocaust: "Granted this happened, what does it have to do with the Palestinian people?"
12280	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But then he said he was defending the rights of European scholars, an apparent reference to a small number who have been prosecuted under national laws for denying or minimizing the Holocaust.

12282	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He reiterated his desire to visit ground zero to express sympathy with the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but then appeared to question whether al-Qaida was responsible.

12386	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"I have read reports in the newspaper that the authorities did not reply to the two aims of Mr. Gambari's mission," Nyan Win told AFP.
12387	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"One is to release political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the other is the dialogue between the government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, using an honorific to describe the pro-democracy leader.
12388	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"In conclusion, Mr. Gambari's visit resulted in no improvement and was a waste of time."
12389	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to a landslide election victory in 1990, but was never allowed to govern.
12390	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The military regime instead unveiled its own "road map" to democracy and after more than a decade of delays drafted a new constitution, which was approved in a referendum in May.
12391	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The junta says the charter will set the stage for elections in 2010, but the pro-democracy movement says the process simply enthrones the army's position in the nation it has ruled since 1962.
12392	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"We firmly believe that the way to bring about democracy peacefully is the seven-step road map," Information Minister Kyaw Hsan said in comments to Gambari published in the New Light of Myanmar on Sunday.
12393	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	He also told Gambari: "We have made all necessary arrangements for Your Excellency to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
12394	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Your Excellency also wished to meet with her and tried your best."
12395	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Gambari flew to Yangon last Monday hoping to revive talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the regime, but he was shunned by her and the junta's senior leadership, meeting only the prime minister, who holds little power.
12396	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	In a statement released late Saturday, the United Nations said only that Gambari held "open and extensive meetings" with Prime Minister Thein Sein.

12398	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	BEIJING 2007-11-28 13:41:50 UTC
12399	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	China's rise as a global trading power obligates it to drop barriers preventing foreign competition in its domestic market and contributing to its ballooning trade surplus, the European Union's top trade official said Wednesday.
12400	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in Beijing.
12401	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year.
12402	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The weakness of China's currency, the yuan, against the euro also makes exports to China more expensive.
12405	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The commissioner's remarks, while pointed and critical, did not contain any new proposals or mention any possible EU sanctions.
12406	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes it is necessary to deliver difficult messages on trade ... but they are always constructive," he said.
12407	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright piracy.
12408	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who spoke after Mandelson, tried to address some of those points, saying Beijing has put in measures to expand imports and stimulate domestic demand.
12409	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	He also said China was "sincere and ambitious" in its efforts in protecting intellectual property rights and was giving market forces more determination over the value of the yuan.
12411	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue in March, officials said.
12412	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Also in Beijing on Wednesday, the EU's top finance officials warned that the weak yuan and looming Chinese trade surplus threatened to spark a backlash in Europe.
12413	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It could have the result that a protectionist reaction could occur in Europe," said Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister.
12414	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia traveled to China for talks with Wen and other officials.
12415	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Discussions covered currency markets and other economic issues, although neither side indicated any breakthroughs.
12416	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, speaking as head of a committee of eurozone finance ministers known as the Eurogroup, said he and the other members were befuddled by the euro's continued strength against the yuan, even as the Chinese currency gains steadily against the dollar.
12417	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the euro," Juncker told reporters.
12418	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"We do think we have to correct this obvious imbalance," Juncker said.
12419	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is leading the EU delegation, met with a rising star of the Chinese political establishment.
12420	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Li Keqiang, 54, was recently promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee -- the nine-member body that is the apex of Chinese political power.
12422	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"China's relations with the EU date back to the early days of the European Community," Li said.
12423	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This relationship has a history of decades, and since 1975, this relationship has come a long way."
12424	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The group also met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who called the summit "an effective platform for cooperation and exchanges between the two sides."

12426	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	HARARE, Zimbabwe 2008-04-03 23:04:35 UTC
12427	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Intruders ransacked offices of the main opposition party and police detained foreign journalists Thursday in an ominous sign that President Robert Mugabe might turn to intimidation and violence in trying to stave off an electoral threat to his 28-year rule.
12429	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Five days after the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission still had not released results on the presidential election despite increasing international pressure, including from former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who recently mediated an end to Kenya's postelection violence.
12430	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition Movement for Democratic Change already asserted its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won the presidency outright, but said it was prepared to compete in any run-off.
12431	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The police raids came a day after official results showed Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower house.
12432	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission was slow on the 60 elected seats in the Senate, releasing the first returns late Thursday that gave five seats each to the opposition and ruling party.
12433	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai tried on Thursday to reassure security chiefs who vowed a week ago not to serve anyone but Mugabe, according to a source close to the opposition leader.
12434	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But an agreed meeting with seven generals was canceled when the officers said that they had been ordered not to attend and that they would be under surveillance, the source said.
12435	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The man, who requested anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity, gave The Associated Press a copy of a letter signed by Tsvangirai outlining "MDC guarantees to the uniformed forces of Zimbabwe."
12436	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was given to the generals earlier in the day, he said.
12437	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The letter promises generous retirement packages for those unwilling to serve an MDC government.
12438	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It also promises not to take back farms given to officers under Mugabe's land reform program, except in cases in which an officer got several farms or if land was being neglected.
12439	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was not clear who ordered the generals not to attend the meeting, but the fact that some senior officers apparently were willing to meet with Tsvangirai underlined reports of rifts within the highly politicized upper echelons of Zimbabwe's security forces.
12440	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to give security forces time to clamp down.
12441	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The law requires a run- off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in Harare said.
12442	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	A diplomat at the U.N. Security Council, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said if the run-off was put off the council might have to take up the issue.
12443	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti said hotel rooms used as offices by the opposition at a Harare hotel were ransacked by intruders he believed were either police or agents of the feared Central Intelligence Organization.
12444	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe has started a crackdown," Biti told The Associated Press.
12445	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"It is quite clear he has unleashed a war."
12446	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people ... including myself."
12447	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had canceled plans for a news conference.
12448	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai was arrested and severely beaten by police a year ago after a banned opposition rally.
12449	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	In a further signal of the government's hardening mood, heavily armed riot police surrounded and entered a Harare hotel housing foreign correspondents and took five away, lawyers said.
12450	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Bill Keller, executive editor of The New York Times, said Times correspondent Barry Bearak, a winner of a 2002 Pulitzer Prize, was among them.
12454	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	She said the other three were released.
12456	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign, the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
12457	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back to whites.
12458	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
12459	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and agricultural production has plunged.
12460	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain and other Western nations.
12461	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But Western sanctions involve only visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of his allies.
12462	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Independent election observers say their projections based on election results posted at a representative sample of local polling stations indicate Tsvangirai won the most votes in the presidential contest, but not enough to avoid a run-off.
12463	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old president.
12464	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and suppressing the opposition.
12465	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said Mugabe was ready for a run-off.
12466	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"President Mugabe is going to fight.
12467	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He is not going anywhere.
12470	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many meetings tomorrow," but declined details.
12472	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We need to see an official tally, see it soon and have assurances made that this is actually a correct counting of the votes," U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
12473	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, said the delay was dangerous and urged officials "to declare the election results faithfully and accurately."
12474	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president," Annan said.
12475	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"I urge them to do the right thing ... The election results should be released now."
12477	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition has charged Mugabe planned to rig the results, and Western election observers have accused him of stealing previous elections.
12478	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	According to official results, a total of 2,405,147 valid votes were cast in Saturday's parliamentary contests, supporting opposition charges that the voter roll of 5.9 million names had been hugely inflated with dead and fictitious people.

12483	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	A trial has begun in the case of a baseball player-turned-actor accused of brutally killing a cat in a jealous rage after complaining that his ex-girlfriend cared more for the feline than she did for him.
12484	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Assistant District Attorney Leila Kermani said the cat named Norman died with broken teeth, broken ribs, a broken leg, a torn tongue, massive internal injuries including bruised lungs and a bruised liver and a chest cavity filled with blood.
12485	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant, in a fit of anger and rage, beat a defenseless animal to death," Kermani told the jury in her opening remarks Wednesday.
12487	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Former New York Mets baseball minor leaguer Joseph Petcka, 37, is on trial on charges of aggravated cruelty to animals for killing Norman on March 27, 2007, after a night of heavy drinking.
12488	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He faces up to two years in prison if convicted.
12490	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"This was a tragic accident," Hochbaum said.
12493	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He said outside court he believes that was because of the publicity the case attracted and the urgings of cat fanciers.
12496	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said she went to bed to avoid him but he woke her around 3 a.m. by putting his knee in her ribs and complaining that Norman had attacked him.
12497	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Altobelli, a Sports Illustrated reporter, said she left the apartment after Petcka refused to calm down.
12498	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said Petcka had complained, "You love that cat more than you love me," but she had no idea Norman would be in danger.

12504	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	JERUSALEM 2007-03-11 18:42:23 UTC
12505	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Little progress was reported Sunday from the second summit meeting in a month between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
12506	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	A Palestinian participant called it "difficult."
12507	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders met for more than two hours at Olmert's Jerusalem residence and pledged to continue their contacts, prodded by U.S. officials to nurture their fledgling dialogue.
12508	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the only concrete result, an Israeli official said Olmert pledged to keep the vital Karni cargo crossing between Israel and Gaza open for longer hours to allow more goods to enter and exit the seaside territory.
12509	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Karni closed often, citing security threats.
12510	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Larger issues standing in the way of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians -- borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem -- were apparently not even seriously discussed at the summit.
12511	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert said in advance that the talks would be limited to humanitarian issues, reflecting his rejection of the current government headed by the violently anti- Israel Hamas.
12512	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert and Abbas walked into the residence together.
12513	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders, flanked by their aides, sat on opposite sides of a conference table as the talks began.
12514	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert smiled to TV cameras in the room as he exchanged pleasantries with Abbas.
12515	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Negotiator Mohammed Dahlan, who attended the meeting, called the summit "difficult."
12516	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	He said the Palestinians called on Olmert to fulfill his pledge to ease travel restrictions in the West Bank by removing roadblocks, and to release sick and elderly Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, but Olmert made no promises.
12518	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The official said Abbas hoped the soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, would be freed before the formation of a new Palestinian unity government consisting of Hamas and Abbas' more moderate Fatah movement.
12519	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The power-sharing deal between the two Palestinian rivals, reached last month in the Saudi holy city of Mecca, has cast a shadow on Mideast diplomacy because it does not meet international demands that any Palestinian government renounce violence, recognize Israel and commit to previous peace agreements.
12521	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Under the unity deal, the new government only agrees to "respect" past agreements, falling short of the international conditions.
12522	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Dahlan said the Palestinians told Olmert the unity government is an internal Palestinian matter, according to Dahlan's spokesman.
12523	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Sunday's meeting followed a Feb. 19 summit in Jerusalem that also ended with little progress.
12524	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who attended last month's meeting, had urged the sides to continue talking.
12525	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Abbas has argued the unity deal with Hamas is essential to end months of infighting.
12526	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in internal violence since last May, after Hamas defeated Fatah in legislative elections.

12528	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the most serious flare-up of fighting since the agreement, gunmen from Hamas and Fatah exchanged fire early Sunday in northern Gaza.

12531	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Ahead of Sunday's summit, Olmert announced he was ready to "treat seriously" a dormant Saudi initiative calling for a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Arab world in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
12532	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the past, Israel has rejected the plan's call for a full withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem.

12537	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
12538	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The former board chairman of the Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being convicted on five counts of corruption, including bribery.
12539	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Under a final ruling handed down on Tuesday by the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City, Jilin Province, Zhang Xiaoguang was found guilty of taking bribes, corruption, embezzlement of public funds, illegally seeking private interest on behalf of relatives, and possessing major assets for which he could not account, the Beijing News reported.
12540	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	In addition to his convictions, Zhang was also stripped of political rights for life and all his personal property was confiscated.
12541	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The five counts involved 50 million yuan, but there was no breakdown for each count.
12542	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	According to the newspaper, Zhang's case is believed to be connected with another incident in which Gao Shan, former head of a branch of the Bank of China (BOC) on Hesong Street in Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, allegedly siphoned 1 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to Canada.
12543	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite Gao, who fled after sending the funds to Canada in 2005, and another suspect, Li Dongzhe.
12544	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	They are currently under the surveillance of Canadian police.
12545	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's case was a complex one, the newspaper reported, as shown by the 36-page court verdict that ran to nearly 30,000 Chinese characters.
12546	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of misappropriating public funds.
12547	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd, a publicly listed company, said two days later in a public announcement that 293 million yuan of its funds were missing from the BOC's Hesong Street Branch.
12548	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterwards, Gao, chief of the branch, was discovered to have fled overseas.
12549	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's first trial commenced at the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City in September 2006.
12550	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	However, it was soon called off at the request of public prosecutors for further investigation, following the detention of Dong Fang, former general manager of Donggao Science and Technologies Oils Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Northeast Expressway, who reportedly gave Zhang 10 million yuan in bribes.
12551	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.
12552	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang pleaded innocent in the BOC case in a second trial held in January this year.

12555	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis tested positive for testosterone after winning stage 17 of the cycling classic last July but has challenged the handling of the sample and testing conditions at the French laboatory which processed the dope test.
12557	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at a request last December from USADA attorney Travis Tygart for more tests on "B" portions of cleared "A" samples from Labaratoire National Depistage de Dopage's (LNDD) laboratory at Chatenay-Malabry.
12558	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at the notion of retesting samples he considers tainted at the very center whose procedures he is challenging in an appeal of his doping positive to USADA.
12559	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	That hearing is set for May 14.
12560	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"They got it wrong the first time and they're trying to get it wrong again," Landis said in the statement.
12563	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"My message to USADA and the LNDD is this testing should have been done right the first time."
12564	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis argues his stage 17 positive came from a contaminated sample that LNDD continued to process in violation of World Anti- Doping Agency protocols.
12565	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I have not taken testosterone or any other performance enhancing substance," Landis said.
12566	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis has agreed not to race in France this season, giving him no chance to defend the crown that could be stripped from him if the positive dope test stands.
12567	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I'm 100 percent confident that if best practice in process and technology were applied to testing my sample back in July, I would be racing my bike this season," Landis said.
12568	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	While critics could argue that if Landis had nothing to hide, he has no reason to object to more testing of samples that were clear, Landis argues the re-test move would violate WADA and International Cycling Union rules.
12569	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's request for further analysis of "B" samples is in clear violation the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code and Union Cyclist International (UCI) rules and is unprecedented in athlete anti-doping cases," the statement said.
12570	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's illegal initiative would also cause the Landis team to expend unnecessary resources to halt a clearly prohibited activity - resources that have already been unduly and unfairly stretched by the ADA's unethical approach to their pursuit of unsubstantiated allegations against Landis."
12571	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis' legal team claims to have been denied full access to details of his results "and has no reason to believe that it would be provided with the results of any further tests", the statement said.
12572	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis attorney Maurice Suh expects it would not receive documentation from any proposed re-testing.
12573	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"Illegal re-testing of these cleared samples is designed to further injure Floyd by costing him and his team substantial time and money, more deeply invading his privacy and destroying evidence that may later on be valuable in his defense," Suh said.
12574	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA continues to dramatically demonstrate that they have no interest in providing Floyd with a fair and just outcome to this process."

12590	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The television station said Perez died an hour after the officers' taped exchange.
12591	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez had had a series of encounters with police in Bedford and neighboring Mount Kisco that night.
12592	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A Mount Kisco police officer has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in Perez's death.

12623	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The news comes as Chinese officials are facing growing questions about environmental and geological problems related to the dam project.
12626	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	It said "about 30 more people" were believed dead.
12627	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	"Rescuers said there were no signs of life on the bus," Xinhua reported.
12630	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	As yet, it is not certain what caused this particular landslide, but scientists and critics have been warning for years that the reservoir created by the Three Gorges Dam might further destabilize hillsides, causing landslides and possibly even earthquakes.
12631	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Officials countered that the design of the project accounted for such concerns.
12633	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At a September forum about the dam, Chinese officials and experts discussed issues like water pollution, sedimentation and landslides and warned of a future environmental "catastrophe" if measures were not taken.
12634	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, a vice mayor from the city of Chongqing said the shoreline of the reservoir had collapsed in 91 places as water levels continued to slowly rise.
12635	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	A day after the forum, Xinhua released a short article disclosing the official concerns.
12639	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Landslides had been a problem in the Three Gorges area before construction of the dam.

12745	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal audit of 18 beef slaughterhouses following the U.S.'s largest beef recall found humane handling violations in four of them, including one serious enough for the plant to be temporarily suspended.
12746	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the first attempt.
12747	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
12748	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	None of the plants was identified.
12749	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit, which covered slaughterhouses that supply beef to the National School Lunch Program and other federal food assistance programs, was requested by Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee.
12750	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on the beef recall Tuesday.
12751	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, the department recalled 143 million pounds of meat from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. in Chino, California, following an undercover video by the Humane Society of the United States that showed slaughterhouse workers abusing "downer" cattle -- those too sick or injured to stand.
12752	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use of electronic stunning prods

12754	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	and bunching up of cattle going into the stunning area.
12755	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for insufficient stunning.
12756	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter.
12757	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	While not a violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
12758	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The problems uncovered by the audit have been corrected, Schafer told Kohl at Tuesday's hearing.
12759	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added.
12760	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We have helped train our inspectors to observe while being unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
12761	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
12762	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	I am working with USDA to gather more information about these audits and to find ways to ensure that the problems being discovered do not continue."
12763	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer told reporters after the hearing that based on the audit's findings, he does not believe the problems at Westland/Hallmark were systemic.
12764	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"It seems to be confined, on a downer cow issue, to the Chino facility," he said.
12765	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"But our continuing investigation will give us the full answer to that."
12766	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, argued that the findings show there is a systemic problem.
12767	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.
12768	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said.
12769	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"This letter is not reassuring.
12770	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	This confirms there are major problems with the inspection program and inadequacies with the law."
12771	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, which represents packers and processors, said that with the exception of the suspended plant, the findings "suggest a high degree of compliance and now an even higher degree of federal oversight.
12772	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California video released in January truly was an anomaly."

12793	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Politically, it would have been easy for Yankees manager Joe Torre to defend Alex Rodriguez for distracting a Toronto fielder by shouting as he ran past him on the bases Wednesday night.
12794	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But with two days to think about it, Torre admonished Rodriguez on Friday.
12795	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"It's probably something he shouldn't have done," Torre said before the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox.

12801	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But you can't change it, unfortunately."
12802	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told Rodriguez on the field that he had made a bush league play, something more appropriate for a Little Leaguer, and repeated those assertions to reporters after the game.
12803	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Several other Blue Jays were furious at Rodriguez.
12805	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I can't say I blame them."
12806	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Torre, who gave a lukewarm defense of Rodriguez immediately after Wednesday's game, said he spoke with Rodriguez that night about the play.
12809	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Jackson, a special adviser who has spent considerable time around the clubhouse as the Yankees have struggled, said that Rodriguez was within his rights to distract Blue Jays third baseman Howie Clark from catching a pop-up.

12845	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Real Madrid midfielder Emerson has denied refusing to appear as a substitute during the Champions League match with Bayern Munich.

12865	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Now, the music's almost over.
12866	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts might squeeze out another decade, but in the scope of things, that's nearing the end.
12868	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From bowling alley music halls to stadiums of 40,000.
12870	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
12871	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It's all been part of a living museum.
12872	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts are an invaluable art form.
12873	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They're exhibitions of the masters, music as their medium, the stage their easel.
12874	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	If I could collect them like paintings, I would.
12877	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and, recently, my four tickets for Lou Reed.
12880	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	At the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach this summer, Stevie Nicks' first words were "Through good grace, you're here.
12881	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	When we get older, we learn to appreciate what we have more."
12882	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller closed his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other."
12883	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Most of them call for peace.
12884	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So, there is a sadness to the concerts this time around.
12885	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Time is no longer on their side.
12886	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Each tour now may be that band's last.
12887	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly done, approaching historical status.
12888	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My 18-year-old daughter discovered the recent Lou Reed concert in a local arts newspaper and insisted that we attend.
12889	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Last summer, we missed an outdoor concert by Don McLean, missed hearing "American Pie" live, beneath the stars.
12890	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	To this day, we're sorry.
12891	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	What if we never get another chance?
12892	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So my daughter's logic, rightly so, was that someday Mr. Reed won't be around to perform.
12893	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We both know that day will be sooner now, rather than later.
12895	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The clock is ticking, not only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
12897	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Our summer lined up with bands that may never tour again.
12898	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
12899	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Stevie Nicks.

12902	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band.
12903	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love, reached our ears.
12904	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My children heard a Beatle sing.
12905	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will not.
12906	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will never see Mr. Reed, alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking transformation.
12907	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will not watch Mike Love consider if everybody had an ocean, surfboards set on the stage, Mr. Love giving the peace sign.
12908	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will never see Mick Jagger insist he likes it, this thing called rock 'n' roll, as he struts past Keith Richards on a seven-story stage.
12909	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Liza Minnelli will never invite their children to "Come, hear the music play."
12910	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
12912	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no young Steven Tyler whose train will still be rolling in 30 years.
12913	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no John Fogerty penning scathing lyrics against the war.
12914	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no Freddie Mercury rocking out stadium anthems.
12915	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
12917	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music.
12919	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert takes another little piece of my heart with the final encore.
12920	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The imminence is palpable, of the exhibit closing, of the stage lights going dark.

12925	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	A cold front will drape over Taiwan for about three days beginning Monday, bringing showers to northern, northeastern and eastern Taiwan and causing temperatures in most parts of Taiwan to drop slightly, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted in a weather forecast Sunday.
12926	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	CWB meteorologists said that as a result of the cold air mass, the northern, northeastern and eastern regions of Taiwan, as well as the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu, will see slightly cooler weather in the next three days, with temperatures slipping to between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius.
12927	CNA_ENG_20070902.0006.LDC2009T13	Central and southern Taiwan are expected to experience afternoon thundershowers over the next three days, with temperatures ranging from 24 to 33 C.

12939	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	With an estimated 2,500 votes still outstanding and other election certification steps still to take place, Mark Begich, the Democratic mayor of Anchorage, had taken a lead by 3,724 votes out of more than 315,000 cast, and he declared victory.
12940	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States Senate," Begich said.
12941	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"It's been an incredible journey getting to this point, and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day.

12943	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Stevens did not immediately concede the race.
12945	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Begich's victory will end the career of the longest-serving Republican senator ever and a pivotal figure in the history of his state after it initially appeared he would triumph despite his criminal conviction just days before the election.
12947	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't wish what I going through on anyone, my worst enemy," Stevens said Tuesday morning in the Capitol.
12949	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Instead, Democrats dropped Lieberman from another panel, delivering a mild rebuke for his strong support of Sen. John McCain and other Republicans in this month's elections.
12951	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	House Democrats met to make Rep. Nancy Pelsoi of California their candidate for speaker and essentially kept their leadership intact as well, with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland remaining majority leader.

12959	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The formal resolution before the Democrats, considered in what was described as an emotional meeting in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol, also declared that the Democratic caucus "rejects and disapproves of Senator Lieberman's statements against Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign."
12961	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After the vote, he expressed some remorse for his campaign comments but noted the resolution did not chastise him directly for backing McCain, who returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to resume life as a senator.

12977	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision touched off attacks on the Democrats by liberal and progressive groups and on the Internet, where critics accused Democrats of weakness in their posture against Lieberman, who they have branded a traitor to Democrats.
12978	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But senators pointed to statements by the Obama campaign in support of Lieberman as justification for their decision.
12979	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"The Senate Democratic Caucus has decided that if President-elect Barack Obama can forgive, so can we," said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del.

13019	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh is eyeing to install its first nuclear power plant by 2015 to meet the country's mounting electricity demand, as the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) has responded positively to its installation plan.
13021	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh is planning to set up the country's first nuclear power plant having a generation capacity between 700 MW and 1,000 MW at Rooppur in the northwestern Pabna district, 125 km northwest of capital Dhaka.
13022	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Tapan Chowdhury said the IAEA, the global nuclear watchdog, also asked Bangladesh to send a delegation to expedite the process of installing a nuclear power plant with its assistance.
13023	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Bangladesh submitted the work plan to the IAEA last October, giving details on how the country planned to install the nuclear power plant at Rooppur and maintain safeguards with proper management of wastes.
13024	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	The IAEA was pleased with the government commitment for setting up the nuclear power plant, selection of the project site and assurance of utilizing the plant for peaceful purposes, a senior Power Division official said.

13026	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	The total investment required in setting up a nuclear plant is anywhere between 1.0 billion and 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, sources from the BAEC said.

13048	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	A handful of Diana fans gathered late Thursday at the Paris site where the princess's car crashed 10 years ago, almost hour for hour.
13049	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	The Alma tunnel, on the north bank of the River Seine, is a must- see spot for tourists who are drawn to the site where the 36 -year-old Diana crashed shortly after midnight on August 31, 1997.
13051	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	No official events are planned in Paris, but well-wishers have left dozens of bouquets and photo tributes at the foot of a sculpture of a giant golden flame above the tunnel, which has become an ad-hoc shrine since her death.
13052	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	And some wanted to be here near the very hour of the tragedy, which happened at 26 minutes past midnight (2226 GMT) -- to see the spot in the middle of the night, and to take photographs.
13053	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"It's a coincidence we are here in Paris on the anniversary of her death," said Anna Gould, 34, who came here from Devon with her husband Ken, 42, and their three daughters aged 13, nine and four.
13054	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"But I was eager to see the place and to show it to the girls.
13055	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Diana was really the people's princess, she did a lot of good, the old bunch at the palace just couldn't take it."
13056	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	"Diana was a lovely and generous princess, but Prince Charles and his mother the Queen were so nasty to her that she died heart- broken," she said.
13057	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	On the afternoon of August 30, 1997, Diana -- who was then divorced from Prince Charles, father of her sons -- flew into the French capital from Sardinia with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, 42.
13058	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	After several hours shopping, the couple dined at the exclusive Ritz hotel owned by Fayed's father, the Egyptian millionaire and Harrods magnate Mohamed Al Fayed.
13059	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	They left at around midnight in a car driven by the deputy head of security at the Ritz, Henri Paul, who was called back after an evening off duty to help smuggle the couple from the hotel unseen by the paparazzi posted outside.
13060	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Some paparazzi were taken in by the ploy, but others set out in pursuit of Paul's Mercedes, headed at high speed towards the Champs-Elysees avenue.
13061	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	At 26 minutes past midnight, after running a red light on the Place de la Concorde, the Mercedes went out of control at high speed and crashed into a support pillar in the Alma underpass.
13062	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	The driver was killed instantly, Dodi died as emergency services arrived and the princess was declared dead in a Paris hospital at 4:00 am.
13063	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	Despite many conspiracy theories, propagated by the likes of Al Fayed, French police insist Diana's death was a tragic accident.
13064	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	But at the site, a strange inscription looms, referring to Diana's sons William and Harry, and sending a chill down the spines of visitors: "Your sons will want to know, if they let them live..."

13074	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago, it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
13075	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
13076	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a brochure.
13077	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university's resortlike new dormitories also boast private karaoke rooms, an English garden with pink roses and a swimming pool.
13078	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot spring," Iwanaga, 21, said.
13079	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"They really wanted us to come here."
13080	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of higher education in Asia, but today its universities are scrambling to find new ways to attract students.
13082	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The rapid graying of Japan's population has already been felt in other parts of society, including the lower rungs of the nation's education system where hundreds of half-empty elementary and high schools have closed or been merged over the last two decades.
13084	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan's postwar baby boom started earlier than America's.
13085	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	As a result, according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers' children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to 1.3 million this year.
13087	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	This year, as a result, nearly a third of the nation's 707 public and private four-year universities cannot fill all of their openings, according to the Education Ministry and university groups.
13088	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Roughly half of college-age Japanese attend universities.
13089	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Only three universities have gone bankrupt for lack of students.
13090	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Three years ago, Hiroshima's Risshikan University became the first Japanese university to fail since World War II.
13091	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But the Education Ministry and university groups are busily writing guidelines to help them deal with a retrenchment that few developed nations have had to face.
13092	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We are entering an era of survival of the fittest," said Yasuhiko Nishii, an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, the national association of private schools, including universities.
13093	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We need to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting the education of their students."
13094	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of prospective students, such as foreigners and "silver students," retirees who study for fun.
13095	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	In March, Osaka University gave a doctorate in mathematics to a 71-year-old former engineer who entered graduate school after retiring.
13096	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	At Fukuoka University of Economics, in this city on Kyushu, a southern island, administrators responded to the plunge in applications with a $50 million project in 1999 to build lavish dormitories, in which all 700 rooms are singles -- a luxury on Japan's traditionally Spartan campuses -- and are wired for the Internet.
13098	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The school also created a "celebrity business" major to train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative pursuits like music, rather than the "salaryman" positions sought by their parents' generation.
13099	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The prospect of universities fighting to win students has prompted national hand-wringing about the future of Japanese higher education.
13100	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Since the founding in 1877 of the nation's first modern university, the University of Tokyo, Japanese universities and their grueling entrance exams have been the society's main mechanism for sorting its youth, tracking the brightest into top business and government jobs.
13101	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many fear that this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards to attract more students.
13102	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a four-year break before entering the work force, some administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish.
13103	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Atsushi Hamana, president of Kansai University of International Studies in Miki, Japan, says that schools are realizing that young people actually want to study to get the skills to compete in a globalizing economy.
13104	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities realize they actually have to educate their students," Hamana said.
13105	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Another promising change has been an opening of Japan's doors to more foreign students, whose numbers have increased in recent years, but are still far fewer than in America.
13106	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, founded in 2000 in Beppu, a southern city, could be the shape of things to come in Japan.
13107	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Almost half its 5,421 students are from overseas, mainly China and South Korea.
13108	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign, including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
13109	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Half of the classes are taught in English.
13111	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has been rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
13112	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	What Japanese universities are desperate to avoid is a fate like that of Hagi International University, one of the three universities to fail because of too few students.
13114	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But from the beginning, it failed to attract its annual capacity of 300 freshmen.
13115	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The campus became increasingly empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to just three in 2006, the school said.
13117	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Next, it hired a top professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
13118	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for bankruptcy in 2005.
13119	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We tried to find ways to attract new students," said Masanori Hatachi, the president of the university, which now has a new owner and a new name, Yamaguchi University of Human Welfare and Culture.
13123	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education," he said.
13126	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	Recent comments by the Senegal's President Abduolaye Wade and other senior politicians suggest they want to increase censorship, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Wednesday.
13128	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	"We urge the Senegalese authorities to respect the work of the media and allow the media regulatory body to do its job," it added.
13129	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	The group cited comments by Wade during a recent visit to the United States, when asked about the police beating of two journalists in Senegal following a football match in June.
13131	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	The group also mentioned a call by Air Transport Minister Farba Senghor for members of the ruling PDS party members to boycott pro-opposition media.

13136	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Inspired by Neil Young and Radiohead, Michael Moore will release his new film online and for free.
13137	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The film, "Slacker Uprising," follows Moore's 62-city tour during the 2004 election to rally young voters.
13139	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	An official announcement of the film is planned for Friday.
13141	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Instead, Moore opted for a symbol of gratitude to his fans as he approaches the 20th anniversary of his first film, 1989's "Roger &amp
13143	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate my 20th year of doing this," Moore said.
13144	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"And also help get out the vote for November.
13146	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The 97-minute long "Slacker Uprising" will be the first major film to be released in such a way.
13147	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Last December, "Jackass 2.5" was streamed online and for free, but that was only a collection of left over material from "Jackass 2."
13150	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore took notice when Radiohead last year released their seventh album, "In Rainbows," online with optional pricing.
13152	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	If history is any measure, "Slacker Uprising" could have made a decent sum in theaters.
13153	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	His last two films, "Sicko" ($24 million) and "Fahrenheit 9/11" ($119 million) are two of the three highest grossing documentaries ever.
13156	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The director's last film, "Sicko," leaked online and was downloaded illegally in large numbers.
13157	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	He says this download, offered by BlipTV, will be high-resolution and far better than "YouTube quality."
13160	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A DVD will be released Oct. 7.
13161	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore last week released a paperback book, "Mike's Election Guide 2008" and is currently working on a movie for theatrical release next year.
13162	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	That film is expected to examine America as an empire, but the director declined to discuss any details about it.
13165	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore readily acknowledges this a film for Democrats.
13166	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"This film, really isn't for anybody other than the choir," said Moore.
13167	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"But that's because I believe the choir needs a song to sing every now and then."

13181	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims concluded its claims and appeals process after a worldwide outreach campaign began in 1998 to ensure that insurance companies fulfilled their obligations.
13182	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Its review was able to match those survivors submitting claims with more than 70 European insurance companies and businesses.
13183	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	"I fully recognize that no amount of compensation can redress the suffering inflicted during the Holocaust," said Lawrence Eagleburger, who chaired the commission.
13184	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, the panel "has achieved its goal of bringing a small measure of justice to those who have been denied it for so long."

13199	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	POZNAN, Poland, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's far-reaching tree planting efforts in recent years have benefited its environment and economy significantly and should be recognized as one of the key tools to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the chairman of the non-governmental organization World Growth said Wednesday.
13200	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China's afforestation efforts have demonstrated that forestry expansion will effectively reduce global emissions and promote economic growth," Alan Oxley, also former chairman of the GATT Council, said in a written interview with Xinhua.
13201	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China should be commended, and an expanded sustainable forestry will both offset carbon emissions and produce development dividends," said Oxley, adding that China's efforts have largely been ignored at the climate talks in Poznan.
13202	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	According to a new report by World Growth, China pledged in 2006 to expand the country's forest area to 20 percent of total land by 2010, which would increase the size of China's total carbon sink by 50 million tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly enough to offset the emissions of the entire country of Sweden for a whole year.
13203	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China's approach to climate change is fully consistent with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which encourages attention to climate change adaptation.
13204	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China is seeking to improve energy efficiency to reduce emission rates and it is also expanding its forest sinks, which are tangible measures to reduce emission rates, Oxley said.
13205	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, given the need for China to continue to raise living standards and develop the economy, an overall increase in emissions for some time is yet inevitable," he added.
13206	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"This is understandable, China has also indicated that a key aim is to adapt to the impacts of climate change."
13207	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	.
13208	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	The UN technical advisor on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stated that expansion of sustainable forestry is the easiest and cheapest way to reduce emissions.
13209	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Yet it is still being ignored by negotiators in industrialized economies.

13212	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Japan's opposition said Monday the tide was turning against the ruling bloc after its candidate was voted mayor of Osaka in the first election under Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda.
13213	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition also said it was the wrong time to discuss key legislation that would enable Japan to resume its naval mission supporting the "war on terror," citing scandals which involve the defence ministry and the finance minister.
13214	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition-supported candidate ousted the incumbent backed by Fukuda's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's election in Japan's second city after a campaign that drew senior national lawmakers from both sides.
13215	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was proof that voters in Osaka did not approve of the Fukuda administration and the administration supported by the Liberal Democratic Party," said Yukio Hatoyama, secretary general of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan.
13216	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"This symbolises nationwide politics," he said.
13217	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition won one house of parliament in July in a voter backlash against a raft of scandals under then prime minister Shinzo Abe.
13218	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Abe, an outspoken conservative, abruptly quit after the opposition refused his calls to extend a naval mission supporting the US-led "war on terror" in Afghanistan.
13219	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda, a 71-year-old centrist political veteran, took over in late September.
13220	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	He is in the midst of a battle with the opposition to restart the naval deployment.
13221	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	In a weekend summit in Washington, Fukuda promised US President George W. Bush to work to resume the mission, which provided fuel and other support on the Indian Ocean to the US-led coalition.
13222	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda's government downplayed the significance of the Osaka election.
13223	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was unfortunate that the candidate supported by the Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito lost," chief government spokesman Nobutaka Machimura said, referring to the LDP's coalition partner.
13225	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	I don't think this will affect politics at the national level," he said.
13226	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	In the election, Kunio Hiramatsu, a former television newscaster supported by the opposition, defeated the LDP-backed incumbent Junichi Seki, who was first elected in 2003.
13227	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The election was nominally non-partisan.
13228	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The election offers good news for the opposition after a tough month in which its leader Ichiro Ozawa offered to resign and then retracted it in a feud over whether to join Fukuda in a grand coalition.
13229	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition has also gone on the offensive over a growing scandal in which the recently retired top bureaucrat at the defence ministry acknowledged that a military contractor treated him to gifts, dinner and more than 200 golf trips.
13230	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition, which controls the upper house, reiterated that it would probe the scandal before taking up a bill on the naval mission.
13231	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Fukuda wants the military legislation to pass during the current parliament session that ends on December 15, but secretary general Hatoyama said "they can't realise that wish."
13232	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"The ruling bloc may need to extend the current session again," he said.
13233	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"The collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and business is just being divulged in the defence ministry scandal.
13234	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Naturally, now is not the time to discuss the new anti-terror legislation," Hatoyama said.
13236	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Germany on Wednesday pledged half a billion euros (785 million dollars) to help defend threatened forests and called on others to join its effort as a UN conference on biodiversity engaged top gear.
13237	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country wanted to set down a "very clear marker" on attaining the UN's Millennium goal of braking biodiversity loss by 2010.
13238	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	"The federal government, between 2009 and 2012, will earmark an additional amount of 500 million euros," Merkel told the meeting.
13239	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	"We want to use this money in those areas where forests and other ecosystems are under threat and to find quick solutions for conserving them."
13240	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	From 2013, Germany will stump up half a billion dollars annually, she promised, but added, "obviously, Germany cannot shoulder this enormous global burden alone."
13241	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	The three-day "high-level" section of the conference is gathering 87 ministers, with the goal of crafting a new global deal on preserving Earth's wildlife.
13242	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Some 6,000 representatives from 191 countries attended the meeting, launched 11 days earlier.
13243	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Participants at the conference are hoping to establish a roadmap towards negotiating, by 2010, an "Access and Benefit Sharing" regulatory framework governing access to genetic resources and sharing the benefits from their use.

13251	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	EU raises 2008 eurozone inflation forecast to 3.2 pct from 2.6 pct
13252	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The European Commission sharply raised its 2008 inflation estimate for the eurozone to 3.2 percent while trimming back only slightly its growth forecast to 1.7 percent.In February, the European Union's executive arm had forecast that inflation in the 15 nations sharing the euro would reach 2.6 percent this year and that growth would be 1.8 percent.
13253	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While record oil and food prices were taking their toll on growth and inflation, financial market turmoil and a US slump were proving to be worse than previously expected, the commission said in its spring Economic Forecast.
13254	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	In the 27-nation European Union, the commission forecast inflation would reach 3.6 percent this year, instead of the 2.9 percent previously expected, but stuck to its estimate for 2.0 percent economic growth.
13255	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	"Economic growth is moderating in the EU and euro area and the current, imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
13256	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The commission predicted that consumer prices growth would peak in the second quarter and cool down over the remainder of the year and into 2009, bringing inflation in the eurozone down to 2.2 percent next year.
13257	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Driven ever higher by record commodities prices, 12-month eurozone inflation hit 3.6 percent in March, the highest since the 1999 launch of the shared currency and well above the European Central Bank's comfort level of just under 2.0 percent.
13258	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While oil prices flirt with records close to 120 dollars a barrel, the EU executive said futures contracts suggested food prices would rise 54 percent in the first half of 2008 before stabilising.
13259	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, not all was doom and gloom in the commission's report with regional economic powerhouse Germany expected to perform better than the last time Brussels made forecasts in February.
13261	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, forecasts for some of Europe's other big economies were pared down with the French economy estimated to grow 1.6 percent in 2008 instead of 1.7 percent, and Italian growth cut to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent previously.
13262	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead to 2009, the commission predicted that economic activity would pick up towards the end of the year to about 2.0 percent in the eurozone at an annualised rate.
13263	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, for the whole of 2009, it forecast eurozone growth would slow to 1.5 percent while activity in the overall EU economy would ease to 1.8 percent.

13265	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Political leaders, diplomats, military personnel and hundreds of civilians gathered Thursday in St Peter's church in Riga to bid farewell to two young Latvian soldiers killed in Iraq last week.
13266	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Latvian army privates Vitalijs Vasiljevs, 24, and Gints Bleija, 25, were killed by a roadside bomb near the central town of Al Diwaniyah on December 27, the first combat fatalities from the Baltic state since it sent soldiers to Iraq in 2003.
13267	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"They were the best of soldiers," the chaplain of the Latvian armed forces, Elmars Plavins, said during the funeral service for the two soldiers.
13269	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The two soldiers had carried out their duty "without grumbling or doubting", said Plavins.
13270	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Among the dignitaries attending the ceremony, Latvian President Vaira Vike- Freiberga stopped and bowed silently in front of the two coffins, and laid a wreath alongside many others composed of maroon-red and white flowers, the colours of the Latvian flag.
13271	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"The whole of Latvia is in mourning today," said Plavins.
13272	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The sobs of grieving friends and family of the fallen filled the historic church as the caskets of the two soldiers were carried down the aisle by a guard of honour.

13274	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The commander of the battalion the two soldiers belonged to said morale among Latvian troops who arrived in Iraq this week for a six-month tour of duty was high, in spite of the loss of their colleagues.
13275	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"We can never get used to these tragedies," Major Ilmars Lejins told AFP at the church in Riga's Old Town.
13276	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"Let us be grateful that three other soldiers survived the attack," he said, adding that the new deployment of soldiers was "ready to stand in for those who fell."
13277	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Three other Latvian soldiers were wounded when an improvised explosive device (IED) went off as their Hummer vehicle drove past last week, killing Vasiljevs and Bleija.
13278	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The vehicle was on its way back to the soldiers' base at Al Diwaniyah, southeast of Baghdad, the armed forces said in a statement.
13279	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The young soldiers were killed shortly before their six-month tour of duty in Iraq was due to end.
13280	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Vasiljevs was completing his second stint in Iraq.
13281	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers in Latvia, which is a staunch ally of the United States, voted three weeks ago to extend the mission of the Baltic state's troops in Iraq by one more year.

13309	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Relatives back home say Utah gunman Sulejman Talovic's early life in the Balkans was marked by war, poverty and upheaval: the family fled by foot from Serb forces when Talovic was just 4 years old, and his grandfather was killed by a Serb bomb.
13310	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Talovic was just a toddler when the war broke out in Bosnia in 1992.
13312	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"We were besieged and bombed day and night.
13313	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We couldn't stick our noses out of the house," recalled cousin Redzo Talovic, 59.
13315	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	That's how later the shelling killed 20 people in the village," Rezdo Talovic said.
13316	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sabira Talovic fled on foot with Sulejman, his three sisters and his grandfather, while her husband, Suljo, hid in the mountains with other men from the village, relatives said.
13317	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Many left the village, only a few made it," said Murat Avdic, 54, a friend of the family.
13318	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The mother and children, exhausted, desperate and hungry, made their way the to nearby enclave of Srebrenica -- also besieged, bombed and crowded with starving families like the Talovics.
13321	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	During the war, they shared the little food they had with others," said Sefko Talovic, 59, a distant relative.
13322	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"His father helped other injured people flee when the village fell although he himself was injured too," he said.
13323	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Later that year, Sabira Talovic and the four children were among the displaced rescued by the U.N.
13326	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"They were very poor, they had lost everything, but they were very nice and quiet people," Cerkic said, recalling the young Sulejman as "a good child, always with a smile on his face."
13327	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sulejman's father, meanwhile, narrowly survived the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Serb forces loyal to then-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
13328	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The massacre of civilians was Europe's worst since World War II.
13329	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The family finally reunited in Tuzla later that year when a peace agreement brought an end to the war.
13330	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	But the accord divided up the country, putting their native Talovici in the Serb-controlled half of the country -- and they did not dare return, relatives said.
13331	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They made their way to Zagreb, Croatia, where they obtained Croatian citizenship.

13359	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2008-05-19 12:20:50 UTC
13360	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	India and Pakistan will hold peace talks Tuesday for the first time since Islamabad shifted from military rule, but the instability of the new civilian government could prove a hurdle to even modest progress, analysts said.
13361	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Bombings last week in the historic Indian city of Jaipur that killed 61 people will also shadow the meeting.
13363	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Recent incidents in disputed Kashmir, including one Monday in which the Indian army said it lost a soldier due to firing from the Pakistani side, could also have an impact.
13366	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's new coalition government -- formed by parties that triumphed in February elections that dealt a heavy defeat to allies of President Pervez Musharraf -- says it wants to press on with the peace talks that Musharraf kickstarted in early 2004.
13367	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A breakthrough in the slow-moving dialogue appears unlikely -- not least because of a falling out within the coalition over how to restore judges fired last year by the former military strongman.
13368	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	That dispute has raised doubts over the government's survival.
13369	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"The new government is so fragile," said Moonis Ahmar, a Pakistani international affairs analyst.
13374	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	First top civil servants will hold talks, then the two foreign ministers.
13375	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	The Pakistan state news agency reported Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee was also likely meet a host of other top Pakistani figures -- underscoring confusion over who is now calling the shots in Islamabad.
13377	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Now "there is no focal point and the prime minister is just bogus," said Pakistani political analyst Talat Masood.
13378	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"He doesn't have the power and everyone is looking over the shoulder to Mr. Zardari or others to Nawaz Sharif."
13380	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Ashok Mehta, a strategic analyst in New Delhi, predicted little progress partly because India was uncertain if the new Pakistani government would continue Musharraf's policies.
13381	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Negotiators had reached a framework solution for Kashmir, but "India failed to capitalize due to lack of political will," Mehta said, adding that it's unclear if the same deal was still an option because officials in the new Pakistani government "don't want Musharraf's proposals on anything."
13382	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over Muslim-majority Kashmir, and Pakistan-based militant groups have been fighting there since 1989, seeking independence from predominantly Hindu India or a merger with Islamic Pakistan.
13383	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	On Monday, an Indian soldier died when an army post along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir came under fire from Pakistani territory, the Indian army said.
13384	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	It was the second alleged incident of firing across the frontier in the past week.
13385	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Pakistan's military spokesman could not immediately be reached Monday but he has denied the previous incident.
13386	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	Masood said the fact that talks are continuing is a good sign.
13387	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	He said it did not appear the Jaipur blasts would undermine them.
13388	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A previously unknown Islamic militant group calling itself the Indian Mujahedeen has claimed responsibility.
13391	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	"I don't think they necessarily want to build up tension," he said.

13399	XIN_ENG_20080826.0200.LDC2009T13	The Czech Republic considered the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states an "attack on Georgia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," the ministry said.

13409	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	At least one man was killed and 25 others were injured late Monday when a bomb exploded at a night market in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south, officials said.
13410	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The bomb was hidden in a motorcycle, parked in front of a shop in Pattani, one of three insurgency-torn southern provinces bordering Malaysia, Pattani Governor Thanu Uthairat said.
13411	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	"The explosion happened around 8:25 pm (1325 GMT) and most of the injured were shoppers," the governor said.
13412	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	A Pattani hospital official said at least one man was killed and 25 others wounded.
13413	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The market bombing capped a day of violence in Pattani, where police found the headless and burned body of a 30-year-old Buddhist man, along with the charred body of his 14-year-old nephew, on a road earlier in the day.
13416	AFP_ENG_20070430.0393.LDC2009T13	The military-backed government, which came to power after a September coup, has made peace-building efforts in a bid to rein in the insurgency, but violence has escalated over the past six months.
13417	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Boxing: Bradley headed for the big time after Witter defeat
13418	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Timothy Bradley has set his sights on becoming the king of the world's light- welterweights after capturing the WBC belt in shock split point decision win over Junior Witter.
13419	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	In his first professional fight outside of his native California, Bradley knocked Witter over in the sixth round and did enough to claim the World Boxing Council title by judges' decisions of 115-113 and 114-113 for, and 115-112 against.
13420	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It was a controlled, clever and calculated display from Bradley, who not only conceded home advantage but ten years to the more experienced Witter.
13421	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Englishman Witter looked on the verge of suffering his first stoppage defeat when Bradley caught him with a looping right.
13422	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I always knew I would get to Junior in the second half of the fight," Bradley told AFP.
13424	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"It’s a punch that I have worked on.
13426	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew I had to win it in the second half of the fight."
13427	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter, 34, sank to the canvas in his own corner to take a mandatory eight count and sensibly avoided any danger by back- pedalling for the rest of the sixth round.
13428	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter's early control of the fight dissipated and Bradley landed more blows as the English boxer struggled with his timing.
13429	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	At the end of the fight, Witter looked concerned as to the outcome and Bradley is now left in line for bigger pay days against the other world champions in the division -- Andreas Kotelnik (WBA), Paulie Malignaggi (IBF) and Ricardo Torres (WBO).
13430	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Bradley, 24, also claimed he is willing to grant Witter a rematch or face his British rival Ricky Hatton, who is still regarded as the division's best boxer despite currently not owning one of the four world title belts.
13431	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I love Ricky Hatton and I would love to fight him.
13432	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	If the fight took place in the USA and the money was right, I would fight Junior again too," he said.
13433	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter admitted he was not in the sort of form that had seen him knock out former WBA champion Vivian Harris in September, and blamed over-training for his poor performance.
13434	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"My timing and speed just wasn't there.
13435	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I always thought if I just turned up I would win, but I didn't turn up.
13436	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"Getting put down in the sixth cost me the fight, but I still thought I did enough to win the fight.
13437	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I was sloppy though and just couldn’t get my timing right.
13439	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It had nothing to do with making the weight, but I never felt great in the fight and it could be that I overtrained which was why I wasn't myself.

13512	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	At least 10 people have been killed and more than 40 injured in sectarian clashes started on Friday in a Pakistan tribal town, an official said on Saturday.
13513	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Army was called out and curfew imposed in the city of Parachinar, the capital of tribal Kurram Agency, some 290 km west of the capital, Islamabad after the clashes took place on Friday.
13514	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	"The army, back by the support of cobra helicopters, has now taken full control of the city and the firing has also been stopped," Local administrator Sahibzada Muhammad Anees told private Geo Television from Parachinar on phone.
13515	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Clashes started when a group of Shia people took out a procession in Parachinar and chanted slogans against the Sunnis days ago, according to the News Network International (NNI) news agency.
13516	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Anees said that two helicopters hit positions of both sides from where shots were being fired.
13517	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	He said that the army and paramilitary militia have started joint patrolling, adding that there would be no relaxation in curfew.
13519	XIN_ENG_20070407.0063.LDC2009T13	Fighting had also spread to adjoining areas of the city and both sides were used heavy weapons, and a delegation of tribal elders has been sent to the area to broker a ceasefire, according to NNI.

13522	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The pope could easily lose the respect his office deserves by the divisive decisions he has recently made.
13524	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	Save that such actions are tragic for the church and the world, they would be quickly dismissed in any rational consideration of the church catholic.

13527	NYT_ENG_20080221.0095.LDC2009T13	The pope approved a revision of a prayer for the Good Friday liturgy that asks God to enlighten the hearts of Jews "so that they may acknowledge Jesus Christ, the savior of all men."

13556	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Beyond broad economic concerns, worries about the financial sector intensified after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. began to notify about 3,200 employees globally that they have been lost their jobs as part of a broader plan to slash 10 percent of the investment bank's work force, a person familiar with the situation said.
13562	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Although the market expected Obama to win the election, as the session wore on investors were clearly worrying about the weakness of the economy and pondered what the Obama administration might do to help it.

13680	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's military rulers Sunday threatened to take "effective action" against pro-democracy supporters who have staged a rare string of anti-junta protests across the country over the last three weeks.
13682	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"They agitated through various means to instigate riots and unrest among the people.
13683	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The NLD conspired to create this situation to derail the national political process," it said.
13684	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government also blamed the party, which is headed by the detained Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, for inciting Buddhist monks in the central town of Pakokku to destroy the homes and shops of pro-junta militia leaders.
13685	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The monks also held about 20 government officials hostage for several hours on Thursday, in the most dramatic standoff with the regime since the protests broke out on August 19.
13686	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"Under these circumstances, the government will never tolerate such malicious acts and will take effective action against those committing such acts in accordance with the existing law," the statement said.
13687	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Normally such statements would be filtered through official media, sometimes several days later, but the three-page document dated Saturday was given directly to journalists on Sunday and reported immediately in the state press.
13688	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have been arrested over the protests, which were sparked by a massive hike in fuel prices last month.
13689	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government again defended the price hike in the statement Sunday, saying it was necessary because of high world oil prices that had made fuel subsidies unaffordable.

13712	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In an unusual undercover operation, Delgado posed as a pedestrian on a busy street while fellow officers waited for drivers to barrel past her in violation of a law that requires them yield at crosswalks, even if there is no stop sign.
13713	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Chicago this year joined a growing number of big cities and small towns that are sending officers into traffic to make motorists pay more attention to pedestrians.
13714	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"People, they don't care," said Delgado, whose bright pink baseball hat and orange blouse made her especially tough to miss.
13715	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It's 'Get out of my way.'
13716	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The whole mentality is 'Get out of my way.'"
13717	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	With Delgado's help, police stopped 78 vehicles in just two hours and told them they'd violated a law that's been on the books for years.
13718	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	That number easily could have been doubled, but officers stopped only drivers who kept moving after Delgado had walked four or five feet into the road.
13719	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	When they were pulled over, motorists offered all kinds of explanations: One saw the pedestrian in the crosswalk but hadn't heard about the law requiring him to stop.
13720	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Another knew about the law but didn't see the pedestrian.
13721	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,800 pedestrians were killed and 61,000 injured in 2006, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
13722	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago alone, 65 pedestrians have died annually in recent years.
13723	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The number of deaths has dropped, but there is concern those numbers could climb again as more vehicles hit the road, and the elderly population skyrockets.
13724	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"We're beginning to see a healthy desire of older folks to remain active and go out for their daily walks," said Doug Hecox, spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration.
13725	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"That, along with more cars ... is a recipe for danger."
13726	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Some communities already are seeing more walkers because of the slow economy.
13727	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"The way gas prices are, people are rediscovering their feet," said Pam Fischer, highway traffic safety director in New Jersey, which recently launched a "Cops in the Crosswalks" program.
13728	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the law, then sent relieved drivers on their way.
13729	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	But police understand that the only thing more effective than a lecture from a police officer is a lecture and a ticket.
13730	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"If there's really no threat of getting a ticket for it, you're not going to really pay attention," said officer Chuck Trendle, who was working with Delgado.
13731	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Essex County, New Jersey, authorities "tried the educational route for years," said Paul Loriquet, spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
13732	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"But until you hit somebody in the wallet, it doesn't stick."
13733	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The threat of a ticket seemed to work in Bellingham, Washington.
13734	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	After the city started a police-decoy program in 2002, the percentage of drivers who yielded to pedestrians rose at least 25 percent -- even at corners where tickets were not being issued.
13735	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In St. Petersburg, Florida, the results were even more impressive.
13736	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The percentage of motorists who yielded to pedestrians jumped from 2 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2007, after police began writing tickets, educating the public and installing flashing beacons.
13737	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Pedestrian crashes dropped 17 percent between 2005 and 2006.
13738	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It starts putting pedestrians on their radar," said Ron Van Houten, a Western Michigan University psychology professor who has studied pedestrian safety and trained officers around the nation, including Chicago.
13739	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Police say undercover pedestrians will focus attention on crosswalk safety the same way that giving tickets for seat belt violations convinced more people to buckle up in the 1980s.
13740	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"Eventually, people get it," Trendle said.

13743	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has lashed out again at Israel, saying that the Jewish state won't survive in any form.
13744	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the hard-line leader smirked at a former mantra of the Israeli right of a "Greater" Israel that would include occupied Palestinian territories.
13745	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	The idea has since been abandoned, with Israeli consensus now that there will be a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
13746	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad said that while "some say the idea of Greater Israel has expired, I say the idea of a Lesser Israel has expired, too."
13747	APW_ENG_20080918.0656.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad also repeated previous anti-Israel comments, calling the Holocaust by Nazi Germany a "fake" and saying Israel is perpetrating a holocaust on the Palestinian people.

13804	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	MOSCOW 2007-03-02 19:53:22 UTC
13805	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into vaccine trials by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline in Russia that were allegedly conducted on children without parents' permission.
13806	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	The Prosecutor General's office said in a statement dated Monday and posted on its Web site Friday that investigators began the probe at a hospital in Volgograd, about 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Moscow, after several children who received the vaccines fell ill and parents raised questions.
13807	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	More than 100 children between the ages of one and two were given the vaccines during the trails, which have since been halted, the statement said.
13808	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said the deputy director of the hospital had been paid US$50,000 (euro38,000) to participate in the trials and that such tests on minors were illegal in Russia.
13809	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	They also said parents had been told the vaccines were humanitarian aid.
13810	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	GlaxoSmithKline officials could not be immediately reached for comment, but Michael Crow, the head of GSK's Russian operations, told Dow Jones Newswires that the allegations were unsubstantiated and untrue.
13811	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	"All of our trials undergo rigorous scrutiny and this study had been fully authorized by all the necessary Russian agencies," he said.
13812	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Crow said the tests began in 2005 as part of a wider study of pediatric vaccines Varilrix, Priorix and Priorix Tetra on 5,700 children across Europe.
13813	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Of those, 1,000 were in Russia and 100 participated in the study in Volgograd, he said.

13824	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	A new hearing has been set for Tuesday, said Audah al-Bulaiwi.
13825	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The trial was supposed to begin on June 23, but a judge postponed it to Sunday because the documents the al-Bulaiwi family had presented were incomplete.

13862	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The ratings company lowered Argentina's foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings to 'B-' from 'B,' which translates into a heightened risk for those who want to put their capital in the country and an increasing probability of default for the South American country.
13863	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The company attributed the downgrade in part to last week's government proposal to nationalize private pension funds, which has greatly spooked investors, sending overall confidence in the local markets into a tailspin.

13870	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The outlook remains stable, however, since the government still has a "financing cushion," Beers said, including nearly $47 billion in federal reserves as of Oct. 17.
13871	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	He predicted the financial crisis would curtail demand, keeping commodity prices low and producing a sharp drop in Argentina's economic growth.

13881	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	"This rating cut reflects the increased uncertainty the Argentine economy is facing," said economist Carolina Schuff, an analyst with the Buenos Aires-based economic Web site abeceb.com, adding she was not surprised by the cut.
13882	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The international financial uncertainty facing Argentina has been exacerbated by domestic decisions like the government's recent proposal to grab private pension funds, she said.

13905	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunni Arabs who have joined the Awakening Councils "have betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people.
13913	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al- Qaida, he said.
13914	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In the audiotape, bin Laden denounced Abdul-Sattar Abu Risha, the former leader of the Anbar Awakening Council, who was killed in a September bombing claimed by al-Qaida.

13927	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing any tapes.
13928	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years.
13930	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In an October tape, bin Laden sought to patch up splits between Iraqi insurgent factions, urging them to unite with the Islamic State of Iraq -- the insurgent coalition led by al-Qaida.
13931	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	He took a conciliatory stance, chiding even al-Qaida's followers for being too "extremist" in their positions toward other insurgents.
13932	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec. 16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti- Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone cooperating with the Americans.

14042	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Germany selling porcelain murals from former communist parliament at auction
14043	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-04-27 14:52:12 UTC
14044	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	If owning a chunk of the Berlin Wall is not enough for die-hard fans of communist-era collectables, bids are now being taken for three grandiose murals from the former East German parliament.
14045	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Up for grabs are a brown-and-blue mosaic of two lovers from a wall of the former espresso bar inside the parliament, a flowery blue-and-white mosaic that decorated the ice cream parlor, and a gold-plated, tile-mural that used to adorn the palace's restaurant.
14046	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	The mosaics are both 33.5 square meters (361 square feet), while the tiled mural measures 17.5 square meters (188 square feet).
14047	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	All three pieces were made in 1975-76 by the well-known Meissen porcelain manufacturer and were specially ordered by the East German parliament.
14048	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	While most of the parliament's artwork was donated to museums after the German unification of 1990, Germany's agency that deals with unresolved property issues decided to sell the murals.
14049	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	On Friday, it posted pictures on its Web site and began accepting sealed bids starting at euro10,000 (US$13,600) each.
14052	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	"We're hoping that the murals will end up on the wall of a restaurant or a museum's cafe so that they will be visible for the public again," Ellen Haendler said.
14053	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	"It seems like there's quite a bit of interest, from German as well as international bidders."
14054	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	At the time the murals were installed, the agency said, the espresso bar mosaic was worth euro18,540 (US$25,207), the ice cream parlor's wall decoration was euro28,788 (US$39,140) and the restaurant mural was worth euro8,063 (US$10,962).
14055	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Written bids have to be delivered to the agency by May 25.
14056	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	After years of debate about the future of the iconic Palace of the Republic, the parliament building has been stripped down to its steel and concrete skeleton and will be razed by the end of 2008.
14058	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	To restore the area, the government, the city and private fundraisers plan to rebuild a version of a Prussian royal palace, which used to stand on the site, with space for museums and a luxury hotel.
14059	APW_ENG_20070427.1076.LDC2009T13	Damaged during World War II, that Prussian palace was dynamited in 1950 by the East German government in a move that some in the West viewed as more ideological than practical.

14063	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Football: Smith tells Gers to forget Euro heartbreak and complete treble
14064	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Walter Smith has urged his Rangers players to forget the disappointment of their UEFA Cup final defeat here on Wednesday and concentrate on completing the domestic treble that remains in their grasp.
14065	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers can add the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup titles to the League Cup they have already secured this season and Smith said his squad had to retain their focus for the remaining four matches of the campaign.
14066	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"We are disappointed to lose a final at the end of what has been a very long campaign for us," Smith said after seeing his side beaten 2-0 by Zenit St Petersburg, whose technical superiority finally yielded two goals in the final 20 minutes of Wednesday's final at the City of Manchester stadium.
14067	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"Obviously it will be difficult to judge how much the disappointment takes out of the players.
14069	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"If we win our next three games in the SPL and become champions we will be happy."
14070	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' cause was not helped by the refusal of SPL bosses to extend the season, which would have enabled Smith's men to avoid playing last weekend, as Zenit were able to do.
14071	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But Smith refused to blame the intense end-of-season schedule for his side's wilting at the end of what was their 64th match of a campaign that started in late July last year.
14074	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' hopes of securing a first European trophy in 36 years were crushed 18 minutes from time, when midfielder Igor Denisov combined smoothly with man-of- the-match Andrei Arshavin before slotting home for the Russian champions.
14075	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Konstantin Zyrianov added a close-range second in stoppage time to make sure Zenit emulated the achievement of 2005 winners CSKA Moscow and condemned the tens of thousands of Rangers supporters who had descended on Manchester to a miserable journey back to Scotland.
14076	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Arshavin, who is being tipped as a potential star of Euro 2008, was also involved in the build-up to the second goal and Smith acknowledged that a player of his guile was something Rangers lacked.
14077	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I think we have missed a little bit of that all through the year -- somebody who can do something a little bit different.
14078	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have a good work ethic in this team and it has taken them a long way but in a few games we have lacked someone to give us a little bit more creativity.
14080	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"So you have to give them credit for what they have achieved against a lot of good European sides."
14082	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I have no doubt that some players will go and then you have to start again.
14083	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	It is always the problem with success.
14085	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"It is not only Arshavin we have to keep.
14087	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have to try to keep this team together and add three or four players so that we can rotate.
14088	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	At the moment it is always the same 12 to 14 players who play but to go to the next level you need more than that."
14090	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith's men, who were showing signs of fatigue, were partly to blame for their own downfall having lost possession from their own throw on the left.
14091	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The ball was quickly worked forward by the Russians and Denisov played a deft one-two with Arshavin before sliding the ball past Neal Alexander and Zyrianov wrapped things up in stoppage time.

14095	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	New car sales in Europe fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, dragged down by a poor showing in western Europe despite strong performance further east, the European automobile association ACEA said Wednesday
14096	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	Registrations of new passenger cars in Europe -- comprising the EU members except Cyprus and Malta, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland -- totalled 1,442,518 in May, 1.6 percent down on the figures a year earlier.
14097	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	"New EU member states showed a constant upward trend (11.1 percent) while Western Europe deepened its loss (-2.4 percent)," the ACEA said in a statement.
14098	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	The German car market, the biggest in Europe, was particularly weak, with registrations, dropping 11.1 percent over the period and continuing a downward trend since a sales tax hike at the beginning of the year.
14099	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	The French and British markets were also down, by 2.8 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.
14100	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	However, the European Union's newest member states, mostly former communist countries in eastern Europe, continued their upward trend for the fifth month running, with Lithuania (57.1 percent), Slovakia (35.7 percent and Romania (29.8 percent) leading the way, despite considerable percentage falls in Hungary, Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, the Czech Republic.
14101	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	Among the major brands, Europe's leading carmaker VW Group saw sales ease 2.5 percent in May over one year while France's PSA Group, the second-biggest European carmaker, saw sales rise a healthy 2.8 percent.
14102	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	US carmakers Ford saw sales fall 1.1 percent, after a hike the previous month, while GM fared worse with an 8.9 percent fall in May following a 4.7 percent fall in April.
14103	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	Fiat's recovery after several lean years continued to gather steam as its sales surged 5.7 percent while the Renault group's sales continued to tumble, losing 8.4 percent.
14104	AFP_ENG_20070614.0078.LDC2009T13	Toyota's figures took a dip, falling 2.6 percent in May, while German luxury car maker DaimlerChrysler saw sales rise 2.0 percent and rival BMW saw an increase of 5.2 percent.

14106	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-10-04 02:48:25 UTC
14107	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered a Texas doctor and his wife on Friday not to distribute videotaped footage of Anna Nicole Smith's breast augmentation surgery in 1994.
14108	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The order settles alawsuit filed last year by Howard K. Stern, the executor of Smith's estate, who was trying to stop Dr. Gerald Johnson and his wife from distributing the tapes of the former Playboy Playmate and reality star who died last year.
14109	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff issued preliminary injunctions against the Johnsons more than a year ago before issuing his final decision.
14110	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern maintained that Smith never consented to the taping or to allowing the footage to be seen by Los Angeles memorabilia dealer Thomas Riccio, who got tapes from the Johnsons, according to court records.
14111	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Johnson has said he routinely records surgeries with the patient's permission and promises to keep the video confidential "during the patient's lifetime."
14113	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She was 39.
14114	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Riccio's daughter edited the footage into a five-minute tape, scored with music similar to the theme from the film "Jaws."
14115	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The Johnsons' Houston-based attorney, Gus Pappas, did not return a message seeking comment Friday.
14116	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Larry Birkhead, who fathered Smith's daughter, called the video "truly disgusting" in a sworn declaration issued last year.
14117	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	"It was clear that Anna Nicole was unconscious during the videotaping, and even more disturbing, the videotape focused on areas of her nude body that were unrelated to the location of the surgery," he said in the declaration.
14118	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern's attorney, Vivian Thoreen, said all the tapes have been accounted for under the judge's previous orders.
14119	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She said the other terms of the settlement are confidential.
14120	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Although the Johnsons live in Texas, the Los Angeles Superior Court still has jurisdiction because the physician allegedly tried to disseminate the tape in Los Angeles County, said attorney Bruce S. Ross, who also represents Stern.

14123	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	Residents reported seeing a burning plane crash in northern Mogadishu on Friday.
14124	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	One witness said it was a Ugandan military plane and that it was shot down.
14125	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	Details were unclear and officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
14126	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	"We saw a burning plane coming down," said Muse Sheik Osman, who lives in the north of the capital.
14127	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	Osman said he heard the sound of an anti-aircraft missile being fired shortly before the crash.
14128	APW_ENG_20070323.0969.LDC2009T13	Another witness who identified himself only as Mohamed said a Ugandan military aircraft was shot down, and that police were arresting people around the airport, searching for suspects.

14134	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Beyond the barbed wire and camouflaged hangars that once housed Soviet-made fighter jets, some see hope for a small airport and a brighter tomorrow.
14135	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But the future may hold a different twist -- and has many locals fearful of Russian retaliation.
14136	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The shuttered air base in northern Poland, which dates back to World War II, is a likely site for 10 interceptors for the U.S. missile defense program, a plan Washington says is necessary to counter potential attacks from so-called rogue states.
14137	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Poland's new government is sounding increasingly skeptical about the plan, arguing that it won't boost Polish security -- a sentiment echoed throughout the farm country near the Baltic Sea coast, where residents struggle to see any benefits at all.
14138	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
14139	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Let's tell the truth here, it's not aimed against Iran, or against Vietnam or whatever -- it's against Russia."
14140	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The U.S. has been wrestling with such perceptions of its plan to place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic since opening negotiations with the two countries early last year.
14141	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Washington says the system is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from emerging threats from so-called rogue states such as Iran.
14142	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its security.
14143	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Last year, Gen. Nikolai Solovtsov, head of Russia's missile forces, warned that Moscow could target future bases in Poland and the Czech Republic with Russian missiles.
14144	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Residents in Slupsk, a town of 100,000 just 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the road, are worried, despite assurances from Polish officials that the region will be the nation's safest if it hosts the base.
14145	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I don't like it
14146	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	if the base gets built, the Russians will fire at us for sure, so we will in fact be the most threatened," says Zenon Kuwalko, a 54-year-old engineer from Slupsk.
14147	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.
14148	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"We have not received any benefits from our cooperation with the Americans so far -- not one thing," says Leszek Pieniak, 48, who owns the Pod Kogutem restaurant near the base.
14149	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not in Poland -- nothing.
14150	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	We don't even have visas.
14151	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	I'll tell my grandchildren that maybe in 20 years they'll have a shot at visa-free travel to the U.S."
14152	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I'm against the base and that's it."
14153	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.
14154	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I think that only a civilian airport and the economic development of the region will allow us to overcome unemployment and in the long run create jobs," says Jan Junczyk, 48, a reserve captain in Poland's air force who once flew MiG 23s at the base.
14155	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense block off and isolate our region."
14156	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Mariusz Chmiel, the county manager for the Slupsk region, which includes Redzikowo, agrees that an airport would help stimulate business and tourism in the area and help cut an unemployment rate that he says hovers above 20 percent.
14158	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The Poles also met with local Vandenberg residents to discuss the base's impact on the community and possible growth opportunities.
14159	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says Chmiel.

14162	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera is giving up "The Ghosts."
14163	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting costs in the wake of the economic downturn, the Met is dropping next season's highly anticipated revival of John Corigliano's "The Ghosts of Versailles" that was to feature the company debut of Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.
14164	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Angela Gheorghiu and Thomas Hampson, who also were to appear, instead will sing in a less-costly revival of Verdi's "La Traviata," Met general manager Peter Gelb said Thursday.
14165	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"In looking at ways to economize, that was an unfortunate sacrifice," Gelb said in a telephone interview.
14166	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's a much more expensive revival than most."
14167	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said all eight new productions will proceed as planned, but that some revivals may be replaced with less expensive ones.
14168	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in March 2010.
14169	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting it will save more than $1 million.

14889	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)
14890	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon reiterated on Tuesday that the UN mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, will continue to operate in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244.
14891	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, UNMIK continues to operate on the understanding that resolution 1244 ( 1999) remains in force, unless the Security Council decides otherwise," Ban said in his latest report on the work of UNMIK to the Security Council.
14892	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The secretary-general said Kosovo's declaration of independence and subsequent events have posed significant challenges to UNMIK's ability to exercise its administrative authority in Kosovo.
14893	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant operational implications for UNMIK," he said.
14894	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Pending Security Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground in a manner consistent with the operational framework established under resolution 1244," he said.
14895	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."
14896	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	But he stressed that any violence, whether directed at UNMIK personnel or facilities or against members of any of Kosovo's communities, is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.
14897	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region.
14898	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	He concluded by saying that the UN's efforts in Kosovo are aimed at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo and the wider region remains stable, and that the safety and security of the population are preserved.
14899	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	Adopted in June 1999, resolution 1244 recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and puts the breakaway province under UN administration.
14900	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iran will use force to defend nuclear drive: Ahmadinejad
14901	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Friday that his country will use force against its "enemies" to defend its nuclear drive, state television reported.
14902	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"For them, subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts.
14903	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against Iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in," Ahmadinejad said.
14904	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"But the Iranian people will resist with force against the enemies," state television quoted him as saying.
14905	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The comments came as the United States on Friday set a weekend deadline for Iran to respond to an international offer to freeze its nuclear drive.
14906	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We want and we expect a response this weekend," US State Department acting spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said.
14907	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	But an EU diplomat said in Brussels that the European Union is in no rush for a response from Iran.
14908	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of anonymity after Washington set the deadline.
14909	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We're in no rush" to have a response "in the next 24 hours."
14910	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Thursday that there was no deadline and that his country had already replied.
14911	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iran on July 4 handed major powers what it said was its "constructive and creative" response to their offer presented by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in June aimed at persuading Tehran to halt sensitive nuclear work.
14912	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The package, drawn up by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany, offers Tehran technology and negotiations if it suspends uranium enrichment which the West fears could be used to make atomic weapons.

14915	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
14916	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It needs someone with the courage of Martin Luther.
14917	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
14918	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
14919	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But it was reinforced by Sept. 11, 2001, and in the years since, I've only become more convinced that it is critical to Islam's future.
14920	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
14921	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for many verses -- especially those having to do with relations between Islam and other religions -- to be reinterpreted in favor of a more modern Islam.
14922	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
14923	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for Muslims to question our leaders and their strict teachings, to reach our own understanding of the prophet's words and to call for a bold renewal of our faith as a faith of goodwill, of peace and of light.
14924	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
14925	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
14926	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
14927	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
14928	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
14929	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I prayed to God to give me the strength to overcome them.
14930	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I made a deal with Him: I would give up everything, devote myself to Him and live the way the prophet Muhammad and his companions had lived 1,400 years ago if He would rid me of my doubts.
14931	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
14932	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
14933	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Viewing modern education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as they had been taught 1,200 years ago.
14934	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
14935	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1991, I took part in firebombing video stores in Riyadh and a women's center in my home town of Buraidah, seeing them as symbols of sin in a society that was marching rapidly toward modernization.
14936	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
14937	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
14938	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he create it himself?
14939	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
14940	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	By the time I turned 26, much of the turmoil in me had abated, and I made my peace with God.
14941	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
14942	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I saw Islamic judges ignoring the marks of torture borne by my prison comrades.
14943	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I learned of Islamic teachers who molested their students.
14944	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
14945	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me.
14946	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	One, written by a Palestinian scholar, was about the struggle between those who deal pragmatically with the Koran and those who take it and the hadith literally.
14947	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The other was a book by a Moroccan philosopher about the formation of the Arab Muslim way of thinking.
14948	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The books inspired me to write an article for a Saudi newspaper arguing that Muslims have the right to question and criticize our religious leaders and not to take everything they tell us for granted.
14949	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically if our religion is to survive and thrive.
14950	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
14951	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some men in my mosque refused to greet me.
14952	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
14953	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
14954	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
14955	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
14956	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	After I wrote articles stressing our right as Muslims to question our Saudi clerics and their interpretations and to come up with our own, officials from the kingdom's powerful religious establishment complained, and I was banned from writing.
14957	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
14958	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
14959	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
14960	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
14961	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I tried to give a new interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims and Christians and Jews.
14962	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
14963	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
14964	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
14965	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
14966	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban my writing.
14967	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I became a favorite target on the Internet, where my writings were lambasted and labeled blasphemous.
14968	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
14969	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
14970	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt that He was moving me toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we pray to God from the heart.
14971	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
14972	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is great.''
14973	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
14974	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
14975	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
14976	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
14977	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
14978	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
14979	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring my infidelity.
14980	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of the verse of light.
14981	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15, I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time.
14982	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
14983	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
14984	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
14985	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
14986	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
14987	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I believe that others can find it, too.
14988	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But first we need a Reformation similar to the Protestant Reformation that Martin Luther led against the Roman Catholic Church.
14989	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
14990	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his everlasting paradise.
14991	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
14992	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	he shared it only with a small, trusted circle of students.
14993	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous uprising.
14994	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.

14997	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-10-23 22:08:50 UTC
14998	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	Scott McClellan, President George W. Bush's former press secretary, says he is backing Barack Obama for president.
14999	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	McClellan made the endorsement during a taping of Comedian D.L. Hughley's new show that is premiering on CNN this weekend.
15000	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	The former Bush administration official said he wanted to support the candidate that has the best chance for changing the way Washington works and getting things done.
15001	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	He's the second former Bush administration figure this week to publicly back Obama, following former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
15002	APW_ENG_20081023.1359.LDC2009T13	McClellan caused bitterness among his former co-workers with a tell-all book that criticized Bush.

15004	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	SINGAPORE 2007-06-14 04:55:46 UTC
15005	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Oil prices retreated slightly in Asian trading Thursday after a U.S. government report boosted prices by failing to alleviate concerns that refiners are still not producing enough gasoline to meet demand.
15006	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Light, sweet crude for July delivery dropped 8 cents to US$66.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange midmorning in Singapore.
15007	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The contract jumped 91 cents Wednesday to settle at US$66.26 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly snapshot showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles were unchanged last week and refinery utilization fell.
15008	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	"There were general expectations that gasoline inventories would continue to build ... but the market didn't see it," said Victor Shum, energy analyst with Purvin &amp
15009	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gertz in Singapore.
15010	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The price has stayed above US$66 a barrel, "a strong level -- and the strong pricing is supported by the tight U.S. gasoline supply situation," Shum said.
15011	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gasoline inventories were unchanged at 201.5 million barrels for the week ended June 8, the EIA report said.
15012	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Analysts had expected gas inventories to rise by 2 million barrels.
15013	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gas stockpiles are 6 percent lower than inventories in the same week a year ago.
15014	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Refinery utilization, which had been expected to grow by 0.8 percent, fell 0.4 percent to 89.2 percent, the second straight weekly decline.
15015	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Most analysts say refineries should be using 94 percent to 95 percent of their capacity at this time of year.
15016	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Crude oil inventories rose by 100,000 barrels last week, when analysts had expected a 400,000-barrel decline.
15017	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose 300,000 barrels a day, falling short of expectations for a 1.5 million barrel-per-day increase.
15018	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	U.S. refiners reported an unusually high number of outages this spring, crimping gasoline supplies.
15019	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Reports of outages continued on Wednesday, with Valero Energy Corp. saying it was shutting down a machine at its Ardmore, Okla., refinery for maintenance.
15020	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	"The gasoline supply in the U.S. looks to be a key factor driving the crude oil market.
15021	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	It's like the tail wagging the dog," Shum said.
15022	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Geopolitical factors also continue to provide a floor for oil prices, he said.
15023	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Tensions over Iran's atomic programme escalated following Tehran's recent reduction of cooperation with the U.N. atomic monitoring agency.
15024	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Calls for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output have also largely been ignored, with the cartel stressing that supplies are sufficient.
15025	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures lost 0.2 cent to US$1.9600 a gallon (3.8 liters) while natural gas prices gained 1.7 cents to US$7.625 per 1,000 cubic feet.

15027	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-10-26 07:09:54 UTC
15028	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	German train drivers ended a 30-hour strike Friday morning against commuter and regional services across the country but did not get closer to an end of the conflict with the national rail operator.
15029	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	The GDL union's strike, which started Thursday at 2 a.m. (0000GMT) and ended Friday at 8 a.m. (0600GMT), was the third such walkout -- the longest one yet -- in a pay dispute with railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG.
15030	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	GDL wants better working conditions and a significant pay rise for train drivers.
15031	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	More than 2,000 train drivers walked off their jobs, according to GDL, and only one out of every two trains ran in western Germany on Friday morning.
15032	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	The east was even worse-hit with only 10 percent of all regional trains running.
15033	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the union said the motivation among the striking train drivers was still very strong and that GDL would announce at a news conference later Friday further plans regarding strikes next week.
15034	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	"The willingness to strike is high and unbroken," Maik Brandenburger said.
15035	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	GDL hopes to pressure Deutsche Bahn into giving in to its demands of a cut in the working week by one hour to 40 hours and a pay increase of up to 31 percent for its members.
15036	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	It has rejected a 4.5 percent raise that Deutsche Bahn agreed to in talks with two other unions that represent railway workers.
15037	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bahn carries some 5 million passengers daily.

15039	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-01-30 18:29:42 UTC
15040	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Eiffel Tower's 20,000 flashing light bulbs will go dark for five minutes on Thursday evening, hours before scientists and officials publish a long-awaited report about global warming.
15041	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
15042	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a report laying out policy proposals for governments based on the latest research on global warming.
15043	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The top U.N. official for the environment asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday to convene an emergency summit of world leaders aimed at breaking a deadlock over cutting greenhouse gases.
15045	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"There's a lot of momentum that has being building," Nuttall said.
15046	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"We have a window of opportunity."
15047	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Nuttall said the summit could be held between July and December.
15048	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the conference's host.
15049	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries that marked previous reports.
15050	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report must be unanimously approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can challenge the scientists' wording.
15051	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"The government people determine how things are said, but we (the scientists) determine what is said," said Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the report and director of climate analysis at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.
15052	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
15053	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	One Russian participant said Tuesday that the discussions he observed were more procedural than political.
15054	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Another observer who has taken part in several such conferences, Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace, said, "So far we're running on timetable.
15055	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	But who knows, we've got two more days.
15056	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	If there's any panic, it will be Wednesday night when they realize they've only got a few hours left."
15057	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and sea levels this century.
15058	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report "won't change our scientific basis, but it will make our jobs easier," Steve Sawyer, of Greenpeace, said Tuesday.
15059	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"It is an important and powerful new tool in public debate and policy debate."
15060	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups have long urged governments and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power instead of greenhouse gas-emitting ones like coal and oil.
15061	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Greenhouse gases are considered a key culprit of rising global temperatures.

15104	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger vows investigation, suspends fishing in areas affected by SF Bay oil spill
15105	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO 2007-11-13 22:19:16 UTC
15107	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
15108	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State Association of Counties annual meeting.
15109	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Then on top of it, it takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
15110	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
15111	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
15112	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A Coast Guard places a skimming vessel at the scene within 80 minutes.
15113	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
15114	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
15115	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Believe me, we will ask the tough questions that need to be asked."
15117	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
15118	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000 gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
15119	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Schwarzenegger signed an executive order that will suspend commercial and sport fishing until Dec. 1, or until state health officials decide it is safe.
15120	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Governor's spokesman Jeff Macedo said the state Department of Fish and Game will determine which fishing areas will be affected by the order.
15121	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
15122	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
15123	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas will be closed to fishing.
15124	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood caught in areas impacted by the spill.
15125	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
15126	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
15127	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Rear Adm. Craig Bone, the top Coast Guard officer in California, said Monday that the owners and operators of the ship will unquestionably face civil penalties, and that criminal counts were a possibility.
15128	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
15129	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.
15130	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on problems involving management and communication between the officers on the ship's bridge at the time.
15131	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
15132	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Darrell Wilson, a representative for Regal Stone, said the company was eager to hear the results of the investigation.
15133	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.
15134	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We take our job of environmental stewardship very seriously."

15136	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's Islamist Taliban movement said Wednesday it had captured two French humanitarian workers who have been reported missing with three Afghans for nearly two days.
15137	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The group, travelling in southern Afghanistan, had been out of contact with their organisation, Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children), since early Tuesday, the French foreign ministry and Afghan government said earlier.
15138	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	"We have seized two foreigners and three Afghans -- two of them interpreters, one of them a driver -- on the road between Nimroz and Farah," said Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi.
15139	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	"They are in our custody now and our leadership will decide their fate."
15140	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	He said the foreigners were a French man and a French woman.
15141	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The Afghan interior ministry told AFP earlier the missing French nationals and Afghan driver, cook and guard had been travelling from the southwestern province of Nimroz northwards to Farah.
15142	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	An Italian journalist was last month kidnapped by the Taliban in Helmand province, which adjoins Nimroz, and released two weeks later after the government handed back five Taliban prisoners.
15143	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The extremists are still holding an Afghan reporter captured with Italian Daniele Mastrogiacomo on March 4.
15144	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	They beheaded a driver snatched at the same time.
15145	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah has threatened through the media to kill the Afghan unless the government releases two more Taliban prisoners.
15146	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	Some critics of the deal that freed Mastrogiacomo said his exchange for Taliban would encourage copycat kidnappings by militants as well as criminals.
15147	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The French foreign ministry said in Paris earlier Wednesday it had been informed by Terre d'Enfance that it had lost contact with the group on Tuesday and they had not reached their destination.
15148	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	"Police have launched a search and investigation," Afghan interior ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP.
15149	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The French embassy in Kabul said it had no comment.
15150	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	18 years on, Tiananmen overshadows Olympics: rights group
15151	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Almost 18 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a top rights group said Friday that the official Chinese government line on the crackdown was overshadowing next year's Beijing Olympic Games.
15152	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"China's total failure to account for the massacre of June 4, 1989 casts a pall on its efforts to project a new image and continues to spawn more abuses," New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
15153	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	The group accused Beijing of harassing survivors, their families and those who challenged what it called the official "whitewash" of events and said the Chinese government had failed to bring justice to the victims of the massacre.
15154	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining dissidents?"
15155	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	asked the watchdog's deputy Asia director Sophie Richardson.
15156	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"Beijing -- and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games -- will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," she said.
15157	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters were killed by military units when the government sent in the troops to end six weeks of pro-democracy protests.
15158	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	It remains one of the most sensitive political issues in China.
15159	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Human Rights Watch repeated its call for Beijing to overturn a decision labeling the incident a "counter-revolutionary rebellion" and to give fair and open trials to all those convicted over the protests.
15160	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	It also wants the Chinese government to issue a list of all those killed and called on Beijing to stop persecuting those who were demanding justice and to prosecute those responsible for the violence.
15161	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"In the 14 months leading up to the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Communist Party wants to be seen as a modern, sophisticated nation, one governed by the rule of law," Richardson said.
15162	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"But the image the world should not forget is that of a courageous individual facing down a column of tanks, as his fate and that of thousands of other protestors remain unresolved."
15163	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Beijing has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown, insisting that its handling of the protest was necessary to ensure China's economic growth and stability.

15169	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	YANGON, Sept. 3 (Xinhua)
15170	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Myanmar announced the complete end of its national convention here Monday, laying down all detailed basic principles for drafting a new state constitution.
15171	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here said this is the formal end of the first step of a seven-step roadmap to democracy.
15172	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a general election to produce parliament representatives and formation of a new democratic government in line with the government's seven-step roadmap.
15173	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
15174	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The country will adopt an executive system of President as head of state and empower a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union Parliament) which comprises Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) in legislation.
15175	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic system economically.
15176	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
15177	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
15178	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Besides, armed forces members are also to be nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and border affairs.
15179	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The defense services commander-in-chief will represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the right to take over and exercise state power in case of state emergency that could cause disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national sovereignty.
15180	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
15181	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	It will not allow foreign troops to be deployed in the country.
15182	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
15183	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
15184	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
15185	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	As a result, the national convention turned into a status of long adjournment from March 1996 to April 2004.
15186	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Aimed at realization of national reconciliation and pushing forward the process of democratization, the military government announced the seven-step roadmap in August 2003, which mainly include the reconvening of national convention, drafting of new state constitution, holding of national referendum on drafted constitution, sponsoring general election and formation of new civilian government.
15187	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
15188	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	However, citing the reason of military government's house arrest placed on the party's general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and its vice-chairman U Tin Oo, the NLD kept boycotting the convention until its end.
15189	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of the constitutional national convention but did not mention the duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the time table about when the national referendum on the drafted constitution will be held.
15190	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here commented that Myanmar's constitution-drafting process is still not finished yet and the public concern will naturally focus on the country people's decision on the drafted constitution in the upcoming national referendum.

15387	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
15388	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It wasn't about LeBron James this time.
15389	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The King carried his shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor).
15390	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it didn't matter because the Cavaliers ran away from the Celtics long before halftime.
15391	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the second.
15393	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Boston's no-show included taking only two free throws in the first half, which ended with the Cavaliers leading, 52-35.

15397	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland has the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier attitude.
15398	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers.
15399	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"I thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the game.

15405	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This makes the Green 6-0 at home and 0-4 on the road in this postseason.
15407	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This caliber of play is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or Hornets.
15409	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The questions will be asked again and again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.
15410	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Strange.
15411	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road this season.

15425	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to come out to a better start."
15426	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When Pierce was asked if he was worried, he said, "A little bit.
15427	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I'm disappointed.
15428	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be a lot more aggressive.

15431	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland's Ben Wallace recovered from his Game 2 vapors and made his first three shots as the Cavaliers bolted to a 22-8 lead.

15437	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics were hoping to avoid.
15440	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"And that's the thing that alarms me from Atlanta.
15441	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got a lot of the offensive rebounds.
15442	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But that's hustle.
15443	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We have to do better."
15444	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	There is cause for concern.
15445	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This is a little more than a home- road thing.
15446	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It feels like the Celtics are being exposed.
15447	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Pierce and Allen have not been the same players they were during the regular season.
15448	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Rondo looks lost.
15449	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The team that won 66 games hasn't demonstrated the fortitude of a champion.

15457	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang, who is likely to lose his job over SARS, ironically hit the headlines in the past by representing a more open line on AIDS.
15458	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang was removed Sunday as chief of the Communist Party branch for the Ministry of Health, state media said, in an indication that his days as minister may be numbered.
15459	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	According to analysts, stripping an official of his party position is usually the prelude to sacking him from his government job.
15460	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been put "under control".
15461	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Since then, several reports have emerged of a systematic cover-up of the extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, involving especially military hospitals in the capital.
15462	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's extensive background within military medicine.
15463	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
15464	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Until 1990 he served in various positions at the PLA's Second Medical University, before becoming deputy director of health at the PLA General Logistics Department until 1993.
15465	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After a series of positions outside the PLA, Zhang was appointed health minister in 1998, as a member of what was considered a more capable and active Cabinet under then-premier Zhu Rongji.
15466	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the spread of AIDS in China.
15467	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.

15469	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding -- even more than usual for an industry that's been anticipating its demise since the advent of television.

15488	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this?
15495	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In practice, I decide to save a buck.
15498	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon.
15500	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	But there were dozens of copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent, plus shipping.
15502	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three -- nor the author got a share.
15503	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The book looked good as new.

15527	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Still, she sounded a little taken aback at the going rate for her books.
15531	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If I had had to search for the book in a store, maybe I would never have found it.
15532	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"With the Internet, nothing is ever lost," Lesser said.
15533	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"That's the good news, and that's the bad news."

15536	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She didn't set out to subvert the publishing and bookselling world, she said.
15537	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Like most of us who sell online, Mash began because she had too many books and wanted to raise money to buy more.

15550	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	She had worked 800 hours of overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or 13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
15552	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Bird had logged so many hours.
15553	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And the labor lawyers?
15554	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her overtime pay.
15555	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about it anymore.
15556	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
15557	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says that unless you are an "exempt worker" you must be paid time and a half after a 40-hour workweek.
15558	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
15559	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Usually "exempt" is a relief, as in "exempt" from jury duty.
15560	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law.
15561	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets paid.
15562	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
15563	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services, professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low- level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.

15566	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
15567	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"All that's clear is that it clearly didn't work," said Robert Fox, the deputy director of Working America, founded four years ago by the AFL-CIO to address the needs of working families who do not belong to unions.
15568	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The most common question posted on the "Ask a Lawyer" section of the group's Web site, Fox said, is about overtime: "Who's eligible?
15569	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Who's exempt?
15570	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
15571	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Let's take those one at a time.
15572	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The "who's eligible, who's exempt?"
15573	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
15574	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
15575	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
15576	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at lunch.
15577	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk.
15578	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
15579	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
15580	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Or an e-mail message from a client?
15583	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"That counts as working time," said Mark Thierman, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Reno, Nev., "particularly if you don't feel you can turn around and say 'I'm on my lunch break and I'll get to it later.'
15584	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
15586	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"BlackBerry time is work time," said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices group of Fenwick &amp
15588	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	West, a law firm.
15589	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It absolutely counts."
15590	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
15591	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule.
15592	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And while the people most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too.
15596	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
15601	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"In a wireless world, nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
15602	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Put another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when they are working from when they are not.
15603	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
15605	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
15609	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The company paid a substantial settlement, "then went back to doing things the old way," he said.
15610	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?"'
15611	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Thierman recalled.
15612	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	He said the opponent answered, "They don't think they can go onto college campuses and tell people 'We pay hourly."'

15639	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	While in previous disasters survivors have been found after two weeks in the rubble, such experiences are considered miracles.
15640	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	But people are not giving up hope in Beichuan, where everywhere people head to the former apartments or offices of their loved ones in the chance of good news.
15641	AFP_ENG_20080516.0743.LDC2009T13	One woman cannot stop crying.

15671	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	ECHOES OF DR. KING IN FINANCE, POLITICS AND THE DAILY GRIND
15672	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
15673	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	The leader of one of America's most venerable civil rights groups kicked off his annual celebration of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in what might have once seemed an unlikely fashion: by ringing the opening bell Friday morning at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
15674	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Roy Innis, the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, clapped and cheered beside Dennis Bassford, the chief executive of Moneytree Inc., a chain of check-cashing stores, as the towering video screen outside Nasdaq's media center beamed the scene onto Times Square.
15675	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	At its dinner on Monday night in honor of King's birthday, the civil rights group plans to salute Bassford for providing access to credit for poor communities and spreading financial literacy.
15676	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Niger Innis, the group's national spokesman and Roy Innis' son, explained, "You want to have leverage in our society, the color is not black or white -- it's green."
15677	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	As the federal holiday approached, many New Yorkers, from Caribbean business leaders to labor organizers taking aim at Starbucks, found a resonance in King's birthday that was almost post-racial.
15678	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They talked about empowering the poor and the working class, and about identities more complex than just black and white.
15679	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Strikingly often in those discussions, they mentioned a name that they said had brought fresh meaning to the holiday: that of Sen. Barack Obama, the first black candidate widely seen as having a shot at the presidency.
15681	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean that the fight is over, but the battlefield certainly has changed."
15683	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"Dr. King had become very unpopular before his death, talking about things that black men did not have the right to talk about," George Hulse, aboard member of the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said over bagels Friday at the chamber's King breakfast.
15685	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They could not talk about international affairs.
15686	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They could not talk about world issues," said Hulse, vice president of external affairs for Healthfirst, an HMO.
15687	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Many of the people who had Obama on their minds as King's birthday celebration approached emphasized that they had not decided whether to vote for him.
15688	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	His main opponent, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, also enjoys support among civil rights leaders and blacks.
15689	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	And many of the organizations that commemorate the holiday are nonprofit groups that by law cannot endorse candidates.
15690	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Rather, Obama's name came up alongside King's as people declared that the civil rights leader was no longer a symbol only for blacks, or as they expressed hope that the two senators would resist temptations to focus the campaign on race and gender.
15692	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's so funny when someone tells the truth and they have to apologize for it," he said of Clinton.
15694	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	So it was a collaboration between King and the civil rights movement and LBJ."
15695	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Debra Lesane, who is helping the Caribbean business group plan seminars on banking and credit, said at the breakfast that if King were alive today, he would be deploring the subprime mortgage crisis, which has disproportionately affected minority homeowners.
15696	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Paraphrasing King, Bassford, the Moneytree executive, agreed.
15697	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not good enough to have all the rights to engage in all the areas of commerce, if you don't have the ability," he said at the Nasdaq ceremony.
15698	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"What good is it to be able to sit at the lunch counter if you don't have the money to buy a hamburger?"
15699	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Economic issues also were at the forefront for people who felt disconnected from the holiday.
15700	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	The Industrial Workers of the World has chosen the King holiday to protest against Starbucks for not providing holiday pay to its workers on that date.
15701	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	But some baristas said they had never heard of the campaign by the union, which is fighting to organize them.
15702	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's just a day like any other, like all holidays," said Fernando Heredia, 22, who often works holidays at the Starbucks at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.
15704	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	But he said he had come to connect King's message to issues of more immediacy for him, like immigrants' rights.
15705	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not just about African-Americans but about all minorities, how we're all treated," he said.
15706	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Nearby, Idris, 35, an immigrant from Ghana who declined to give his last name, said he could not take the holiday off because he is paid on commission for selling tour bus packages to passers- by.

15711	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue, 24, and his fiancee migrated from poor Shanxi province to coastal Fujian 14 months ago, dreaming of amassing a nest egg by working factory jobs.
15712	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But both were laid off last month, joining the swelling ranks of Chinese workers cut adrift by the crisis, and who now pose a looming stability problem for China's leaders.
15713	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We really don't know what to do.
15714	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We can't go home but there are fewer jobs here and they don't pay enough," said Xue, sitting dejectedly in a government jobs centre crowded with anxious unemployed workers.
15715	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue was let go by a machinery factory in this industrial town as foreign orders dried up.

15719	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	And experts warn the problem could spike as more of China's estimated 200 million rural migrant workers lose their jobs.
15720	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Layoffs had already been growing as Chinese manufacturers retooled in recent years for higher-value products, said Constance Thomas, the International Labour Organisation's China director.
15721	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the ILO expects "at least several million" new jobless due to the global crisis.
15722	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"That has to be any leader's greatest fear -- to have a large percentage of their population unemployed, without income, without security.
15723	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Clearly, measures have to be taken to ensure that doesn't happen," Thomas said.
15724	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	An estimated 30 million workers lost jobs from 1996-2004 as the government restructured state-owned companies, causing widespread protests and contributing to the masses of migrant workers today.
15725	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	This time, authorities have even less control over the process, said Willy Lam, a veteran China-watcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
15726	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"Last time, the government could slow down layoffs if needed.
15727	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But now global forces are at work.
15729	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The government this month announced a 586-billion-dollar package to counter the export pain with infrastructure and other projects that will create jobs.
15730	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The trouble has been most acute in southern Guangdong province, China's manufacturing heartland, where one-fifth of factories in major cities are expected to close by January alone, according to industry estimates.
15731	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Thousands of workers have gathered outside shuttered factories there, demanding unpaid wages, forcing local authorities to intervene.
15732	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the pain is now spreading up the coast to places such as Tongan.
15733	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Gao Fengxiang, 42, came from central China's Hunan province in February to a factory job here.
15734	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Three weeks ago he was laid off and his employer and government officials have denied him required unemployment and medical insurance, he said.

15737	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The shabby office is packed with jobless workers checking job advertisements offering 1,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan (about 175 to 370 dollars) -- about 50 percent less than earlier this year, Gao said.
15739	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We're abandoned," he said.
15740	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The ILO's Thomas said China was ramping up re-training programmes and addressing holes in the social safety net.
15741	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	She expects big infrastructure projects to absorb many workers soon.
15742	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But far more is needed, given the problem's scale, she said.
15743	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, many workers are giving up and heading home, according to statistics showing increased rail traffic from manufacturing regions.
15744	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Lam called that "disturbing".

15754	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	After playing with the U.S. Coast Guard band at Ellis Island during World War II, he toured with clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra.
15755	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Around that time, Frigo wrote "Detour Ahead" with Lou Carter and Herb Ellis, a song that became a jazz standard recorded by Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan, among others.
15756	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	He was in his late 60s or early 70s when he turned his attention to the violin, appearing twice on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson.

15763	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Rising food prices continue to threaten South Africa's household food security, the National Agricultural Marketing Council said on Thursday.
15764	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Senior economist Tema Nkgasha Pieter said although food prices had risen at a slower rate in January compared to December, from January 2007 to January 2008 the Consumer Price Index for Food was 13.4 percent.
15765	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The good news is that this is 0.1 percent lower than the CPI- Food reported in December 2007 that showed a year-on-year increase of 13.5 percent," he said.
15768	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Brown bread increased at 16.21 percent and white bread at 19.
15769	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	92 percent year-on-year.
15770	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The prices of a 5-kg bag of super and special maize meal increased by 22.29 percent and 28.00 percent respectively, year- on- year.
15771	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The price of diary products on average increased by about a third, and vegetable products by just over a third.
15772	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other food products.
15773	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events," said Pieter.
15774	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity prices would remain high but stable.
15775	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this situation however.
15777	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food was expected to decline.
15778	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Pieter said the steep rise in food prices could potentially decelerate.
15779	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure, favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and livestock markets.

15782	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	The dramatic resurfacing Friday of powerful cleric Muqtada al- Sadr appeared carefully staged to counter claims that his hold over Shiite Muslims is weakening and to reassert his position as political kingmaker.
15783	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed.
15784	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He also instructed his militia to refrain from confrontations with Iraqi security forces, saying they should ``resort to civilian means when they are attacked.''
15785	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials in Baghdad seemed surprised by al-Sadr's return, which comes at a key juncture in Iraq.
15786	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Officials in Iraq and Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
15787	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We hope that he would take the opportunity to play a productive role,'' said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.
15788	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Members of al-Sadr's al-Mahdi militia staged two major uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004.
15789	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back.
15790	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government
15791	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	a 3-month-old security plan has made few inroads against withering violence
15792	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	and speculation is rife about how much longer U.S.-led forces will remain actively engaged.
15793	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Talks scheduled for next week between U.S. and Iranian representatives add another element of uncertainty.
15794	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Sensing the weakness of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Iraqi leaders have been positioning themselves for his possible fall.
15796	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said.
15797	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``And Sadr is probably the biggest player in that because he has a large chunk of the vote, and he controls the street.''
15798	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
15799	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
15800	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
15801	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
15802	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last year, his followers were widely blamed for driving the sectarian killing that drove up the toll of Iraq's civil war.
15803	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
15804	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
15805	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
15806	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
15807	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Sheikh Salah Ubaisi, one of al-Sadr's close aides, said the cleric was trying to find a way to move the country forward.
15808	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Iraq is now facing a severe crisis in all aspects, politically, economically and security wise,'' he said.
15809	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We as a political movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
15810	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have said that al-Sadr fled to Iran ahead of the U.S. troop buildup that began Feb. 13.
15811	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Most of the cleric's followers insist he never left Iraq, though one official in his movement said Friday that the cleric had used the time out of the public eye to conduct a ``regional tour,'' which included a stop in Iran.
15812	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for the first time in more than four months.
15813	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
15814	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
15815	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice.
15816	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to Israel.
15817	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to America.
15818	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to the devils.''
15819	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his traditional black robes and turban.
15821	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr said he stood ready to defend Sunnis and Christians who have been targeted by extremists, even as he underlined his displeasure with proposals to re-integrate members of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arab regime into the government and civil service -- one of the benchmarks for continued U.S. support.

15827	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Congestion Pricing: Transportation Department's Plan to Cut Flight Delays Is a Short-Term Fix
15828	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
15829	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
15830	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
15831	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
15832	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	But this short-term fix is not enough.
15834	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
15835	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In announcing the policy, the Transportation Department noted that the number of arrival delays exceeding one hour there increased by 114 percent in the first 10 months of fiscal 2007.
15836	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
15837	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
15838	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
15839	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
15840	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
15842	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.
15843	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In slamming the department's proposal, Air Transport Association President James C. May made the good point that the plan "does nothing to fix the primary cause of delays: our nation's increasingly antiquated air traffic control system."
15844	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Federal Aviation Administration has been waiting for nearly a year for Congress to fund a state-of-the-art satellite navigation system that would allow pilots and controllers to use air space more efficiently.
15845	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	A dogfight among the various interests over how to pay for it is bogging things down.
15846	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It's time Congress resolved it.

15848	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky 2007-08-04 16:03:42 UTC
15849	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	A military jury heard arguments Saturday about whether a soldier who was to be sentenced to life in prison in the slayings of a 14 -year-old Iraqi girl and her family should be eligible for parole.
15850	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Jurors deliberated much of Friday evening before convicting Pfc. Jesse Spielman, 22, of conspiracy to commit rape, rape, housebreaking with intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder, despite testimony that cast doubt on his involvement.
15851	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman, of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, faces a mandatory life sentence, but the jury could allow him to become eligible for parole
15852	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He was charged in connection with the March 12, 2006, rape and slaying of Abeer Qassim al-Janabi and the killings of her family.
15853	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The attack took place in Mahmoudiya, a village about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Baghdad.
15855	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman had pleaded guilty on Monday to lesser charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, arson, wrongfully touching a corpse and drinking.
15856	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman's grandmother, Nancy Hess, collapsed outside the courtroom after the verdict was read and prosecutor Maj. William Fischbach ran to her side and called the emergency dispatcher.
15857	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Soldiers in Spielman's unit fanned the woman with napkins.
15858	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman's sister, Paige Gerlach, screamed: "I hate the government.
15859	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	You people put him (in Iraq) and now, this happened."
15860	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Defense attorneys left the courthouse immediately following the verdict and could not immediately be reached for comment.
15861	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors rested their case Thursday amid struggles to overcome a fellow soldier's recanting of a story that Spielman acted as a lookout during the attack last year.
15862	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spc. James Barker, who has admitted his own role in the assault, said in earlier testimony that he had allowed investigators to draft sworn statements for him that implicated Spielman in the crime.
15863	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker testified Wednesday that several portions of the document were untrue, including references to Spielman's role in the conspiracy to attack the family and his knowledge of plans to rape the girl.
15864	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	But another soldier convicted in the attack, Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, testified that Spielman stood guard as his fellow soldiers raped the girl.
15865	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Cortez said Spielman was within a few feet of the others as they held down the screaming girl but did nothing to stop them.
15866	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker, Cortez and another soldier, Pfc. Bryan L. Howard, pleaded guilty for their roles in the slayings and received sentences of five to 100 years under plea agreements with prosecutors.
15867	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Steven D. Green, who was discharged from the Army before being charged, faces a possible death sentence when he is tried in federal court in Kentucky.
15868	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include murder and sexual assault.
15869	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker and Cortez have given investigators conflicting statements about whether Spielman knew of the plan to rape the girl and was present when they discussed it over swigs from bottles of whiskey and gin mixed with energy drinks, according to testimony.
15870	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	During their courts-martial, Barker and Cortez testified they took turns raping the girl while Green shot and killed her mother, father and younger sister.
15871	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Green shot the girl in the head after raping her, they said.
15872	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The girl's body was set on fire with kerosene to destroy the evidence, according to previous testimony.

15883	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The family of Mohamed Mamduh Abdel Aziz, who had been arrested for theft, have filed a complaint against the police, claiming they tortured their son to death, the source said.
15884	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The boy died at Mansura hospital, where he was brought four days earlier after police released him.
15885	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The source said the boy had lost consciousness during his six days in police detention, apparently after being violently beaten.
15886	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said it has documented 567 cases of torture in police custody of which 167 resulted in death since 1993.
15887	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The report was based on individual testimonies, legal cases and medical and autopsy reports and included 26 cases of police torture recorded this year alone, which resulted in three deaths.
15888	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	According to London-based Amnesty International, torture in detention is systematic in Egypt and, in the majority of cases, the perpetrators are not brought to justice.

15894	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"The United States stands with the democratically elected government of Georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia be respected," Bush said sternly in Washington on Wednesday.
15895	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	One day after the Kremlin and its smaller neighbor agreed to a French-brokered cease-fire to end the dispute over two pro- Russian breakaway territories, the pact appeared fragile at best.
15896	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	An Associated Press reporter saw dozens of Russian trucks and armored vehicles leaving the city of Gori, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the separatist region of South Ossetia and home of a key highway that divides Georgia in two, and moving deeper into Georgia.
15897	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Soldiers waved at journalists and one jokingly shouted, "Come with us, beauty, we're going to Tbilisi."
15899	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgian officials said the Russians had looted and bombed Gori before they left.
15900	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Moscow denied the accusation, but it appeared to be on a technicality: A BBC reporter in Gori said Russian tanks were in the streets while their South Ossetian allies seized cars, looted homes and set houses on fire.
15901	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	As confusion reigned on the first day of the cease-fire agreement, Bush called a Rose Garden speech to express concern about reports the Russians were already breaking it.
15902	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he was sending U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice first to France and then to Tbilisi to reinforce U.S. efforts to "rally the world in defense of a free Georgia."
15903	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	For her part, Rice said: "This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a neighbor, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with it.

15909	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili conducted a blitz of interviews with news outlets at home and abroad and made a series of claims, some of which were disputed as inaccurate or exaggerated.
15910	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	He said on national television that the U.S. arrival of a military cargo plane with humanitarian aid "means that Georgia's ports and airports will be taken under the control of the U.S. Defense Department."
15911	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell stressed the United States had no plans to take over Georgian airports or seaports to deliver the aid.
15912	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have no designs on taking control of any Georgian facility."
15915	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russian news agencies quoted him saying the United States would have to choose "support for a virtual project" or "real partnership" on issues such as U.S.-Russian cooperation on Iran and other world tension spots.
15917	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"We just reacted because we didn't have any other option.

15922	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili criticized Western nations for failing to help Georgia, a U.S. ally that has been seeking NATO membership.
15923	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	"In a way," he said, "Russians are fighting a proxy war with the West through us."
15925	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	When Georgia cracked down on South Ossetia on Aug. 7, Russia sent its tanks and troops into the two regions and deeper into Georgia proper.
15926	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Georgia, bordering the Black Sea between Turkey and Russia, was ruled by Moscow for most of the two centuries preceding the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.
15927	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Abkhazia lies close to the heart of many Russians.
15929	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Russia has distributed passports to most people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and stationed peacekeepers there since the early 1990s.
15933	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	Another laughed that Georgians retreating from Abkhazia had received "American training in running away."
15934	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	The peace plan apparently would allow Georgian forces to return to the positions they held in South Ossetia and Abkhazia before Aug. 7 and clearly requires Russia to leave all parts of Georgia except South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
15939	APW_ENG_20080814.0003.LDC2009T13	About 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the camp, about 80 well- equipped Georgian soldiers were forming what appeared to be a new front line, armed with pistols, shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets and Kalashnikovs.

16000	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	A probe into alleged misappropriation of "special allowance fund" by four heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during their services in the government and Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng will soon conclude, the Supreme Prosecutors Office (SPO) said Friday.
16001	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	Chen Yun-nan, director of the SPO's Special Investigation Task Force, was responding to reports by the United Daily News that the unit's probe into use of the fund by the four DPP bigwigs -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP presidential candidate and former Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP vice presidential candidate and former Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman and former Premier Yu Shyi- kun -- are drawing to an end.
16002	CNA_ENG_20070921.0025.LDC2009T13	As Weng's term will expire at the end of the month, the probe is also expected to end soon, the daily said.

16023	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Verizon entered into competition with Comcast and Time Warner Cable through its FiOS fiber-optic network, which offers television services.

16033	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli- Palestinian peace negotiations.
16034	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli military raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
16035	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el-Sheik.
16036	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Olmert that Egypt "rejects and is indignant at the military operation."
16037	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but by serious endeavors toward peace," Mubarak added at his news conference with Olmert.
16038	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to arrest "terrorists who had killed Israelis."
16039	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual force in normally quiet Ramallah.
16040	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He said Israeli troops returned fire, but did not initiate it.
16041	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"Things developed in a way that could not have been predicted in advance," he said.
16042	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"If innocent people were hurt, this was not our intention."
16043	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it "proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake."
16044	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce with Israel to the West Bank.
16045	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	"The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace," Abbas said.
16046	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert and Mubarak said Egyptian efforts were continuing to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by Hamas militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian prisoners.
16047	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	There had been speculation that the two men might be able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is blocking more substantive discussions with Abbas.

16051	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	It was an unusual and emotional day for Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.
16053	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	Olmert defeated Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993.
16054	NYT_ENG_20070104.0284.LDC2009T13	He said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but "Teddy Kollek made it so."

16092	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	death toll at 200 so far
16094	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Rescuers dug through the muddy wreckage of collapsed clay houses in northwest Iraq on Wednesday, uncovering at least 200 bodies from suicide truck bombings the U.S. military blamed on al-Qaida.
16096	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Four suicide truck bombers struck nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, killing more people than any other concerted attack since Nov. 23, when 215 people were killed by mortar fire and five car bombs in Baghdad's Shiite Muslim enclave of Sadr City.
16097	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was most vicious attack yet against the Yazidis, an ancient religious community in the region.
16100	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	He said the casualty tolls were expected to rise.
16102	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	"We are expecting to reach the final death toll tomorrow or day after tomorrow as we are getting only pieces of bodies."
16103	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	U.S. military spokesman Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner said Wednesday that he believed the bombings were the work of al-Qaida.
16106	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The bombings came as extremists staged other bold attacks on Tuesday: leveling a key bridge outside Baghdad and abducting five officials from an Oil Ministry compound in the capital in a raid using gunmen dressed as security officers.
16107	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Nine U.S. soldiers also were reported killed, including five in a helicopter crash.
16108	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The carnage dealt a serious blow to U.S. efforts to pacify the country with just weeks to go before the top U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker are to deliver a pivotal report to the U.S. Congress amid a fierce debate over whether to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq.
16110	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Just last month, Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, the commander of U.S. forces in northern Iraq, said he proposed reducing American troop levels in Ninevah, where he said Iraqi army forces were operating nearly independently.
16111	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	At the time, he predicted the province would shift to Iraqi government control as early as this month.
16112	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was unclear whether that projection would hold, after Tuesday's staggering death tolls.
16113	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Arab League also issued condolences Wednesday, in a statement saying "the best way out of this circle of violence is to go ahead with steady steps toward national reconciliation."
16114	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials believe extremists are attempting to regroup across northern Iraq after being driven from strongholds in and around Baghdad, and commanders have warned they expected Sunni insurgents to step up attacks in a bid to upstage the report.
16115	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Yazidis comprise a primarily Kurdish religious sect with ancient roots, that worships an angel figure considered to be the devil by some Muslims and Christians.
16116	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Yazidis, who don't believe in hell or evil, deny that.
16117	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Islamic State in Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, distributed leaflets a week ago warning residents near the scene of Tuesday's bombings that an attack was imminent because Yazidis are "anti- Islamic."
16118	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The sect has been under fire since some members stoned a Yazidi teenager to death in April.

16120	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	A grainy video showing gruesome scenes of the woman's killing was later posted on Iraqi Web sites.
16121	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Its authenticity could not be independently verified, but recent attacks on Yazidis have been blamed on al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents seeking revenge.
16122	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	A curfew was in place Wednesday across towns west of Mosul, and U.S. and Iraqi forces were conducting house-to-house searches in response to the bombings, according to Iraqi police and Army officers who spoke on condition of anonymity out of security concerns.
16123	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Twenty suspects were arrested, they said.

16130	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	In the Iraqi capital, U.S. special forces and Iraqi soldiers detained three suspected al-Qaida in Iraq leaders and four Shiite militia suspects in separate raids Tuesday, the military said.
16131	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Another Shiite extremist accused of attacking U.S. forces was captured the same day in Najaf, a Shiite holy city 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad, it said in a statement.
16132	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Thousands of followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr took to the streets in Najaf in a peaceful protest against the detention.
16133	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Demonstrators shouted anti-American slogans and called for an end to what they called random raids and rights violations targeting the movement.
16134	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military issued another statement Wednesday putting the death toll in the Yazidi bombings at 60.
16135	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	But the Iraqi estimate was based on body counts from local hospitals and morgues to which U.S. officials had no access so the total was believed to be higher.
16136	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki issued a statement Wednesday blaming the bombings on "terrorism powers who seek to fuel sectarian strife and damage our people's national unity."

16154	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	a senior defense official said.
16155	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The issue is expected to come up this week at a meeting in Budapest of NATO defense ministers, including US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the officials said in a briefing on Gates's trip.
16156	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	General John Craddock, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR), feels "that it's a very natural thing to do, contingency planning, because that's something that a military alliance should be in the regular business of doing," the official said.
16157	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Article Five of NATO's charter guarantees that the alliance will come to the defense of any member who is attacked.
16158	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Craddock has been in discussion with UN Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer over whether he can proceed on his own or needs the backing of NATO's political decision making body, the North Atlantic Council.
16159	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The general is considering conducting a risk assessment first, followed by contingency planning, the official said.
16160	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The official said Craddock did not need permission to do contingency planning but had gone to Scheffer "just to get a sort of signal pulse on that."

16169	XIN_ENG_20080304.0396.LDC2009T13	The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), said in a statement that Raul Reyes, one of its top leaders, "died as he was trying to get in a meeting with President Sarkozy where progress would have been made in finding solutions to Ingrid Betancourt's situation."
16170	XIN_ENG_20080304.0396.LDC2009T13	FARC is seeking to reach a deal with the Colombian government on swapping some 40 high-value captives, including Betancourt, a French-Colombian citizen kidnapped in 2002 while campaigning for the presidency, with 500 imprisoned FARC members, including some extradited to the United States.
16172	XIN_ENG_20080304.0396.LDC2009T13	His death sparked a regional tension as Ecuador has accused Colombia's cross- border move of a violation of Ecuador's territorial sovereignty which was also condemned by Venezuela.

16181	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Rangers boss Walter Smith on Friday welcomed a UEFA decision to take no action against Barry Ferguson over an altercation with a Hapoel Tel Aviv player in the club's UEFA Cup defeat in Israel this week.
16182	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Gers captain Ferguson appeared to strike Hapoel's Tal Chen after being floored by Luciano De Bruno during the 2-1 first leg defeat on Wednesday, and afterwards Hapoel's coach Nir Levin called on UEFA to look at the incident.
16183	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	But European football's governing body have since confirmed to Rangers that they will not be taking the matter further, ensuring Ferguson will not be banned for the return leg at Ibrox next week.
16184	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	"Common sense has prevailed," said Smith.

16186	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	It was just a reaction from Barry and it was the Hapoel player who was responsible by poking his finger at Barry as he lay on the ground.

16190	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups lashed out at Myanmar's military leaders for evicting cyclone refugees from relief camps and forcing them back to their isolated, storm-shattered homes.
16191	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
16192	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a release Saturday that hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people had also been expelled from schools, monasteries and public buildings.
16193	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In Yangon, there were eyewitness reports of one eviction from a Christian church.
16194	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Another group, Refugees International, said authorities appear to be trying to get villagers back to their land to begin tending their fields and reviving agriculture.
16195	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.
16196	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Eight camps set up for homeless survivors in the Irrawaddy delta town of Bogalay were "totally empty" as the clear-out continued, said Teh Tai Ring of the United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- at a meeting of U.N. and private aid agency workers discussing water and sanitation issues.
16197	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing."
16198	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	After his statement was reported, UNICEF issued a statement saying the remarks referred to "unconfirmed reports by relief workers on the relocation of displaced people affected by" the May 2-3 storm.
16199	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said the information came from a relief worker who had just returned from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he recounted his findings earlier in the day.
16200	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Separately, at a church in Yangon, more than 400 cyclone victims from a delta township, Labutta, were evicted Friday following orders from authorities a day earlier.
16201	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"It was a scene of sadness, despair and pain," said a church official at the Yangon Karen Baptist Home Missions in Yangon, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisal.
16202	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.
16203	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They have no home to go back to."
16204	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young children and those with severe illnesses left the church in eleven trucks Friday morning.
16205	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The authorities told church workers that the victims would first be taken to a government camp in Myaung Mya -- a mostly undamaged town in the Irrawaddy delta -- but it was not immediately clear when they would be resettled in their villages.
16206	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid groups meanwhile said Myanmar's military government was hindering foreign assistance for victims of the cyclone, despite a promise to U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon to ease travel restrictions.
16207	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.
16208	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They said the International Red Cross was waiting for permission to send 30 foreign staffers into the delta.
16209	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	An estimated 2.4 million people remain homeless and hungry after the May 2-3 cyclone hit Myanmar, also known as Burma.

16211	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations and then they are forced to move."
16212	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	But others were being denied such aid because they had lost their government identity cards, he said.
16213	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it was time for "reconstruction."
16214	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Foreign aid experts disagree, arguing that many people are still in need of emergency assistance for food and shelter, as well as medical care.
16215	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid workers who have reached some of the remote villages say little remains that could sustain the former residents.
16216	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Houses are destroyed, livestock have perished and food stocks have virtually run out.
16217	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Medicines are nonexistent.
16218	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The forced evictions are part of government efforts to demonstrate that the emergency relief period is over and that the affected population is capable of rebuilding their lives without foreign assistance," Human Rights Watch said.

16227	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The eurozone economy is now on the brink of recession as the financial crisis is devastating the 15-nation bloc sharing the euro currency.
16228	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	For the first time, economic growth in the eurozone recorded a quarterly decrease in the three months from April to June this year, figures from the European Union (EU)'s statistics bureau Eurostat showed Wednesday.
16229	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	But things have been getting worse after the negative growth in the second quarter, mainly due to the escalating financial crisis, which suggests that there is little chance of the eurozone economy rebounding in the following months.
16230	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In technical terms, recession means negative growth in two consecutive quarters.
16231	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	As EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday, forecasts of a recession in Europe and the United States could become the "central scenario."
16232	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Forecasts for recessions on both sides of the Atlantic "run the risk of becoming the central scenario in the coming months," Almunia told a conference in Madrid, Spain.
16233	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The financial crisis, which originated in the United States, has deepened in Europe in recent weeks, with several European banks falling prey to the global credit crunch, prompting EU governments to save their banks by injecting large amounts of money or even nationalizing them.
16234	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Without any knowledge of which one would be the next victim, financial institutions in the eurozone have become extremely reluctant to lend to each other, resulting in a more serious credit crunch.
16235	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Despite furious efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject liquidity into the financial markets, no big turn was observed.
16236	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Economists fear that a prolonged money market freeze would have a significant impact on overall lending to businesses and individuals, undermining confidence and threatening the real economy.
16237	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Figures from the European Commission showed that economic confidence in the eurozone continued to fall in September, hitting the lowest level since November 2001, i.e. shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, while the business climate decreased significantly to values last observed in 2003.
16238	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Last month, Almunia warned that the financial crisis is hurting Europe's real economy.
16239	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"There can be no doubt that events in the financial sector are hurting the real economy," he told a European Parliament plenary session.
16240	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Almunia said the effects of the financial turmoil have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and the severe housing market corrections in some EU member states.
16241	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"This combination of shocks has impacted directly on economic activity via higher costs and negative wealth effects and indirectly via a sharp erosion of economic confidence," he said.
16242	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"The result has been a break on domestic demand at a time when external demand is fading," he added.
16243	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	With the threat of the financial crisis on one side, the eurozone economy also faced inflation which remained stubbornly high at 3.6 percent.
16245	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	High inflation erodes purchasing power of every family, dampening private consumption, a key driver behind eurozone economic growth.
16246	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Official figures showed that consumption expenditure, investment and exports, the three major economic engines in the eurozone, all cooled down in the second quarter, decreasing from the previous three months by 0.2, 1.0 and 0.2 percent respectively.
16247	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Among large members in the eurozone, Germany, France and Italy, which together make up two thirds of the eurozone gross domestic product, all reported a quarterly drop in the second quarter.
16249	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Analysts warned that with no sign of recovery, recession is just around the corner for the eurozone.
16251	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	At that time, it was stressed that risks to the growth outlook were on the downside.
16252	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Commission said the dramatic events in the financial markets in the last few weeks are reinforcing that view.
16253	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In an emergent bid to restore confidence and avoid an economic crash, the ECB abandoned its long-time hawkish policy of refusing to lower its interest rate and joined hands with the world's major central banks Wednesday by cutting its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage points.

16255	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Ever since Mary Todd Lincoln overshot the White House decorating budget by $6,700 (a third of her $20,000 appropriation), infuriating her husband and delighting a press corps that had already turned against her, the redecoration of the president's house has been a public relations minefield.
16256	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Some new administrations tiptoe through it unscathed
16257	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	others are less nimble, and bombs explode.
16258	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	"It's an old maxim that you can build a billion-dollar highway that's the biggest pork barrel in the world and no one will say anything," said William Seale, a White House historian, "but if you're in public office and you try and change your desk, you're going to end up on the front page.
16259	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	In presidential decor, one must remember the public eye is fixed on everything you do."
16260	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's transition team has not responded to inquiries about his interior design plans.
16262	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	For starters, they will have to pay for their own movers.
16263	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	And while Congress budgets $100,000 in household transition costs for every new administration, if the Obamas spend more than that -- and most first families do -- they will have to cover the expense of decorating their private quarters with private donations.
16264	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Decorating the White House is the first lady's job
16265	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	she presides over the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, a board of appointees that includes her decorator and the White House curator, as well as art historians, furniture and decorative art experts and other advisers on historic preservation.
16266	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	Renovations of the public rooms, additions to the formidable collections of art and furniture, and any restoration work is overseen by the committee and financed by the White House Endowment Fund, which now has assets of about $27 million.
16267	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	When it comes to the private quarters, on the second and third floors, and the Oval Office, though, the decor is the "personal decision of the first family," said Tom Savage, director of museum affairs at Winterthur in Delaware and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House during the Clinton administration.
16268	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	"But there are so many safeguards.
16269	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	The misconception of the public is that a first family can make very dramatic changes, and that's just not so."

16277	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Members of Kenya's dominant Kikuyu tribe living in opposition strongholds feel they are paying the price for the tribal rhetoric that plagued last month's disputed elections.
16278	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's inhuman to ask somebody like me to go back to my 'real home land', I don't even know my real home land," said Nancy, a Kikuyu woman from the Eldoret area in western Kenya.
16279	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	The Kikuyus are the country's largest tribe but in a minority in western Kenya, where people overwhelmingly voted in the December 27 presidential election for opposition leader Raila Odinga, from the Luo tribe, who lost to incumbent President Kwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu.
16280	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Nancy, 47, said she had no intention of leaving the area where her family has lived for more than three generations to move to the Kikuyu heartland, in central Kenya.
16281	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"I'm not going anywhere, I was born here.
16282	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	My family came in the 1930s, they bought a piece of land, I have no relatives anywhere else," she explained.
16283	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	When Kibaki was declared the winner of the election on December 30 despite mounting evidence of fraud, several tribes turned against the Kikuyus.
16284	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Dozens were speared and hacked to death in raids on villages in the Eldoret area.
16285	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Refugees were also targeted, notably when a church in Eldoret housing displaced Kikuyu families was deliberately set on fire, killing at least 35 people.
16286	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Local residents and observers have argued that in regions where feelings of marginalisation were strongest, tribal vindication was encouraged by campaigns using the long obsolete term of "majimbo".
16287	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Majimbo -- a Kiswahili term which implies a form of federalism, decentralisation and devolution -- featured in Odinga's campaign, although it was never clearly defined.
16288	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Most of the attacks against Kikuyus in the Eldoret area were carried out by Kalenjin, one of the dominant tribes in the area, who squarely supported Odinga and are represented in parliament by his right-hand man William Ruto.
16291	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"They did not understand that the term majimbo means sharing of resources and power, brought to people on the ground," he said.
16292	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"According to them, it's cleaning and removing tribes from Kalenjin ancestral land," Stephen added, quivering because of the cold.
16294	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of Eldoret's Kikuyus settled the fertile region after the 1963 independence, with the support of their leader and the country's first president Jomo Kenyatta.
16295	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	John, 44, who lives with 10,200 other people displaced by the violence in a tented camp in Eldoret, only two miles from his home, said the opposition politicians had a slogan: 'Kalenjins, with no other tribes remaining'.
16296	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's not what they told the media, which was 'equal distribution of national ressources'," added John, a nurse.
16297	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	But Reverend Maritim arap Rirei, from Eldoret's Anglican church, said that the ethnic dimension of the conflict only surfaced on the back of deeper underlying problems.
16298	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"We have been having a potential conflict for several years, just waiting for a spark," he said, adding: "In Kenya, we confuse calm and peace."
16299	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"Kikuyus are seen as the privileged in terms of access to resources and protection of the governement, and when there are problems, they become an easy target," he explained.

16301	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	South African lawmakers rubberstamped President Thabo Mbeki's resignation Tuesday, as he attempts to mend his bruised reputation from charges he interfered in the prosecution of rival Jacob Zuma.
16302	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ANC-dominated parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of effecting Mbeki's resignation from Thursday, September 25, with only 10 votes against the motion.

16305	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he says cost him his job as president.
16307	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, 66, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in June 1999, becomes the country's first democratically elected president to be forced out of office before the end of his term.
16308	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter," said Mbeki in his application.
16309	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified," he added.
16313	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I am not convinced that the applicant (Zuma) was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution," said Nicholson.
16314	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	He was ruling on an application by the state to strike out sections of an affidavit filed by Zuma's legal team that insinuated political interference in the decision to charge him.
16315	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki had been increasingly at loggerheads with his party, which split into two camps behind him and Zuma, after deciding to run for a third term as party president at a crunch ANC conference in December last year.
16316	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Zuma toppled him as chief at the conference, and is the frontronner to be president after elections in April 2009.
16318	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	When announcing his resignation in a live address on Sunday, Mbeki denied he had " compromised the right of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide whom it should prosecute and not prosecute."
16319	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Following Mbeki's resignation, Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka, Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad, and Science Minister Mosibudi Mangena have also tendered their resignations.
16320	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	According to Fitch Ratings, Mbeki's resignation adds a level of political uncertainty to South Africa's economy already challenged on both international and domestic fronts.
16321	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interim president and his or her team will have to carefully manage the transition so as to not worsen already weak investor sentiment and add to macroeconomic risks," it said.
16322	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Motlanthe, who will take over from Thursday as president, is considered a key ANC strategist who has appealed to supporters of both Mbeki and the outgoing president's rival Jacob Zuma.
16323	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"Motlanthe will be the president, not interim, he will be the president of the republic until the election," spokesman for the ANC parliamentary caucus KK Khumalo told AFP.

16563	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	One of the highlights of the APEC Leaders' Week from Nov. 16-23 was the leaders' efforts to explore the social dimension of APEC, especially corporate social responsibility, amid the crisis.
16564	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"The crisis also highlights the need to develop more effective standards of corporate governance and risk management as well as the importance of social responsibility in the financial sector," the statement said.
16565	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders urged companies to incorporate social responsibility into their business strategies to take account of social, labor and environmental concerns.
16566	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	Such a move is likely to boost confidence among investors and consumers who have accused some companies of a reckless pursuit of profits, which triggered the financial meltdown, analysts say.
16567	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	However, it remains to be seen how companies across the world can promote the practice "on a voluntary basis" as stated in the Lima Declaration issued Sunday.
16568	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	More stringent measures need to be taken to prevent a repeat of the economic turmoil, critics say.
16569	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As APEC leaders largely refrained from digging into details of the pledged action before a new U.S. president takes office next January, world economies should remain strongly vigilant about the ongoing financial storm, which may get worse before it can get any better, analysts say.

16571	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	The French banking system is "healthy" and well able to avoid "chain-reaction failures," the French government spokesman Luc Chatel said on Wednesday.
16572	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"We have the good fortune in France of having a banking system which is healthy and averts these chain reactions," he said, reporting on a meeting of the government.
16573	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"It is the world financial system which is showing all its limits through this crisis."

16576	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"The responsibility of the government... is first to avert chain reactions and to protect customers," and "to lead talks between European partners... so that action is concerted," he said.
16577	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"It must be said clearly that this is a very big crisis, it is undoubtedly the first global financial crisis, it must not be under-estimated," said Chatel, who is also junior industry minister.
16578	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	"When some banking establishments or some credit establishments have committed mistakes, when they have been imprudent, it is not abnormal that one day they pay for the consequences," he said.
16579	AFP_ENG_20080917.0380.LDC2009T13	Earlier, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on French 24 television: "We are seeing a transformation of financial markets, of the role of people in finance and of bodies overseeing finance."

16588	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK - The word "courage" gets tossed around a lot in sports, often in reference to a player who makes an important shot or sinks a winning putt.
16589	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	We gained a new appreciation for the term when we visited the Sports Museum of America and read about Aja Frary.
16590	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	When she was 15, her stepfather tried to force her to give up sports.
16591	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Frary refused and left home, moving in with her grandparents.
16592	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	She went on to star in three sports at Seattle's Evergreen High and earned a college scholarship, eventually becoming one of the top track athletes in the country.
16594	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	His documenting of the inequity forced the school district to balance access to playing fields.
16595	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"You come away from a visit to the museum more impressed with the people you didn't know about than those you did know," said Jim Craig of Easton, goaltender for the 1980 US Olympic "Miracle on Ice" hockey team.
16596	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Craig, 51, an honorary trustee, helped usher the museum into its historic space in the Financial District two months ago.
16597	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	He also loaned the museum the flag that someone draped over him in the tumult after the US team captured the gold medal against the Soviets.
16598	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The resulting photo is one of sports' iconic images.
16599	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Certainly this museum is more than a repository of artifacts, although it can claim some dandies: college football's Heisman Trophy, for which it is the new permanent home

16607	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Some people would minimize sports' role in our culture," said Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder.
16608	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"But my goal, going back 6?
16609	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	years now, is to show the power of sports to impact lives."
16610	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb's life changed in a matter of 24 hours, when he visited the Basketball Hall of Fame for the first time on Sept. 10, 2001 (his 39th birthday), and lamented the absence of an all-sports museum in the United States.
16611	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The attacks the next day spurred him to pursue his goal of a museum that would celebrate all sports, and to build it in Manhattan.
16613	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb speaks warmly of the first athlete to join the advisory board, Celtics legend Bob Cousy.
16614	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We call Bob our patron saint," said Schwalb.
16615	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Cousy, a New York native, was also the subject of a rallying cry when the fledgling museum was trying to gain its footing.
16617	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We had four or five lined up, but as time went on the others kept canceling.
16620	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a dozen or so businesses out of some 300 applicants won approval, and that landed the museum $60 million of its required $100 million.
16623	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The 19 galleries brim with the top players in the leading sports.
16626	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	As in many sports stories, the statistics are telling.
16629	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	And a lot of them don't even know the Hall of Fame is in Springfield."
16631	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum is about 50 yards from the park, right across the street from the famous "charging bull" statue symbolic of Wall Street, a couple of blocks from Ground Zero, and at the starting point for ticker-tape parades down Broadway, the mile-long "Canyon of Heroes" leading to City Hall.
16632	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Dozens of sidewalk medallions commemorate the early parades, such as the salute to Charles Lindbergh in 1927, and Schwalb considers it great karma that the lone two markers for sports parades (golfer Bobby Jones and swimmer Gertrude Ederle) are both in front of the museum.
16634	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum sits at 26 Broadway and boasts a commanding presence in the historic former headquarters of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co.
16635	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The building is unlike any other we could find," said Schwalb.
16637	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The biggest win-win among sports organizations has to be the partnership with the Women's Sports Foundation, which was without a permanent home before it christened the Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center as part of the museum.
16638	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"They were determined to have a physical space for their hall of fame," said Schwalb.
16639	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"For 20 years they would have an induction dinner, and they never had a place to honor the inductees."
16640	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum provides several interactive touches: Fans can lend the announcer's voice to some classic moments, get behind a hockey goalie's mask and see a forward bearing down on them with the puck, gauge their cycling ability, even take a shot at changing the tires like a member of a pit crew.
16641	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	At the final kiosk, visitors can learn more about how to visit the various halls of fame and get on their e-mail lists.
16642	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's better than a single hall of fame and more than a museum," said Craig.

16664	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Early Clash Brewing Over Iraq Report
16666	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senior congressional aides said Wednesday that the White House has proposed limiting the much-anticipated appearance on Capitol Hill next month of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker to a private congressional briefing, suggesting instead that the Bush administration's progress report on the Iraq war should be delivered to Congress by the secretaries of state and defense.
16667	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials did not deny making the proposal in informal talks with Congress, but they said Wednesday that they will not shield the commanding general in Iraq and the senior U.S. diplomat there from public congressional testimony required by the war-funding legislation President Bush signed in May.
16670	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before Congress.
16672	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
16674	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del., told the White House that Bush's presentation plan was unacceptable.
16675	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said that ``we are in talks with the administration and ... Senator Levin wants an open hearing'' with Petraeus.
16676	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
16679	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``That's all the more reason why they would need to testify,'' a senior Foreign Relations Committee aide said of Petraeus and Crocker.
16680	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
16681	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
16682	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
16683	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
16685	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
16686	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
16687	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Several Republicans have hinted that their support will depend on a credible presentation by Petraeus, not only of tangible military progress but of evidence that the Iraqi government is taking real steps toward ethnic and religious reconciliation.
16689	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
16690	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the two may not be appearing in public.
16691	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	They said they will continue to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from Washington.
16692	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``If anything, we just don't know the dates/times/or the committees that the assessment will be presented to,'' a senior military official in Baghdad said in an e-mail Wednesday.
16693	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
16694	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
16695	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
16696	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.
16697	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Government Accountability Office is due to report on Iraqi political reconciliation and reconstruction by Sept. 1.
16698	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	An independent committee, headed by retired Marine Gen. James Jones, has been studying the training and capabilities of the Iraqi security forces and will report to Congress early next month.
16699	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few weeks.

16704	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
16705	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
16706	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Lloyd Shugart, sole proprietor of Studio 413 in Sodo, won the federal court victory against Prop?t late last month.

16708	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.

16710	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"It restored my faith in the legal system.
16711	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The jury paid close attention."
16712	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the big guy.
16713	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	It's one of these things where the system works for a change."
16714	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing.
16715	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
16716	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
16717	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit, Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay for $1.3 million.
16718	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
16719	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000 for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
16720	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights to them.
16721	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
16722	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
16723	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann and Shugart couldn't account for the fact that the total value of the jury award equaled the amount Shugart had planned to seek for the images on eBay.
16726	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
16727	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
16729	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
16732	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	US consumer prices jumped in January, the government reported Wednesday, a week after Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned that inflation remains the central bank's top concern.
16735	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
16736	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
16739	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	That is slightly above what economists see as the central bank's "comfort zone" of under 2.0 percent.
16741	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
16744	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	And minutes from the January 31 meeting of the Fed's policy committee, released Wednesday, showed that Bernanke and his colleagues "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."
16745	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
16747	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large 0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest such reading since August 1991," he said.
16748	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the second half of the year."
16749	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April 2005.
16750	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
16752	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Naroff cautioned that "investors should not assume that inflation has gone away," as blue-chip US shares sold off on the CPI news.
16753	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"And investors should start asking what they should expect for long-term inflation.
16754	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."
16756	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But the December reading was revised up to 0.6 percent.
16757	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said the US economy and consumer demand had proved "resilient" to high energy prices and a housing slump.

16761	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Militant rocket and mortar fire continued on Sunday, the Israeli army said, reporting that one person was slightly wounded.
16762	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	A Palestinian medic said a woman had been injured in northern Gaza by shrapnel from a tank shell but the military denied firing in the area.
16763	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"Israel must topple the Hamas rule in Gaza and a government under my command will do just that," Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, leader of the governing Kadima party, was quoted as saying by Israeli media.
16765	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the right-wing Likud party which is leading in opinion polls, echoed the sentiment.
16770	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	A senior Israeli defence official told AFP that a major military confrontation in the besieged territory was unavoidable.
16771	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"It is obvious where we are heading in Gaza.
16772	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The situation is intolerable but clear.
16773	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army's considerations are the only thing that is deciding when events will unfold," the official said on condition of anonymity.
16774	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	In Beit Hanun in the northern Gaza Strip, a Palestinian woman in her 40s was wounded by shrapnel from a tank shell on Sunday, a Palestinian medic said, but the Israeli army denied opening fire in the area.
16775	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some damage.
16776	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The armed wing of the radical Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is loosely linked to the Fatah movement of president Mahmud Abbas, claimed it was behind the rockets.
16777	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Tensions around Gaza have risen steadily since Friday, when Hamas said it would not renew a six-month truce with Israel that came into effect in June after months of Egyptian mediation.
16779	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Although several Israeli ministers have for weeks been calling for the army to oust the Islamist masters of Gaza, observers say the government is wary of launching a major offensive less than two months before the election for fear it would not be able to score a decisive victory.
16781	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"And worse than that, to be accused of having ordered a military operation just to improve their chances at the ballot box," he said.
16782	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel responded to violence that erupted around Gaza in early November by tightening its blockade of the territory and halting deliveries of humanitarian aid and other basic supplies.
16783	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The over-crowded and aid-dependent land of some 1.5 million people has been subject to an Israeli blockade and repeated raids since 2006, when Hamas won Palestinian elections and later joined in a deadly cross-border raid which saw militants capture an Israeli soldier who remains hostage to this day.

16787	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Wolinska, 88, who has lived in England since 1972 and is a British citizen, is accused of masterminding the wrongful arrest and execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II-era Polish hero, and of the wrongful arrest of 24 others.
16788	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
16789	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground Home Army, which rose up against the Nazi occupiers during World War II.
16790	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	After the war, he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new communist regime.
16791	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	A regional military court in Warsaw said that it had issued a European Arrest Warrant for Wolinska -- an EU warrant meant to speed up extraditions within the bloc.
16792	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	However, it wasn't immediately clear if Britain would follow through.
16793	APW_ENG_20071120.0538.LDC2009T13	Britain's Home Office refused a previous extradition request for Wolinska from Poland in 2006, arguing that the alleged wrongdoing had taken place too long ago.

16799	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Two Palestinian civilians were wounded by Israeli fire on Tuesday in the northern Gaza Strip, near the border with Israel, medics and witnesses said.
16801	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The Israeli army, which was not immediately available to comment on the incident, said two rockets were fired into Israel by militants in Gaza early Tuesday, landing without causing injuries or damage.
16802	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The incidents were the latest violations of a November 26 ceasefire, under which the Israeli army withdrew its troops from Gaza while Palestinian militants were to stop firing rockets into Israel.
16803	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Since then militants have fired more than 90 rockets at Israel, with 76 of them falling inside the Jewish state.
16804	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	At least three Palestinians have been killed and eight wounded by Israeli fire in the coastal strip.
16806	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	"The ceasefire with Israel is very important because, if Israel resumes assassinations and arrests it will destroy any chance of relaunching the peace process.

16812	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Last week, the company reported a rise in first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.

16881	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But in winter, Glacier is essentially shut down.
16882	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Its hotels and restaurants are closed and boarded up, its high mountain roads buried by deep, drifting snow.
16883	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The border crossing that is the summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until summer.
16884	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton Lakes, at the core of the Canadian park, comes close to doing the same.

16887	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The summer population of more than 2,000 shrinks to perhaps 100, many of them park staff.

16889	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make the offseason trek.

16895	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton plows a road eight miles (13 kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the Rockies.
16896	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	From there the remaining two miles (three kilometers) of unplowed road lead cross-country skiers or snowshoers to Cameron Lake, nestled in a cirque at 5,450 feet (1,660 meters) hard against the Continental Divide.
16897	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is one of the easiest and safest ways for winter visitors to view the high backcountry of the Canadian Rockies in winter.
16898	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers.
16899	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And all around are forest and mountains, inviting explorers on snowshoes.
16900	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Back down in the townsite is Cameron Falls, a spectacular waterfall on the edge of town that in winter is an easy destination for skiers who want an adventure a bit short of true wilderness.
16901	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of trees near the Kilmorey.

16904	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating this time of year and pose no threat.
16905	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895.
16906	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	In 1910, it became forever linked to its giant neighbor to the south -- Glacier Park is eight times bigger in area -- when James Hill, president of the Great Northern Railway in the U.S., decided to make Glacier and Waterton "the playground of the Northwest" with a network of hotels, camps, and chalets targeting wealthy tourists who would travel on his railroad.
16907	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others in Glacier park.

16909	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It still overlooks the village of Waterton, and staying there is a highlight for many summer visitors.
16910	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is closed in winter, and few even venture there because of the fierce and frigid winds that can howl down Upper Waterton Lake.
16911	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Those that do visit the Prince of Wales can see the thick steel cables that literally keep the huge hotel from blowing away.
16912	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
16913	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It makes for a pleasant evening stroll through the snow around the shore of the partially iced-over Emerald Bay, listening to the honking of hundreds of Canada geese.
16914	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Evening comes early in winter, and the glow from the lodge windows is an invitation.
16915	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Just off the lobby is a small, cheery pub where we can sit by the fireplace and look out over the snowy wilderness.
16916	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	As in many old inns, the rooms are each unique and range from cozy to spacious.
16917	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But all have antique furniture, plump mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and sleep late.
16918	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The rooms have no televisions, telephones or dataports, and there is no cell phone service
16919	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	this is not the place for such intrusions.
16920	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Dining at Kilmorey is a treat
16922	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
16923	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This night we opt for an appetizer of black tiger prawns sauteed with maple-infused Canadian whisky and a hint of crushed garlic.
16924	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	For a main course we choose pescatorie -- scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab, calamari, cod and prawns sauteed with garlic, Italian herbs and onion and finished with sauvignon blanc and cream, then tossed with linguine.
16925	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood- burning fireplace.
16927	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But it's always a quiet refuge, the perfect place to curl up with a good book, listen to the crackle of the fire and watch the softly falling snow deepen outside the door.
16928	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Perhaps we'll be snowed in.
16929	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We can always hope.

16946	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	His white helmet knocked askew, Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby slowly skidded on his back toward the Philadelphia Flyers' goal, picking up snow on the seat of his pants.
16947	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	He, and his team, did not look so invincible Thursday.
16948	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Facing elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers rediscovered the ferocity they had displayed in the first two rounds, scoring three first-period goals and then holding off Pittsburgh, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 19,972 at Wachovia Center.
16949	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the difference," Crosby said.
16950	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	After scoring one goal on nine power-play chances in the first three games of the series, all won by the Penguins, Philadelphia scored two power-play goals and avoided being swept from the Eastern Conference finals.
16951	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Game 5 is scheduled for Sunday in Pittsburgh.
16952	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Philadelphia goaltender Martin Biron stopped 36 of 38 shots against the Penguins, who had won 11 of their first 12 playoff games.
16953	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Jordan Staal scored Pittsburgh's goals in the third period, his second score coming with 5 minutes 49 seconds remaining.
16954	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to seal the victory.
16955	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	It was the second goal of the game for Lupul.
16956	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
16957	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval, the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
16958	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh penalty box.
16959	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' other elite center.
16960	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Stevens juggled his line combinations, placing Richards on his stagnant top line, which includes Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell.
16961	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Vinny Prospal centered a line with R.J. Umberger and Lupul.
16962	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere said he and Richards had chemistry on the power play throughout the year.
16963	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I thought, wow, maybe that could work five-on-five," Briere said.
16965	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Thirty seconds after a tripping penalty on Briere ended early in the first period, Lupul stormed into the Penguins' zone and took a slap shot at goaltender Marc-Andr?
16967	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh defenseman Hal Gill.
16973	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They're strong players."
16974	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Pittsburgh defenseman Brooks Orpik picked up a roughing penalty late in the first, and Jeff Carter scored a power-play goal with 1:10 left in the period by flicking in the rebound of a hard shot by Umberger, making the score 3-0.
16975	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	At the midway point of the first period, the Flyers had been outshot by the Penguins, 11-4.
16976	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Philadelphia ended the period with a 17-13 edge in shots.
16977	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers had eight shots through the first two periods of a 4-1 loss in Game 3 on Tuesday.
16978	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they've got offensive power," Biron said.
16979	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they can come up and score any time in the game.
16980	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	To have played the way we played in the first period really gave us a chance to be ready for their two goals in the third period.
16981	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	That gave us a cushion."

16983	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil
16984	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The illegal lottery known as "the animal game" is as visible a part of the urban landscape here as Ipanema beach or Sugarloaf Mountain.
16985	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	On thousands of street corners, vendors sit all day at little wooden booths, pads of paper in hand, taking money from bettors, who return later to check results posted on lampposts or walls.
16986	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The bosses of the billion-dollar industry known in Portuguese as the "jogo do bicho," on the other hand, have long preferred to operate in the shadows.
16987	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That was, at least, until a burgeoning corruption scandal suddenly thrust them into an uncomfortable national spotlight.
16988	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game.
16989	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	More than 40 people face criminal charges, mounds of documents have been seized and $6 million in cash has been confiscated.
16990	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed are some of the wealthiest and most powerful of the game's kingpins, as well as judges accused of issuing favorable rulings to keep the game running in return for payoffs, sometime as much as $15,000 a month.
16991	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Yet for all the talk of a crackdown, the game goes on.
16992	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	And to Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship between those who control the game and those who make and enforce the laws.
16993	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the 1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
16994	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering money," she added, "and contributes greatly to the problem of impunity in this country."
16995	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.
16996	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Players can bet on any combination of two-, three- or four-digit numbers, the last two digits of which are associated with any one of 25 animals, ranging from the alligator to the turkey.
16997	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The biggest payoff, $4,000 for a one-dollar bet, is awarded to those who "hit the thousand," or correctly pick a winning four-digit number.
16998	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"If I dream of a rooster, well then of course I'll bet on a rooster," said Silvio Cunha, who works as a doorman at an apartment building here.
16999	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"When my mother comes to visit, I bet on her flight number, and when I get my telephone bill I bet on that number too.
17000	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	You need always to be alert to numbers that can bring you luck."
17001	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The animal game was created in the 1890s by the owner of a zoo here as a way to promote his venture.
17002	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	It became almost instantly popular, which soon led the government, fearing that money would be drained away from official lotteries, to ban it.
17003	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	For decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent campaigns to snuff it out.
17005	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless it survives.
17007	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Winning numbers are picked twice daily at a downtown building that serves as the syndicate headquarters.
17008	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The results are immediately sent to the thousands of betting points across the country.
17009	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Brazilian slang is peppered with references to the animal game.
17010	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros recur as characters in Brazilian films, novels and television programs, most recently on an HBO miniseries similar to "The Sopranos."
17011	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Numerous sambas have been written about the game.
17012	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In one of the most famous, "I Hit the Thousand," a lucky bettor exults at fulfilling the poor man's dream: "I won 500 smackers, and now I'm not going to work anymore."
17013	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Though many Brazilians are reluctant to acknowledge it, bicheiros also play a central, even essential, role in Carnival here.
17015	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	This year and last, directors of samba schools were killed shortly before Carnival in what the authorities described as murders related to disputes about control of the animal game.
17016	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed in this most recent scandal was Ailton Guimaraes, president of the league of samba schools, who is said by authorities to be the animal game's boss of bosses.
17018	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But at a court hearing in April he said that he was active in the animal game only between 1982 and 1993 and that he made his living now as a "financial consultant," earning commissions of as much as $200,000 a month from clients investing in the stock market.
17019	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He's the one who brought an organizational sense and structure to the game," said Frossard, the former judge, who has been the target of assassination attempts that she attributes to hired guns in the pay of game kingpins.
17020	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He also encouraged the group to try to capture the state, at all three levels of government and all three branches, instead of just paying off the police."
17021	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known here as "nickel hunters."
17022	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the leftist Workers' Party.
17023	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	When the party governed Rio Grande do Sul, the home state of Brazil's justice minister, animal game kingpins donated $500,000 for the purchase of the party headquarters there, a former party official said at a parliamentary inquiry.
17024	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	At one point a tape was played in which a party fundraiser could be heard urging the chief of police to go easy on numbers runners.
17025	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In 2004, a videotape surfaced in which one of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's top political operatives was seen offering to rewrite an online lottery contract to favor an animal game boss nicknamed Charlie Waterfall.
17027	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterward, da Silva, who had originally favored legalizing the animal game, issued a temporary decree outlawing bingo parlors.
17028	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But the Senate refused to make the measure permanent.
17029	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros and their associates have obtained judicial rulings, many of them issued by judges later arrested, that have blunted the effect of the prohibition.
17030	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Da Silva's chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, has now indicated that the government is considering an about-face and is at least willing to study the possibility of legalizing the animal game.
17031	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"It's not a simple question," she said recently, but "it's obvious that as the investigations deepen, an institutional model for the question of games of chance is going to be delineated in Brazil."
17032	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Some Brazilians oppose legalization on moral grounds or because they fear that it would attract foreign crime organizations.
17033	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Others are simply skeptical.
17034	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"I'd wager that legalization is never going to happen," Luiz Carlos Menezes de Sa, a waiter, predicted after placing a 50-cent bet on 3568, a number associated with the monkey.
17035	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Without their bribes from the bicheiros, the politicians, cops and judges wouldn't be able to live high on the hog the way they do," he said.
17036	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Why would they want to do away with something that makes so much money for them?"

17039	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The famous shipyard here, where the world-changing events of the Solidarity movement played out, is once again the subject of a standoff, this time between the Polish government and the European Union.
17040	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	The Gdansk shipyard could go bankrupt if it is forced to pay back millions in disputed state subsidies deemed illegal by European officials.
17041	NYT_ENG_20070825.0080.LDC2009T13	But the most surprising thing may be that there has been little popular outcry over the threat to the famous port.

17066	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The sister of Spanish Crown Princess Letizia, it seems, is a celebrity whether she likes it or not.
17067	APW_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	A judge rejected a request from Telma Ortiz for a restraining order barring media outlets from filming her, arguing Thursday that she is a public figure despite her wishes.

17084	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	This editorial appeared in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times:
17085	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Western observers tend to regard the political success of Islamists in the Middle East as bad news, because elections have brought to power such dangerous hard-liners as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.
17086	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Yet the strong victory of the main Islamist party in Sunday's election in Turkey -- the world's prime laboratory for an experiment in whether Islam is compatible with democracy -- was a very hopeful development.
17089	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	This elite, which runs the judiciary and the military, threatened to undermine the country's democracy in April, when army leaders hinted that they would stage a coup if an AKP candidate whose wife wears a head scarf were elevated to the presidency.
17090	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	In Turkey it's the Islamists, or at least the liberal Islamists who head the AKP, who promote religious freedom and tolerance, while secularists' fears of a religious takeover of government institutions have prompted hysteria over matters as seemingly harmless as a scarf.
17091	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	The AKP's popularity is soaring because of measures that have tamed inflation and led to strong economic growth in just six years, and its support of Turkish efforts to become a member of the European Union has produced progressive legal reforms.
17092	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the nationalistic Republican People's Party, the party of Ataturk, opposes EU membership and favors military intervention in Iraq to discourage attacks from Kurdish separatists.
17095	LTW_ENG_20070725.0077.LDC2009T13	For the U.S., that means a renewed push to resolve the Kurdish problem diplomatically.

17099	APW_ENG_20080415.0761.LDC2009T13	Czech police say hundreds of bronze plaques have been stolen from a Holocaust memorial in a Jewish cemetery near Prague.
17100	APW_ENG_20080415.0761.LDC2009T13	Police spokeswoman Alena Romova says 327 plaques with names of the dead were taken last week from the state-sponsored Theresienstadt memorial.
17101	APW_ENG_20080415.0761.LDC2009T13	There have been no indications that the theft had an anti-Semitic motivation.
17102	APW_ENG_20080415.0761.LDC2009T13	Romova said Tuesday the plaques may have been stolen for resale as raw bronze.
17103	APW_ENG_20080415.0761.LDC2009T13	The damage is estimated at about 1 million koruna (euro40,000

17107	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	Three Slovenian volunteer firefighters have been detained on suspicious of arson in 60 fires since December in a northeastern city, a police chief said Monday.
17110	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	The fires included ones at an abandoned psychiatric clinic, a sports field under construction and a warehouse, Fank said.
17111	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	The damages caused are estimated at euro750,000 (US$1 million), he said.
17112	APW_ENG_20070917.0809.LDC2009T13	If formally indicted and convicted, the three face up to eight years in prison.

17116	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan has appealed for more NATO help to attack heroin dealers whose thriving trade is blamed for bankrolling the widening insurgency against the pro-Western government and international forces.
17121	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Most allies agree, but Gates complained that some allies were balking at the plan for NATO to take on a task currently the responsibility of Afghanistan's fledgling police force.
17123	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	They also fear widening the mission could overstretch the hard- pressed troops and undermine NATO's long-term goal of handing more responsibility to Afghan forces.
17124	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	However Germany's defense minister hinted they could change their position in the light of Wardak's appeal.
17125	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"If this remains under Afghan leadership, it is in our own interest to support this activity," Franz Josef Jung, told reporters.
17127	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"I hope that tomorrow morning ministers will be able to come to some form of a conclusion," said Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.
17128	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"Our guys are killed by the weapons bought by the Taliban, financed by drugs money."
17129	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Gates said one option on the table was to allow some nations who are opposed to the plan to "opt out" without blocking others from participating.
17132	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Reflecting concerns that Afghanistan is becoming the critical battlefield in the fight against terrorism, the U.S. has already said it would send about 8,000 troops to Afghanistan by early next year.
17134	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"I'm not satisfied and I'm not happy about the way the allies are performing in this regard," he told reporters, saying a lack of helicopters and transport planes remained a particular problem.
17136	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	NATO says any decision to open talks with the Taliban is up to the Afghan government, but it will offer support.
17137	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	"This is a matter for the Afghan government," de Hoop Scheffer said.
17138	APW_ENG_20081010.0035.LDC2009T13	Thirty-three thousand U.S. troops make up the bulk of the international forces in Afghanistan, including 13,000 with the NATO-led force, and 20,000 fighting the insurgency and training Afghan forces outside NATO command.

17335	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists in the Netherlands have uncovered what they believe is part of the military road that marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire from the middle of the first century A.D.
17336	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Train company Prorail made the initial discovery during preparations to add extra rail lines in the city of Houten, 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Utrecht.
17337	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	"It's in very good condition," said Houten city spokeswoman Marloes van Kessel.
17338	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and Prorail will complete an excavation of a short stretch in the coming weeks, and carry out exploratory digs to determine the further route of the road, the city said in a statement.
17340	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Only traces of the Dutch road, which generally followed branches of the Rhine river east to Germany, have been preserved.
17341	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Although the limes' course is known from ancient maps, archaeologists have been unable to locate it south of Utrecht and the stretch found in Houten is believed to have connected two forts: Fectio, modern Vechten, and Traiectum, modern Utrecht.
17342	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Romans first entered this part of the Netherlands under Julius Caesar in the year 53 B.C.
17343	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Fectio was established around 9 A.D., but Utrecht was not built until 47 A.D., as Romans fought German tribes for control of the area, including trade on the river -- and built full-fledged roads, good for rapid movement of troops.

17346	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Pottery shards were used as filler material in several places, which should aid in dating.
17347	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	The discovery is the latest of several in the area of Utrecht.
17349	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Near the tower, they found bones and other remains of food the soldiers ate and such objects as a spearpoint, a coin, an ax, a sickle and an ancient pen.

17360	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday the ball is now in North Korea's court after six-party talks here with her North Korean counterpart on verifying Pyongyang's nuclear disarmament.
17361	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the North Koreans left with any illusions about the fact that the ball is in their court, and that everybody believes that they have got to respond and respond positively on verification," Rice told reporters.
17362	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Rice held an informal meeting in Singapore on Wednesday with the foreign ministers of North Korea, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea on establishing arrangments for verification under a US draft protocol.
17364	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Begun in 2003 before lapsing for three years, the six-country disarmament negotiations resumed after North Korea staged its first nuclear test in 2006, finally producing a landmark denuclearisation agreement in February 2007.
17365	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The negotiations then hit a deadlock at the end of last year when North Korea failed to meet a deadline to fully disable its weapons-grade plutonium plants and deliver a full accounting of its nuclear activities, including a suspected uranium enrichment program.
17366	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The deadlock was broken last month when North Korea handed over a partial accounting or "declaration" of its plutonium-related programmes that must now be completely dismantled and the whole process verified.
17369	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I think it should be very well understood that unless we're satisfied that we can verify the declaration, we have been very clear that we're taking that into our assessment of when to go forward," Rice said.
17371	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	But she said there are "internationally recognised methods to verify the number of kilograms of plutonium made."
17372	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The protocol will "have to have specific measures, it will have to have means for access, and it will also have to have means to continue this process as new information becomes available," Rice said.
17373	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"This will be a strong protocol.
17374	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	All the parties yesterday talked about a rigorous protocol, talked about one that is to international standards."

17409	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince's future hung on a thread on Saturday after his side side suffered a sixth successive Premiership defeat 3-0 to Wigan Athletic managed by former Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce.
17410	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Defeat means that Blackburn - champions in 1996 - are second from bottom of the table and in danger of being relegated for the second time in their Premiership history, haivng been relegated under former Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd.
17411	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Goals from England international Emile Heskey, the outstanding Antonio Valencia and Lee Cattermole wrapped up the three points for Wigan.
17412	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Wigan took the lead in the 12th minute through Heskey, seizing on an excellent cross from Antonio Valencia and flicking it past England goalkeeper Paul Robinson.
17413	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Wigan doubled their lead two minutes later and this time it was Valencia who netted as Robinson failed to clear convincingly and Dutch defender Mario Melchiot headed on to Valencia, who took full advantage without a Rovers player even trying to tackle him.
17414	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Ince sent on fit again David Dunn at the start of the second-half for Morten Gamst Pedersen as he desperately searched for some inspiration and within six minutes Rovers went close to reducing the deficit as Christopher Samba's header went wide of the goal from Australian winger Brett Emerton's cross.
17415	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	However, Wigan went desperately close to making it 3-0 in the 57th minute as leading scorer Amr Zaki unleashed a shot from close on the goal but it went wide.
17416	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Dunn took time to get going after a long lay-off with an Achilles tendon injury but finally produced a shot worthy of Chris Kirkland making a save in the 66th minute.
17417	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	It was Wigan, though, who deservedly extended their lead in the 77th minute as Cattermole drove home from just inside the area following anothe rgood piece of work by the seemingly tireless Valencia.

17445	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	2007-08-05 17:48:03 UTC
17447	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Six decades after World War II, about 240,000 survivors live in Israel and many say that instead of spending their final years in dignity, they lack money for medicines, psychological treatment and in some cases even for food.
17449	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Now 82, Charney donned a yellow star once again on Sunday to protest Israel's treatment of its Holocaust survivors.
17450	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Charney was among at least 500 survivors and supporters who rallied outside the parliament building, carrying placards and wearing stickers reading "The Holocaust is still here" and "Forgive us for surviving."
17452	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"The government of Israel has not recognized us.
17453	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	We don't belong to them."
17455	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Many suffered physical or psychological damage from the torture and deprivation they suffered at the hands of the Nazis.
17456	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	The current flare-up over Israel's treatment of Holocaust survivors began last week, when the government announced $28 million in new stipends for 120,000 needy survivors -- about half of those now in Israel.
17457	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	That works out to just 83 shekels -- or $20 -- a month for each survivor, a sum critics deemed woefully inadequate.
17458	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We don't think that 83 shekels a month is enough" said Gal Rotem of the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund, which helped organize the march.
17459	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"You can't buy food or drugs or anything else with 83 shekels."
17460	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	By definition an elderly group, many of whom are unwell, an average of 35 of the survivors die each day, she added.
17461	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	At Sunday's weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the issue was "sensitive and painful" and acknowledged that previous governments had failed to address it.
17462	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	He added that he would meet Wednesday with representatives of survivors' groups and the heads of various government ministries to find the "best, fairest and most just solution," a statement from his office quoted him as saying.
17463	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Sunday's protesters, however, doubted the government would act quickly.
17464	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"Until they say what the solution is, we won't believe anything else," Rotem said.
17465	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"It's not a good feeling that Holocaust survivors have to walk and march to say to Olmert that they are still alive and need help."
17466	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	Others expressed sadness that Israeli has not helped survivors more.

17469	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	In 1951 Fogel came to Israel, where her whole family now lives.
17470	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"My revenge is to be here in Israel with daughter and granddaughter," she said.
17471	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"But thinking about how other survivors live...my heart just hurts."
17472	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"We can't imagine what they went through," added her daughter, Yardit Ishai.
17473	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"I can't stand the thought that someone who was hungry, that someone who was almost killed, is hungry today."
17474	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	As the marchers listened to speeches by survivors, Sari Rivkin of Jerusalem leaned on a sign with three black and white photos of Holocaust survivors.
17475	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	In her work as the head of an Israeli nonprofit, she said, she had seen survivors who have to chose between buying food or medicine.
17476	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	"The government's response is to delay as long as possible, hoping the problem will go away," she said.

17488	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	A Sept. 25, 2001, Justice Department memo declared that under the Constitution decisions regarding the "amount of military force to be used" in response to the terrorist threat, as well as "the method, timing and nature of the response," are "for the president alone to make."
17489	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."
17490	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
17491	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop without obtaining a court order on calls and e-mail messages sent from the United States to other countries.
17492	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	He has issued a steady stream of signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority to limit coercive interrogation tactics.
17493	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And the administration has claimed that the president's war powers give him the authority to detain people indefinitely and deny them access to lawyers and the courts, policy that it would later be forced to modify in response to legal challenges.
17494	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In their chilling and timely book Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, and Aziz Z. Huq, who directs the Liberty and National Security Project at the Brennan Center, argue that the Bush administration's "monarchist claims of executive power" are "unprecedented on this side of the North Atlantic," and that its "executive unilateralism not only undermines the delicate balance of our Constitution, but also lessens our human liberties and hurts vital counterterrorism campaigns" by undermining America's moral authority and standing in the world.
17495	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe.
17496	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	But the book serves as a valuable compendium and chronicle of the Bush administration's aggressive efforts to expand the power of the executive branch, providing a detailed account of the unilateral actions it has taken on matters ranging from torture policy to domestic surveillance, and it is necessary reading for anyone interested in how those efforts by the Bush White House have tipped the constitutional system of checks and balances.
17497	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Schwarz was chief counsel for the Church committee, which investigated executive branch overreaching in the mid 1970s, and he and Huq have done a powerful job of situating the actions of the current White House in perspective with the imperial presidency of Richard M. Nixon (who once declared that "when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal").
17498	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
17499	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	They remind the reader that the founding fathers had "scant affection for strong executives" like England's king, and they argue that many of the Bush White House's claims are rooted in ideas "about the 'divine' right of kings" that "did not survive the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution of 1688" and that certainly did not find their "way into our founding documents, the 1776 Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of 1787."
17500	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Like many reporters Huq and Schwarz point out that expanded executive power was not a response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 but the realization of a vision that conservatives like Dick Cheney had harbored since the 1970s, when they grew aggrieved over post-Watergate reforms that put the brakes on presidential power.
17501	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	That conservative backlash gained ground during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in the minority report of the Iran-contra committee.
17505	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In February of 2002 President Bush signed an order declaring that "none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world," a decision that would set the nation on a slippery slope toward torture, leading to the abuses at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run prisons.
17506	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately narrow definition of torture.
17507	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	One 2002 memo defined it as causing the sort of "intense pain or suffering" ordinarily associated "with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result."
17508	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although significant public and congressional attention was focused on the Patriot Act (which itself created an uproar over the threat it posed to Americans' civil liberties), Huq and Schwarz write, "the official responses to the September 11, 2001, attacks largely took shape through under-the-radar executive orders" that not only excluded Congress from the debate but in many cases also circumvented the interagency policy-making process, cutting out experts from the State Department and members of the uniformed military.
17510	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although briefings were provided to a handful of congressional leaders, Schwarz and Huq report, those leaders were prohibited from saying anything about them to anyone, including other intelligence committee members, a stipulation that "gutted the possibility of effective oversight."
17511	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Making the executive supreme makes the nation no safer -- either from its enemies or its own worse impulses," the authors conclude.
17513	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Our government was framed 'to control itself,' as James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers.
17514	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	'Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'
17515	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Dividing powers between three branches, the Founders harnessed human passions in the cause of limited government.
17516	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."'

17619	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	A glitch with Russian computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) was probably caused by a solar panel installed by American astronauts, a Russian space construction firm said Thursday.
17620	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	"Russian specialists believe that the new solar panel installed by the Atlantis astronauts during their spacewalk could be the origin (of the breakdown)," said Irina Gomenyuk, a spokeswoman for Energia, which designed much of the station.
17621	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	This "new powerful source of energy caused a malfunction of sensitive system elements" on the Russian and American segments of the station, in particular of the electrical supply system, Gomenyuk was quoted as saying by ITAR-TASS.
17622	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	NASA said earlier Thursday that there had been a breakdown in communication with Russian computers that control the ISS's critical oxygen and water supplies.
17623	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	Communications were later restored.
17624	AFP_ENG_20070614.0576.LDC2009T13	Two US astronauts spent more than seven hours outside the ISS Wednesday working on its solar power panels as part of a huge expansion of the station's generation capacity.

17640	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK (AP) -- With so many jokes and cartoons about Sigmund Freud floating around, one gets the impression that psychoanalysis is no longer valid as a serious tool of psychological inquiry, but a closer look shows that it is just the opposite.
17641	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Nearly 70 years after his death, Freud's spiritual heirs are still turning out learned papers with great enthusiasm, attempting to shed light into the dark recesses of the human mind.
17642	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Providing a perfect forum for them is "The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child," an annual started in 1945 by Anna Freud, the icon's psychoanalyst daughter, and her colleagues.
17643	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The title seems to suggest that it only pertains to children, but actually, it brims with articles of great human interest and originality on topics that range from infancy to grandfatherhood, from the origins of aggression to the mysteries of human resilience.
17644	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The volume is divided into five categories: Clinical Contributions

17649	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Of particular interest to the general readership is probably the last one, which deals with the psychoanalytic investigation of movies, literature, philosophy and religion, among others.
17650	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	An article by Eugene J. Mahon, M.D., a training and supervising analyst at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute in New York, for example, offers an intriguing view of "purgatory."
17651	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Purgatory as a concept was not always with us, he states.
17652	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	It was "invented" by the human mind several hundred years ago to get it out of the dilemma that the absolute concepts -- Heaven and Hell -- had created for themselves in the first place, he theorizes.
17653	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	He implies provocatively that this theological concept may have unwittingly influenced Freud, who was an atheist, when he began to reflect on the unconscious dimensions of guilt and human morality as he set about "inventing" his own famous concept, the Superego, the internal moral voice.

17661	XIN_ENG_20080910.0130.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Sept. 10 (Xinhua)
17662	XIN_ENG_20080910.0130.LDC2009T13	As many as 28 people were killed as security forces pounded militants' hideouts in Pakistan' s tribal area on Wednesday, private DAWN NEWS TV channel reported.
17663	XIN_ENG_20080910.0130.LDC2009T13	The security forces pounded militants' hideouts with jets in Bajaur Agency, leaving 28 people, including three civilians, dead, said the report.
17664	XIN_ENG_20080910.0130.LDC2009T13	Backed by gunship helicopters, Pakistan Army and paramilitary Frontier Corps on Tuesday launched a joint major and first-ever ground operation against militants in Bajaur Agency.
17665	XIN_ENG_20080910.0130.LDC2009T13	They launched an operation against militants in Loisam, Rashkai and Samkhata areas with air strikes, according to private Geo TV channel.
17670	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	"India is a thriving democracy and they have work to do and they may need some additional time on their end to get their part of this deal done," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
17672	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	But no, it's not -- it's not dead," Fratto said.
17673	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	According to a report by the Washington Post Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told U.S. President George W. Bush on Monday that "certain difficulties" would prevent India from moving forward on the pact for the foreseeable future.
17674	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	Besieged over the past two months by growing opposition to nuclear energy cooperation with the United States, Singh indicated over the weekend that he would rather save his coalition government than the nuclear pact, the report said.
17677	XIN_ENG_20071016.0346.LDC2009T13	But U.S. Congress attached several conditions to the law and the two countries have returned to negotiations.

17683	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	The head of the UN's children fund has raised concerns over the spread of HIV in Mozambique, saying it was partly fueled by immigrants from Zimbabwe who were selling their bodies to make ends meet.
17684	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	UNICEF executive director Ann Veneman told reporters at the end of a three-day official visit on Saturday that her organisation "was concerned by high levels of HIV infection in the country."
17685	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	"We are working with the ministry of the interior in dealing with uncontrolled immigration of Zimbabwean women who are engaged in sexual activities in central Mozambique."
17686	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	She did not give details of the organisation's work with the government.
17687	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	Large numbers of women are believed to have fled poverty-stricken Zimbabwe, labouring under the world's highest inflation rate and major food shortages, to work as prostitutes in neighbouring Mozambique.
17688	AFP_ENG_20080803.0297.LDC2009T13	According to government figures, Mozambique's HIV prevalence rate among the 16-to-49 age group is estimated at more than 16 percent.
17690	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Movie review: Twisted revenge tale `Teeth ' will leave you laughing and squirming
17691	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-01-18 00:44:11 UTC
17693	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's a film that had audiences laughing and squirming simultaneously last year at Sundance, where it earned an acting prize for its fresh-faced, fearless star, Jess Weixler.
17694	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth.
17695	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Yes, she is a living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his feature debut.
17696	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge tale.
17697	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross- out factor he'd established early on.
17698	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(You do see severed, um, parts.)
17700	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	She's part of an organization known as The Promise, and gives out red plastic rings for kids to wear as a reminder of their chastity.
17701	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Even kissing is a no-no.
17702	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But Lichtenstein never makes fun of her, and Weixler, whose wholesome blond looks are reminiscent of a younger Heather Graham, treats the character with just as much respect.
17703	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Dawn may be fiercely protective of her innocence in reaction to an event that took place when she was a very young girl, something she doesn't even remember but we see at the film's start.
17705	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	years later, grown-up Brad (John Hensley from "Nip/Tuck"), is tatted, pierced, perpetually stoned and hates women.
17706	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But he still wants to do it with Dawn, and the fact that she's so fearful of her budding sexuality only makes her more desirable.
17707	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Being a teenager, though, her curiosity eventually takes over and she allows herself to become interested in a boy in the abstinence group, the slightly goofy Tobey (Hale Appleman).
17708	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But when he tries to go too far with her while swimming at the lake one afternoon, he learns too late that no really does mean no.
17709	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	A visit to the gynecologist to find out what's wrong with her also has disastrous consequences.
17711	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Eventually, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew (sorry, couldn't resist) as Dawn feels increasingly comfortable in her own skin and begins seducing men who deserve their comeuppance.
17712	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(Its climactic moment, if you will, is way too over the top.)
17713	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	And a subplot involving her dying mother seems out of place in contrast with the comedy.
17714	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But it's easy to imagine "Teeth" gaining a cult following through midnight showings
17715	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	it's the kind of movie you want to watch with friends, to laugh and scream and not have to think too hard, and then who knows?
17716	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Maybe go home and get lucky afterward.

17721	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	Falling food prices lowered Kenya's overall annual inflation rate to 5.7 percent in April from 5.9 percent in March this year, the country's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said Thursday.
17722	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	In a statement, the CBS said that the underlying inflation rate, which excludes changes in the prices of food items, declined to 5.
17723	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	9 per cent in April from 6.1 percent in March.
17724	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 1.3 percent from March to April," the CBS said.
17725	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices over time in fixed market baskets of goods and services typically purchased by consumers.
17726	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	The statement said food and nonalcoholic drinks index eased by 2.1 percent in April compared with March.
17727	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	This, according to the CBS, was mainly attributed to a fall in prices of tomatoes, kales, maize flour, sugar and maize grain.
17728	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	The power and fuel index declined by 0.9 percent due to a drop in the cost of electricity.
17729	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	Kenyans are expected to pay less for fuel and electric power, whose costs were expected to remain low following increased hydroelectric capacity, buoyed by heavy rains and flooding.

17741	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Losman came on for injured rookie Trent Edwards against the New York Jets last weekend and piloted the Bills to a 13-3 victory.
17742	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Jauron, who just one week earlier had tabbed Edwards as his starter, said a sprained right wrist suffered by his rookie quarterback prompted the switch.
17743	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	"J.P. Losman will start Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals," Jauron said in a statement.
17744	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	"Trent Edwards' wrist will prevent him from participating until late in the week, if at all."
17745	AFP_ENG_20071030.0014.LDC2009T13	Edwards had been elevated to the starting role when Losman suffered an ankle injury in the third week of the season.

17755	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-10-25 20:23:22 UTC
17756	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	The criminal investigation of New York's former police commissioner is on track to crash headlong into the Republican presidential race -- and Rudy Giuliani's final push for the nomination.
17757	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Since former Mayor Giuliani began campaigning, he has sought to distance himself from Bernard Kerik and to blunt the political fallout from his relationship with his ex-police commissioner, business partner and close friend.
17758	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani has accepted responsibility for his role in Kerik's embarrassing 2004 withdrawal as President Bush's Homeland Security nominee amid tax problems.
17760	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president," Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly vetted his associate of nearly two decades.
17761	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Such acknowledgments may not be enough for Giuliani to emerge politically unscathed as prosecutors wrap up their investigation of Kerik on multiple federal felony charges.
17762	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Kerik is expected to confront the results of the investigation as early as next month -- and it is widely believed he will either be indicted or reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.
17763	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should prosecutors charge Kerik and the case reach trial, Giuliani could end up being called to testify during the general election campaign.
17764	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should Kerik agree to a plea deal, he could be admitting guilt on some level for activities that may have taken place while the city employed him -- and on Giuliani's watch.
17765	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	At the very least, the case will be in the headlines again, especially if soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Michael Mukasey, another Giuliani friend, recuses himself from any Justice Department prosecution of Kerik.
17766	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani aides play down any political implications, but they acknowledge that Kerik's woes could be a distraction during a period in which they want their candidate promoting his vision for the United States.
17767	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"It will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up," said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political science professor.
17768	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"And, they very well might, especially if he's the front-runner."
17769	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	If Giuliani wins the nomination, Shapiro said, "the Democrats will make this an issue.
17770	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	You can count on that."
17776	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	It speaks to capability and leadership," Shapiro said.
17782	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	"We had a treaty yesterday, and today we went straight into high quality debate on the real issue for the future ... the issue of how Europe can successfully rise to the challenges of globalization, " he said.
17783	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	He said the EU is ready to tackle the challenges of globalization and intends to "lead" the world debate on globalization, in three areas in particular.
17784	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	The three areas are redesigning of global institutions, the globalization agenda, which should be an agenda of innovation but not of isolation or protectionism, and the environmental issue, especially climate change.
17785	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, he said the EU leaders also discussed the issue of stability of the EU financial market.
17786	XIN_ENG_20071019.0189.LDC2009T13	He said the leaders had confidence in the EU economy, and pledged their full support to the EU finance ministers who are drawing up a plan to increase transparency on risk assessment of the financial market.

17790	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	President Chen Shui-bian will visit the Marshall Islands next month to attend the Taiwan-South Pacific leaders' summit scheduled to take place Oct. 12, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday.
17791	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	MOFA officials said President Chen will depart for the Marshall Islands Oct. 11, one day after the Double Ten National Day celebration activities.

17794	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	They noted that President Chen said earlier that he hopes New Zealand can send officials to the meeting as observers.
17795	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	The ministry is also actively working to have Australia send officials as observers, they added.
17796	CNA_ENG_20070922.0017.LDC2009T13	The MOFA is also communicating with the United States on the feasibility of President Chen making a stopover in Guam en route to the Marshall Islands, although the ministry is not ruling out the possibility of arranging transit stops in other locations, they said.
17802	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The representative of the Dubai-based TV station spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue involving its reporter Hassan Fahas, based in Tehran since 2000.
17803	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The network's representative did not want to elaborate on how the decision of Iranian Information Ministry to revoke Fahas' press accreditation and declare him "persona non grata" will affect Al- Arabiya's news office in Iran, involving a staff of a dozen reporters, producers and cameramen.
17807	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	The network has rejected the criticism, saying that it had always given Iranian officials the chance to take part in its programs.
17808	APW_ENG_20080902.0781.LDC2009T13	Al-Arabiya opened its Tehran office in 2003.

17813	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	ANKARA, Sept. 19 (Xinhua)
17814	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that efforts were being exerted to prepare a new constitution for Turkey, not for his Justice and Development Party (AKP).
17816	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The top official said that "We are going to submit the draft constitution to parliament after a great deal of discussion is made on it."
17817	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	In an interview with the British daily Financial Times published on Wednesday, Erdogan said, "we want a constitution that is going to provide and protect a state that is a democratic, secular, social state of law."
17818	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	According to the official, a wide-ranging debate would be held on the new constitution, which is being drafted by a team led by constitutional scholars.
17819	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been involved in preparing alternatives for the constitution and the European Constitution was also taken into consideration during the drafting process.
17820	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The cabinet is due to submit the final version of the draft by early next week to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a referendum is expected to be held to ratify the constitution.
17821	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	Turkey has had three constitutions so far and the current constitution, which was written in the early 1980s, is the third one which had often been criticized as being too restrictive.
17822	XIN_ENG_20070919.0266.LDC2009T13	The first one was adopted in the early 20th century when modern Turkey was founded and the second one was approved after a military coup in 1961.
17823	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California ' s big reds have some saying less is more
17825	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California's big reds are coming on strong these days as winemakers pursue riper, fuller-flavored fruit.
17828	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	More mature fruit is thought to make tastier wine, but it also means sugar levels have a chance to rise, which comes with the side effect of pumping up the alcohol volume.
17829	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Warmer harvests only increase the phenomenon.
17831	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
17832	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Darrell Corti, president of Corti Brothers, a Sacramento wine and food market, is also in the less-is-more camp, announcing last year his store won't carry table wines over 14.5 percent alcohol.
17835	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	you can chew on them.
17837	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	For those who don't like the big wines, some have an issue with the style of higher-alcohol vintages while others are wary of the punch they can pack.
17838	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One definition of the "right" alcohol level is if two people can finish a bottle and "wish there was a little bit more," said Dunn.
17839	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.
17840	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You'd be lying on the floor."
17841	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	It's not always easy to tell just how much alcohol is in a wine.
17842	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
17843	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	When a percentage is listed it can be off by up to 1.5 percent, a tolerance granted because one batch of wine may differ from another, said Art Resnick, spokesman for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in Washington, D.C. Wines over 14 percent alcohol, which fall into a higher tax category, must list alcohol levels with a tolerance of plus or minus 1 percent.
17844	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
17845	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
17851	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Vinovation's process works by using powerful filters that remove alcohol and water from wine.
17852	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
17853	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
17854	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
17855	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the grower," he said.
17856	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	At Shafer Vineyards, a Napa Valley producer of highly rated reds, some coming in at 14.9 percent, winery president Doug Shafer won't use technology to reduce alcohol.
17857	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"We like our wines.
17858	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the fruit.
17859	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the richness," he said.
17860	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Shafer is aware of the debate over how much is too much, but says it's up to consumers to decide what style of wine they prefer.
17861	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling everything," he points out.
17862	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Industry wide, "the quality of wines from around the world just keep getting better and better," Shafer said.

17871	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it needs unity against the powerful Democrats.

17874	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And it's impossible that I'm still in the race.
17875	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That's what most people would have said a few months ago."
17876	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Showing the force of his evangelical Christian base, Huckabee trounced McCain on Saturday in Kansas's caucuses, winning 60 percent support against the Arizona senator's 20 percent.
17877	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	In Louisiana, Huckabee squeaked out a narrow win, 43 percent to 42 percent.
17879	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He said Sunday however that he would launch a challenge to the Washington State caucus results, complaining that far too few of votes were counted when the election was called in McCain's favor.
17880	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he rejected calls for to pull out of the race.
17881	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"The fact they're blowing against me hardly motivates me to quit," he told reporters in Washington.
17883	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	If they think they're getting a chorus of voices that will make me say okay, it's time to leave, they don't know me very well."
17884	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee remains way behind McCain in the crucial delegate count, with just 234 to McCain's 724 -- out of 1,191 needed to clinch the nomination -- according to poll-tracker RealClearPolitics.com.
17885	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But he refused to concede any inevitability Sunday.
17886	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm prepared to stay in until somebody has 1,191 delegates because that's the magic number at which a person is the nominee of the party," Huckabee insisted on CBS.
17888	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"So are we to tell them, 'Forget your vote
17889	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	we don't even care what you think?"
17890	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee's success has come on the back of the party's conservatives, who have made well-known their disgust with McCain, branding him a "closet liberal."
17891	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Christian conservatives have especially latched onto Huckabee's religious values and opposition to abortion.
17892	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I do think (McCain) has got some challenges with not just the evangelicals, but frankly the economic conservatives, because of his opposition to the (President George W.) Bush tax cuts," Huckabee said on NBC.
17893	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	McCain's views on immigration "were way out of the mainstream and quite unorthodox.
17894	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He has been often the voice in the wilderness," he added.
17895	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee also argues that his experience as a state governor and his stance for a radical reform of the US tax system would make him a better president.
17897	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think senators have the luxury of taking several issues, maybe two or three, and they can specialize in them."
17898	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"But in terms of seeing the whole playing field, they've never managed the whole field."
17899	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Huckabee's refusal to pull out of the race -- as did Mitt Romney on Thursday -- could deepen the party division between conservatives and Republicans ready to back McCain because he stands the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in November.
17900	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But the conservatives are also said to hope their resistance to McCain could push him to adopt more of their positions, like an absolute opposition to abortion and a crackdown on illegal immigrants.

17908	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Taipei, April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07 17:56:37 (By Lilian Wu)
17909	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The National Teachers' Association said Monday that teachers can make unruly students stand so that "they can reflect upon their wrongs."
17910	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The association issued the clarification after the Apple Daily, a local tabloid, reported that the Ministry of Education will soon publish guidelines for teachers counselling or disciplining students.
17911	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	One claim by the paper was that teachers, when disciplining students, would need their consent.
17912	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The teachers will also not be able to demand students to do pushups or frog jumps if the purpose is to punish the students, according to the reports.

17921	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The situation was almost the opposite last year when the same slopes hosted the Winter Olympic Games in near perfect conditions.
17923	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The Winter Universiade will run from January 17 to 27 and see the participation of some 2,500 university students from sixty countries and regions.
17924	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	A total of 11 sports will be represented at the games: the biathlon, Nordic combined, curling, ice hockey, figure skating, ski jumping, Alpine and cross country skiing, long and short track speed skating and snowboarding.

17928	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Information Minister John Odey told The Associated Press that Yar'Adua landed in Nigeria early Saturday and is "strong and well."
17929	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The opposition has demanded more disclosure on the state of Yar'Adua's health and Nigerian media reported that Yar'Adua spent much of his trip to Saudi Arabia in a hospital undergoing treatment for his chronic kidney condition.
17931	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	But the political opposition has been pressing for more details.
17933	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	One major mass daily newspaper reported Friday that Yar'Adua may have undergone a kidney transplant.
17934	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Yar'Adua has made several lengthy trips to overseas medical clinics since he became governor of a northern Nigeria state in 2000.
17935	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	He also flew unannounced from the country in mid-2007, disappearing to Germany for days, just before April 2007 elections that he won.
17936	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Election observers condemned the vote as rigged and unrepresentative of the public will.
17937	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The government has insisted during Yar'Adua's trip to Saudi Arabia that he has been able to fulfill his presidential duties -- apparently trying to forestall challenges to his authority.
17938	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	If Yar'Adua were to leave power before his term ends in 2011, the official reins of government would be passed to Vice President Goodluck Jonathan.
17939	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	But under an informal agreement among Nigeria's business and political elite, presidential power should be rotated between Nigerians from the north and the south, the country's two main population blocs.
17940	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Yar'Adua's predecessor was a southerner, as is Jonathan, Yar'Adua's deputy.
17941	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Many fear that power passing again so soon to a southerner would raise fierce opposition from northerners, and potentially undermine the country's fragile political consensus.

17943	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 2007-04-03 16:34:15 UTC
17944	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	The organizers of the 2010 World Cup downplayed concerns about safety Tuesday, one day after the head of South Africa's soccer association was injured at home by an intruder.
17945	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	South African Football Association CEO Raymond Hack injured his eye in Monday's skirmish with the intruder, the South African Press Association reported.
17946	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	"We want to express our sympathy to Raymond Hack for what happened," said Irvin Khoza, chairman of the local organizing committee.
17947	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Danny Jordaan, the CEO of the organizing committee, said crime in South Africa was a concern, but sports events in the country had been relatively incident-free.
17948	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	"The issue of societal crime is a matter the country must address but South Africa is not unique and when it comes to crime at sports events, South Africa has a track record equal to any other country," Jordaan said.
17949	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Hoping to ease fears about South Africa's rampant rate of violent crime and theft, the government has promised to boost the number of police officers on the streets by 2010.
17950	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Khoza also said construction on the five new stadiums was underway while work on the five existing venues was on track to start in the second quarter of the year.
17951	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	This comes as a fresh bid to stop the construction of the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town was launched in court.
17952	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	The Cape Town Environmental Protection Association filed papers in the High Court requesting an urgent injunction to halt the 2.9 billion rand (US$392.4 million
17953	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	euro294 million) stadium, SAPA reported.
17954	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Work on the stadium, which will host one of the World Cup semifinals, finally got underway on March 20.
17955	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Approval for the building of the stadium was held up by local residents who questioned the positioning of the stadium, and then by mayor Helen Zille's cautious approach to funding as she sought financial guarantees to cover potential building cost overruns.
17956	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Organizing committee spokeswoman Thumi Makgabo confirmed that papers had been lodged and that the city was studying the documentation and was expected to oppose the action.
17957	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	"But construction and related work continues and has not been affected," Makgabo said.

17960	APW_ENG_20070212.1205.LDC2009T13	Three Saudi border security men were wounded, two seriously, in exchanges of gunfire Monday near the border with Yemen, the Saudi Interior Ministry spokesman said.
17961	APW_ENG_20070212.1205.LDC2009T13	Two men in a speeding car driving toward Yemen opened fire with machine guns on the border guards at the Wadiaa checkpoint on the Saudi side of the border, said Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the spokesman, in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.
17962	APW_ENG_20070212.1205.LDC2009T13	The guards returned fire, seized the vehicle and detained the two men, the statement said.
17963	APW_ENG_20070212.1205.LDC2009T13	It did not give the nationalities of the men in the car or any information on what was in the car.

17965	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Global Food Crisis: A Return to Wheat?
17966	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat is still a matter of debate.
17967	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives to keep former wheat acres in corn.
17968	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Within a year, David Braaten, a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others near completion.
17969	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.
17970	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and oats.
17971	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed, a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of Bismarck, the capital.
17972	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"There's getting to be more and more corn all the time," said Clark Holzwarth, the refinery's commodity manager.
17973	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	At current prices, farmers like Braaten can make more money from an acre of corn than from an acre of wheat, according to North Dakota State University economist Dwight Aakre.
17974	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	But wheat's biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned many farmers against it.
17975	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	They remember the 1990s, when fusarium head blight, commonly called "scab," devastated successive wheat crops.
17976	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.
17977	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements, requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year.
17978	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
17979	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Research might solve many of wheat's problems, but commercial companies say the opportunities for profit are limited.
17980	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
17981	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
17983	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed year after year.
17985	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without significant loss of yield.
17987	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.
17988	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	At North Dakota State University, wheat breeder Mohamed Mergoum helped develop Glenn, a new wheat based on a cross with Chinese plants.
17989	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"It's a joy to make a difference in the life of the growers," said Mergoum, who worked earlier in the international program that developed higher-yielding "green revolution" wheats.
17990	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Glenn has proved resistant to scab, but it hasn't achieved universal acceptance among farmers.
17991	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Don Strickler, a farmer in Euclid, Minn., gave it a try one year but stopped using it after finding that a lot of the kernels cracked when they were separated from the chaff during threshing.
17992	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without other problems arising.
17993	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	James A. Anderson, a plant breeder at the University of Minnesota, predicted that the seed companies will continue to make inroads in wheat country with new kinds of corn and soybeans.
17994	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They've definitely moved into the spring-wheat region with dedicated breeding," he said.
17997	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	There is the nagging question of whether life exists other than on Earth.
17998	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The enduring mystery of who made us -- and why.
17999	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	And then there is this: Why does the foam on a pint of lager quickly disappear but the head on a pint of Guinness linger?
18000	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Answers to questions 1 and 2 are still being sought, but the Great Beer Riddle, at least, may soon be solved.
18001	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Writing in the prestigious British science journal Nature, an elite scientific duo say they have devised an equation to describe beer froth.
18003	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces.
18004	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	In other words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid.
18005	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension -- and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of the bubbles.
18008	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.
18009	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The mathematics of beer-bubble behaviour are similar to the granular structure in metals and ceramics, so the equation also has an outlet in metallurgy and manufacturing as well as in pubs.

18012	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The expected return of Lamar Odom to the Lakers' starting lineup Friday will send one of his teammates to the bench, and the smart money seems to be on forward Luke Walton.
18016	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	In response to separate questions, however, Jackson said Walton would "be really good to help that second team, too" and praised the effort of Ronny Turiaf, who has started each of the first four games.
18017	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"There's some things Ronny is doing that are very good," Jackson said.

18024	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom said he didn't fear that the shoulder would impact him physically and wasn't concerned that he would think about it while on the court.
18025	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I go all out," Odom said.

18033	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Brown received electronic-stimulation treatment near the end of practice, then hobbled off the court.

18037	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's a good time period."
18038	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson has maintained that health, along with the Lakers' chances of being a championship contender, will determine his future.

18042	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	JUSTICES MAKE IT TOUGHER TO SUE OVER FDA-APPROVED DEVICES
18043	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
18044	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the manufacturer of a federally approved medical device cannot be sued under state law if the device causes an injury.
18045	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	By 8-1, the court ruled in favor of Medtronic, the Minneapolis-based maker of a balloon catheter that burst and severely injured Charles R. Riegel while he was undergoing an angioplasty in 1996.
18047	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But a federal district court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, dismissed the Riegels' suit on the ground that the catheter had been given pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration, thus protecting the manufacturer from liability under state law.
18048	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal courts on Wednesday, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority that Medtronic and other manufacturers were protected under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre- emption bars states from imposing on medical devices "any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter."
18049	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But the justices' ruling was hardly the last word on when FDA approval bars patients from suing.
18050	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	They are already considering at least three cases involving drugs and drug-labeling.
18051	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Scalia wrote that the FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each device application and grants pre-market approval only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of its "safety and effectiveness."
18052	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives," Scalia wrote, noting that the FDA approved a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts "even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent."
18053	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The majority was apparently persuaded by Theodore B. Olson, the lawyer for Medtronics, who argued before the justices on Dec. 4 that the FDA and not the courts was the right forum for imposing requirements on cutting-edge medical devices.
18054	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Arguing that "nothing is perfectly safe," Olson argued that it would harm patients and future patients to "discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives."
18055	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Medtronic, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cardiovascular devices, no longer makes the type of catheter used on Riegel, who died several years after the operation.
18057	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Ginsburg said she did not believe that Congress had intended to bring about "a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices."
18058	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	In this case, the Bush administration had taken the side of the medical-device industry, arguing argued that there would be "serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits" if juries could second-guess the agency.
18059	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Allison M. Zieve, the lawyer for Donna Riegel, expressed her disappointment to Bloomberg News.
18060	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"Pretty bad for patients, pretty good for industry profits," she said.

18069	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Rated: PG-13 (fire, explosions,some gore, some computer-generated ghosts, and the obligatory shots of Jessica Alba slipping into something more comfortable)MovieReview
18070	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
18071	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea transplant.
18072	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
18073	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.
18078	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This American version has been directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, two Europeans who've transplanted the story (wanly adapted by Sebastian Gutierrez), the corneas, and the mediocrity (are those death-ghosts from the afterlife or Roswell?)
18079	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	.
18080	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
18081	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But we've been here before, no?
18082	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
18085	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.
18086	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But Alba, with her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan").
18087	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.
18090	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"
18091	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She narrates "The Eye."
18092	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.
18093	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	"People say seeing is believing... Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."
18094	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	All I can see is jeans.
18095	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alba spends a lot of her scenes with Parker Posey, who plays Sydney's guilty sister
18096	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alessandro Nivola, who plays her sight therapist
18097	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
18098	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	as, well, some unhappy Mexican lady.
18099	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.
18100	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But they are here enough for you to appreciate the experience in their faces versus the disruptive purity in their costar's.
18101	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
18103	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's terrible for horror or action or comedy or drama.
18105	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She was never more convincing than she was as Paul Walker's moral- minded girlfriend in the tropical thriller "Into the Blue."
18106	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.

18112	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The plastic explosives were smuggled in bottles of White Rain and Prell shampoo, and in the soles of a pair of black leather boots.
18114	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Some of them never detonated, and are now on public display in Havana as part of what Cuba calls a wealth of evidence against Fidel Castro's archenemy, Luis Posada Carriles, in a string of 1997 bombings targeting Havana hotels.
18115	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	While Cuba cannot try Posada, who walks free in the United States after being cleared of immigration fraud charges this week by a Texas judge, a federal court in New Jersey just might.
18116	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	A secret grand jury is meeting in Newark to decide whether to indict Posada on charges of financing a terrorist operation.
18117	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	FBI agents visited Havana last year in connection with the probe, following up on a 1998 trip to the island, according to two U.S. law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.
18118	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"We've provided American authorities with a lot of information," Cuban Lt. Col. Roberto Hernandez Cabellero said.
18119	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Visiting FBI agents deposed him during the 1998 trip, and while he said he had no information on more recent visits, he said U.S. prosecutors should have what they need.
18120	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The American government has the information necessary to charge Posada," he said.
18122	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was acquitted in the plane bombing in Venezuela, then escaped from prison while awaiting a retrial.
18124	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The ruling thrilled anti-Castro Cubans in Florida, and turned frustration among Cubans on the island into rage over the Americans' failure to indict Posada for terrorism.
18125	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Cuba has called the U.S. government hypocritical for arresting alleged terrorists around the world -- and sending some to a naval base in eastern Cuba -- while letting Posada go free.
18126	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The prosecution never charged him for being what he is -- a terrorist," the Communist Party newspaper Granma declared.
18127	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But lawyers say there's a good chance that Posada will wind up being tried in New Jersey.
18128	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The (U.S.) government is working very hard on this.
18129	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	They are pushing forward on this," said Gilberto M. Garcia, the attorney for five New Jersey Cuban-Americans he described as potential witnesses.
18131	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	By his own admission, Posada has dedicated his life to Castro's downfall.
18132	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He fled his native Cuba after the 1959 revolution and trained alongside other exiles for the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.
18133	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He went to Venezuela in 1967, became a citizen and worked in the country's intelligence services.
18134	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Escaping after serving nine years in a Venezuelan prison, he wound up in El Salvador where he took part in the Iran-Contra arms operation run by Lt. Col Oliver North before he was arrested in Panama in 2000.
18136	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Posada once acknowledged involvement in the Havana hotel bombings -- telling The New York Times that "we didn't want to hurt anybody" -- but now denies any link to those attacks or the jetliner explosion.
18137	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Although Venezuela still seeks his extradition in the plane bombing, a U.S. judge ruled he could not be sent there or to Cuba for fear he could be tortured.
18141	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The immigration charges were always a sideshow."
18142	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. Justice Department officials won't discuss the secret proceedings.
18143	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But in a 2005 affidavit, a Miami-based FBI agent said the Havana bombings probe turned up records detailing US$19,000 in wire transfers from New Jersey to Ramon Medina in Guatemala and El Salvador between 1996 and 1998.
18144	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Posada has said he had a Salvadoran passport in that name.
18145	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	During the 1999 Cuban trial of two Salvadorans in the bombings, prosecutors said Posada organized and financed the attacks, recruiting the bombers in Central America and paying about US$4,500 for each mission.
18146	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Both were given the death penalty, but were later spared and remain in prison.
18147	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The latest FBI visit to Cuba sought more evidence against Posada.
18148	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Cuban-American members of U.S. Congress were furious when they learned of the trip last week, complaining to the Justice Department that any evidence gathered by communist authorities would be suspect.
18149	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"By asking a state sponsor of terrorism for 'evidence' regarding terrorism, the Bush Administration Justice Department demonstrates a shockingly profound ignorance of the nature of terrorism, of its origins, and its state sponsors," U.S. Representatives Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros- Lehtinen said in a statement.
18150	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The only 'evidence' that the terrorist regime in Havana could provide ... would be fabricated evidence."

18156	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	John Alaimo, manager of a taxi repair shop in the Manhattan neighborhood, said the fans only blow hot air around, doing little to keep his mechanics cool.

18162	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	More than a week of high temperatures across the West has raised wildfire concerns.
18163	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	Conditions have gotten "super-dry," said Roger Peterson, a spokesman for the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center.
18164	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	"And it's only going to get drier over the next few days."
18165	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	In the East, the heat spread as far south as Virginia, where temperatures in the 90s prompted state officials to issue a hazardous weather alert.

18168	APW_ENG_20070711.0103.LDC2009T13	In Washington, D.C., forecasters predicted a high of 96 degrees (35.5 Celsius), which would feel like 101 Fahrenheit (38.3 Celsius) with the humidity.

18184	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	In the 1996 Olympic Football Tournament they tied 1-1 in the first round while Germany won both matches in 2000 (2-1 and 2-0), the latter being the Bronze Medal match.
18186	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Germany's Birgit Prinz scored at least one goal in four of the five matches against Brazil: the opener in the 6-1 at the FIFA Women's World Cup 1995 and the 3-3 draw in 1999.
18191	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	The own goal by American defender Leslie Osborne in the semi- final marked Brazil's 100 th goal in a FIFA women's competition.

18197	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	In 1999, China (19 goals) met hosts USA (18) but subsequently neither of them managed to find the net in 120 minutes.
18198	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Germany could become the first team to win two consecutive titles in a FIFA women's competition: no World Cup winner or Olympic Gold medal winner has ever managed to defend the title.
18199	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	For Germany, this is the the third FIFA Women's World Cup Final and their fourth overall (Germany won the 2004 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Thailand).
18200	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Brazil play their first FIFA Women's World Cup Final.

18207	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) on Saturday welcomed the formation of a new Lebanese national unity government.
18208	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	In a statement issued Saturday, AL Secretary General Amr Moussa said he is very satisfied with the establishment of Lebanon's new government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora.
18209	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	The formation of the Lebanese government on Friday is an important step to implement the Doha agreement, which was reached between Lebanese rival leaders on May 21, said Moussa.
18210	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	The AL chief expressed his hope that Lebanon would turn a new chapter in its history to safeguard security and stability of the country.
18211	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Lebanon finally formed the new government following a five-week political deadlock between the Western-backed ruling majority and the Hezbollah- led opposition over key portfolios.
18212	XIN_ENG_20080712.0022.LDC2009T13	The 30-member cabinet consists of 16 ministers of the ruling majority, 11 ministers of the opposition and three ministers named by the president in line with the Doha accord which saved the country from the brink of a civil war.

18214	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush Thursday signed a law expanding legal authority for wiretaps by spy agencies which he hailed as vital for America's security, after a fierce Congress battle.
18215	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"This law will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on our soil," Bush said as he signed the bill, calling it "vital to the security of our people."
18216	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad while respecting the liberties of Americans here at home," he said.
18217	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White House demand.
18219	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure, after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for telecom firms.
18220	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our midst," Bush said.
18221	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The attack changed our country forever.
18222	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	We realized America was a nation at war.
18228	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The program, revealed in 2005, caused public outcry and opponents argued that US privacy guarantees meant the intelligence agencies should seek court warrants from the FISA court to conduct such spying inside the country.
18231	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows them to use any information they got even if the FISA court eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.

18236	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The air traffic controllers union blamed the incident and other recent mistakes by controllers at Memphis on short staffing and forced overtime.
18237	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman in Atlanta, disagreed Thursday.
18239	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	On Feb. 21, two FedEx jets flying in the same direction on takeoff came within 200 feet (60 meters) vertically and three- fourths of a mile (1.2 kilometers) horizontally to each other, Bergen said.
18240	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Big jets in the Memphis area are supposed to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) vertically and 3 miles (5 kilometers) horizontally.
18241	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"Those airplanes were extremely close together and that's just seconds away from the two of them hitting," said Ron Carpenter, local president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
18242	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
18244	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.
18245	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"The controller didn't recognize the error on read-back," Bergen said.
18246	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.
18248	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FedEx declined comment, noting the investigation was ongoing.
18250	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Diagnosed cases of cancer rose by 10 percent in Europe over two years, an increase attributable to the continent's ageing population, the effects of smoking and better screening for breast cancer, doctors reported on Wednesday.
18251	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	In 2006, there were 3.2 million new cases of cancer in 39 European countries, compared with 2.9 million in 2004, they said.
18252	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	For the first time, breast cancer overtook lung cancer as the commonest diagnosed cancer, with 429,000 new cases in 2006, or nearly one in seven of the total.
18254	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Lung cancer, though, remains the biggest killer, accounting for 334,800 out of the 1.7 million cancer deaths in Europe in 2006.
18255	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	It was followed by colorectal cancer (207,400 deaths), breast cancer (131,900) and stomach cancer (118,200).
18256	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	The report was issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), based in Lyon, southeastern France.
18257	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco smoking," said IARC director Peter Boyle.
18258	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"Tobacco control is clearly a number one priority in Europe, not only aimed at men, particularly the male populations of Central and Eastern Europe, but increasingly targeted towards women, especially in Northern Europe."

18260	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Japan's opposition is quietly stepping back from calls on the defence chief to step down over a naval accident that killed two fishermen, whose colleagues Thursday lent support to the minister.
18264	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	While publicly the opposition has not changed stance, its calls for Ishiba's head have cooled this week, which media reports attributed to a request from the victims' family.
18265	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"The local fishermen's union has been consistently saying that Minister Ishiba wouldn't be able to take responsibility just by resigning the position," a fisherman in the victims' village of Katsuura told AFP.
18266	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"He has to take responsibility by clarifying what caused the accident and taking thorough preventive measures," he said, declining to be named.
18267	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Fukuda and Ishiba both visited the village, with the premier offering a tearful apology to Sachiko Kichisei, whose husband and son are both presumed dead.
18268	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Fukuda received a letter from the family, which media reports said asked him to spare Ishiba.
18269	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"I don't know what exactly the letter said, but I'm sure it was along the lines of the feelings that we all share," the fisherman said.
18271	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	But on Wednesday the Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted a senior official of the main opposition Democratic Party saying: "We won't be able to get public support for demanding him to resign under the current circumstances."
18272	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	The opposition took control of the upper house last year and has repeatedly seized on scandals to demand fresh general elections.

18275	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	In the next several weeks, the New York Stock Exchange plans to shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged, the New York Times reported Sunday on its website.
18277	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak.
18278	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The "crowd" -- the brokers and clerks on the floor -- has dwindled to about 1,700 from a high of more than 3,000, said the report.
18279	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade.
18283	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and Hermes.

18293	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"Israel has no intention of attacking any Arab country this summer.
18294	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	We will defend ourselves if we are attacked," radio quoted Olmert as telling parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, referring to Syria.
18295	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israeli military intelligence has reported recently that Syria was reinforcing troops at its border with the occupied Golan Heights, but these "are of a defensive character aimed against a possible Israeli attack," the radio said.
18296	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Committee chairman Tsahi Hanegbi said: "It is important that there are no aggressive declarations from our side that can be misunderstood" by the Syrian leadership.
18298	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said that Syria and Hezbollah, with which the Jewish state fought a 34-day war last summer, feared a possible attack by Israel if the United States attacks Iran.
18299	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"They fear a war initiated by the Americans because they understand that there might be an attack against Iran over the summer, but not by Israel," a senior government official quoted Yadlin as telling cabinet ministers.
18300	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Although Yadlin insisted Israel had no intention of becoming embroiled in such a conflict, he warned that any moves by the Jewish state could be wrongly interpreted by its neighbours as a sign of hostile intent.
18301	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"If the Americans launch an offensive in Iran, Hezbollah and Syria will think the move had been coordinated with Israel and would expect Israel to strike them too," another government official at the meeting told AFP.
18302	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Peace talks between Israel and Syria collapsed in 2000, mainly because of deadlock over the return of the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1981.
18303	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israel has repeatedly rejected peace overtures by Syrian President Bashar al- Assad in recent months, saying Damascus must first stop supporting militant groups in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.

18305	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia on Monday announced that Adel al-Jubeir, an advisor to King Abdullah, has been named as its new ambassador to the United States, the oil- rich kingdom's top diplomatic posting.
18306	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Jubeir, also a former spokesman at the embassy in Washington, replaces Prince Turki al-Faisal who resigned abruptly in December for what he said were family reasons.
18307	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The appointment was announced by royal decree on Monday.
18308	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	"In accordance with a request from Prince Turki al-Faisal bin Abdul Aziz... to be discharged from his duties and in accordance with a proposal from the foreign minister, we have ordered the nomination of Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir as ambassador to the United States with the rank of minister," said the decree, reported by the official news agency SPA.
18309	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The Washington Post had said last year that Prince Turki had been increasingly rumoured as a possible replacement for his brother, Foreign Minister Saud al- Faisal, who it said was in fragile health.
18310	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	When Prince Turki flew home after only 15 months in the crucial diplomatic post, a source at the Saudi embassy said he had left after telling staff he was quitting because he wanted to spend more time with his family.
18311	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is regarded as a close regional ally of the United States, although differences have emerged over Washington's policy in violence-wracked Iraq.
18312	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Prince Turki made a series of speeches last year urging Washington not to withdraw its troops from Iraq precipitously, and repeatedly urged the White House to try to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
18313	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Before taking up the Washington job in 2005, he spent nearly three years as ambassador in Britain.
18314	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	He also spent 25 years as the head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence service.
18315	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	In the 1980s, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Prince Turki worked closely with Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in organising Muslim volunteers to join the Afghan insurgency.
18317	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Prince Turki was named in a civil suit in the US courts by the families of victims seeking damages over his alleged role in financing bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network.
18318	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit was dismissed in 2003.
18319	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Disney teams up with Indian film studio Yash Raj: report
18321	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Disney has struggled to make money in India, which has a vast domestic film market, with its "American fare," but believes that an animated story featuring the voices of well-known Indian film stars could be a commercial hit, the report said.
18323	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	The Journal said the new joint effort between Disney and Yash Raj Films will be formally announced on Tuesday.
18325	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Yash Raj is one of Bollywood's most established studios and the partnership is likely to produce "at least one animation film per year," Yash Raj's chief executive Sanjeev Kohli was quoted as saying.
18326	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	The report also cited Disney executive Shyam P.S. as saying that Disney will start with simple stories mixing singing, dancing, humor and the "in your face" emotion typical of Bollywood-style productions.
18327	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	In another move, Disney is taking US franchises and making Indian versions of them, such as "High School Musical," whose Indian cast members are likely to be chosen in an "American Idol"-style competition, according to the report.
18328	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Disney's overall Indian film production could be ramped up to around eight movies a year if the push is successful, executives said.
18329	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Production costs are usually cheaper in India than in the United States, the Journal pointed out.
18330	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	FOR MANY, EMERGENCY VISIT ENDS IN DISCONNECT
18331	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The vast majority of patients don't fully understand the instructions they receive from doctors when they leave the emergency department, according to a new report.
18332	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Further, the vast majority of those patients weren't aware that they didn't understand.
18333	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at two hospitals in southeastern Michigan.
18334	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers asked patients to recall what their doctors told them about their diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency department care, and return instructions.
18335	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers then compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked whether the patients thought they had fully understood the instructions.
18336	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do when they left the hospital.
18337	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	That is "at minimal, distressing," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, the study's lead author and a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
18338	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If there's one aspect of a patient's care and instructions that I would hope they'd leave the emergency department with, it's ... what they should be doing when they get home.
18339	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This means that those people are likely to have difficulty following the directions," Engel said.
18340	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	It's a problem Dr. Richard Wolfe, chief of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is familiar with - but he said the article gave doctors their first hard data.
18341	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
18342	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do when they get home.
18343	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.
18344	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five - of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem," she said.
18345	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"They won't even say ((their comprehension is)) only very good - they'll say it's excellent."
18346	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	While the study's design is sound, its small size and limited area - two hospitals within 15 minutes of each other - makes it hard to generalize to patients throughout the country, said Dr. Richard Bachur, chief of emergency services at Children's Hospital Boston.
18347	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said.
18350	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Still, the study exposes a vulnerability in a field that is constantly stretched because of pressure to see patients rapidly, he said.
18351	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Whatever strategy people develop for a discharge procedure should be sure it includes real-time communication and an opportunity to ask questions," Bachur said, particularly in emergency departments.
18352	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"That could make some of the concerns in this article obsolete."
18353	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Tips for emergency department patients
18354	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Always ask for printed discharge information - and be certain you understand what it says.
18355	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Making sure you really get what you're supposed to do when you go home is important," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
18359	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Understand that healthcare providers are there to help you, and that you can trust them.
18362	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Ask questions.
18366	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Pick up any documentation related to your care and read it thoroughly.

18400	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	"We're doing our best to remove the contamination as quickly as possible, but it will take some time to clean up the shore because it needs to be done by hand," said Kim Woon-tae, a Coast Guard official stationed in the region.
18404	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.
18405	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	There were no casualties in the accident, it said.
18406	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil -- about 1.8 million barrels -- to be loaded into boats from a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was being towed by a small tug boat, said Kim Tae-ho, another Coast Guard official.
18407	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to high winds, waves and currents, he said.
18408	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Kim said the Coast Guard planned to question the barge's captain to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy weather.

18418	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
18419	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge gamble on my part.
18420	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
18421	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll probably be the last guy to ever do this."
18422	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said, appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads despite the fact that history indicates they work.
18423	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	As Huckabee and Romney sparred for the lead as the Thursday caucuses approach, a new poll showed a virtual three-way dead heat on the Democratic side, with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton maintaining a slight lead over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who has the momentum.
18424	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
18425	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.
18427	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	But last week, the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was second.
18428	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
18429	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign
18430	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	and on the other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
18432	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Madden branded Huckabee's decision to pull the ad but show it at a news conference as "a bizarre display of hypocrisy."
18433	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee told reporters he showed them the ad because if he didn't, "you'd say, 'Where's the ad?"
18435	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.

18438	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	University of Iowa political scientist Peverill Squire said Huckabee's move "suggests the campaign is a bit more amateur than its competition."
18439	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
18440	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	On the Democratic side, a Reuters-C-SPAN-Zogby poll released Monday and conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Clinton at 30 percent among likely caucus-goers
18441	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama and Edwards each were at 26 percent.
18442	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, making it a statistical three-way tie.
18443	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A previous poll last week had Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
18444	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Edwards is pushing a populist message that is finding a receptive audience in Iowa.
18445	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti- Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
18446	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton targeted Edwards during a stop in Keokuk, apparently mocking his animated attacks on special interests.
18447	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's not something you have to do by yelling and screaming.

18451	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as first lady amounted to chatting over tea.
18452	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, she responded sharply to these jabs, noting that she was the first high-level American to go to Bosnia after the Dayton peace accords.

18454	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Last Friday, Obama suggested his global experience eclipses the eight years Clinton spent as first lady.
18456	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout.
18457	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Marion County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus.

18480	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Staring at taped videos of a training session beside the pool, the two girls looked attentive and serious.
18481	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"See here?
18483	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Such was a snapshot of the daily training of the Chinese synchronized swimmer twins, Jiang Wenwen and Jiang Tingting, from southwest China's Sichuan province.
18484	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The girls' hometown was hit by a major earthquake in May in which more than 80,000 were dead or missing.
18485	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The sisters were in Beijing when the earthquake occurred and their families in Sichuan were unharmed.
18486	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"We were lucky, but lots of the people in my hometown were not.
18487	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	We are training hard so that we can have good achievements to comfort them," said Wenwen.
18488	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Training nine to 10 hours in the water during the day, the 22 -year-old are among Chinese best synchro swimmers and will lead China's medal quest at the Beijing Olympics.
18489	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	China has never made the Olympic podium in the synchronized swimming, which was dominated by the United States when it was added at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and by Russia in the last two Games.
18490	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Japan, Spain and Canada are also strong in the sport.
18492	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	In 2006, they dethroned longtime Asian champion Japan at the Doha Asian Games in both duet and team routines.
18493	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Months later, the swimmers made a historical fourth in team and duet competitions in the 2007 Melbourne World Championships.
18494	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	At an April Olympic qualifier event in Beijing, the Jiang twins held off the Japanese duo and won the silver of the duet.
18495	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"We are more sure of ourselves after these competitions.
18496	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	We are trying to improve execution and working on the difficult moves," said Tingting.
18497	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Tingting said she and her sister now eat three times more than ordinary people do and have gained more than five kilos since 2007.
18498	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The added weight helped them to improve strength and stability in water.
18499	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The girls said they were grateful for their coach Imura for their achievements.
18500	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"She is a very stringent coach, but she also takes very good care of us," said Wenwen at the April tournament.
18501	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Imura, 58, has coached Japan's synchro swimming team since 1978, helping her swimmers win eight Olympic medals over the past 30 years.
18502	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	She started to coach in China after the Doha Games.
18503	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Imura said the twins, among other swimmers, have improved markedly in strength, technique and speed in the past two years.
18504	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The seasoned coach said she is determined to bring the girls to win a medal at the Olympics.
18505	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"We hope we can do better than the fourth in duet and team routines in the Melbourne World Championships last year," she said.

18507	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Native American Cherokees voted to expel descendants of black slaves from their tribe nation in a special election that has prompted charges of racism, according to returns made public early Sunday.
18508	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	But a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma adopted Saturday an amendment to their constitution that strips membership from so- called "Freedmen," those descended from slaves once owned by Cherokees, blacks who were married to Cherokees and children of mixed-race families.
18509	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"The Cherokee people exercised the most basic democratic right, the right to vote," Chad Smith, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, said in a statement.

18527	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
18528	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
18531	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It's true," Najat said.
18532	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
18533	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Of all the political problems facing Iraq today, perhaps none is so intractable as the fate of Kirkuk, a city of 900,000 that Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens all claim as their own.
18538	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city.
18540	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the best intelligence.
18541	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
18542	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"He's my boss," said Najat, the commander of the KDP Asaish force in Kirkuk, glancing at a picture of Masrur Barzani, the head of intelligence for the KDP and the son of the party's leader, Massoud Barzani.
18543	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago, rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
18545	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	At some point, the Turkmen guards inside fired at the crowd.
18546	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All in all, U.S. officials say they believe, far more people were killed and wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
18547	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
18548	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One of the Turkmen guards wounded in the fighting was quickly interrogated at the hospital by the Asaish and the police.
18549	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.
18550	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish police commanders promise an impartial investigation of the bombing and its aftermath, overseen by officers from all of the city's ethnic groups.
18551	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But the senior Turkmen on the force, Maj. Gen. Turhan Abdul-Rahman Youssef, fears a whitewash.
18552	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I don't think we will have a result," he said, describing the broadcast showing the wounded Turkmen guard as "illegal."
18553	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs and Turkmens.
18554	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"There is much fear," said Mohammed Khalil, the leader of the Arab bloc on the provincial council.
18555	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"The Asaish are saying they will annex Kirkuk by force, and that is terrifying people."
18556	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
18557	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an outbreak of ethnic fighting.
18559	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Kurdish families were driven out of Kirkuk, replaced by Arabs as part of his drive to obtain a firmer political grip on the enormous oil reserves here.
18560	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing in Kurds.
18561	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
18562	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan region.
18564	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Its fate will be failure," said Nejad Hassan, the senior KDP official in Kirkuk.
18565	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the suicide bombing, that conflict was evident in a dispute about whether to bring a substantial number of Iraqi troops into the city, in a direct challenge to Kurdish supremacy.
18566	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a series of sweeps conducted with the Americans, the Iraqi army has helped establish stability this year in other volatile parts of Iraq.
18567	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But Iraqi troops have largely stayed out of Kirkuk.
18568	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the July 28 attacks, however, Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki ordered in a battalion from a nearby base.
18569	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The troops took up positions in the city.
18570	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
18571	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major Arab security force after the July 28 violence.
18573	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I just saw this continued escalation of force happening," he said.
18574	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Baghdad is expected to withdraw the troops, according to U.S. commanders.
18575	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said he blames all the political parties for inflaming tensions to serve their interests.
18576	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.
18577	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Negotiations here are, 'You give me everything I want, and I will walk away happy,"' he said.
18578	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred."
18579	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
18580	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic, a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be seen standing in a sea of demonstrators.
18581	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	He ritualistically raises his hands, palms up, toward his face, then lowers them to his side.
18582	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	An instant later the explosion engulfs him and everyone around him.
18583	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed.
18584	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One mistook a well-known Kurdish journalist, Yahya Barzanji, for a Turkmen correspondent, shouting, "He's working for the Turkmens," Barzanji recalled.
18585	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video captured the crowd furiously beating Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him!
18588	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	While U.S. and Kurdish officials agree that the Turkmen guards fired into the crowd, Paschal -- who watched the skirmish unfold in a video feed from a remotely piloted aerial drone -- said that the Turkmens did not appear to fire wantonly, and that they instead gradually escalated until they were firing directly into a large and growing mob that posed a threat.
18589	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.
18590	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authorities have sought to play down the intensity of the fight between the Kurds and the Turkmens, but Paschal said most of the casualties were sustained during the riot.
18591	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since last summer.
18592	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds attribute some of that improvement to the Asaish.
18593	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are in direct contact with the people," said Hemin Shafiq, a 24-year-old policeman.
18594	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are more rapid.
18596	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Rifat Abdullah, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan here, said: "The Asaish have lots of sources, and that's why the Americans depend on them and the police depend on them.
18598	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Turhan admitted that the Asaish officers were, at times, more powerful than the police, and he said there were thousands of Asaish in the city, though Kurdish officials say there are no more than 1,000.
18599	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They have a major role combating terrorism, but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties," he said.
18601	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he praised their ability to ferret out information.
18602	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Maybe they have better sources than me," he said.

18604	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	HANOI, Vietnam 2007-06-12 06:00:35 UTC
18605	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Vietnam's first bird flu patient in 18 months has fully recovered, but more outbreaks among poultry are likely nationwide, officials and state-controlled media reported Tuesday.
18606	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	The 30-year-old man from northern Vinh Phuc province was discharged from Bach Mai hospital Monday where he had been treated for nearly a month, said hospital director Tran Thuy Hanh.
18607	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	A second bird flu victim who was hospitalized in late May is still being treated at the Hospital of Tropical Diseases.
18608	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat warned that more outbreaks could occur among poultry.
18609	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Sixteen provinces have been hit since early May, killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 100,000 birds, Tuesday's Saigon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon) newspaper reported.
18610	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Phat blamed the latest outbreaks on virus-carrying waterfowl and the local authorities' failure to fight it aggressively, it said.
18611	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed at least 190 people since it began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in 2003, 42 of them in Vietnam, according to the World Health Organization.
18613	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	GORDON TAKES CONTROL OF PLAYOFF RACE
18614	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	CONCORD, N.C.
18615	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Jeff Gordon has little to prove in a career that has left him among the best drivers to have ever competed in NASCAR.
18616	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has four Cup championships, and his legacy is already secure.
18620	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	So far, he still does.
18621	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon survived a shocking end to Saturday's race, losing the lead as his car sputtered, only to hang on after the leader Ryan Newman crashed with three laps to go in regulation.
18622	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish, Gordon then held off Clint Bowyer to take the checkered flag for his second consecutive victory.
18623	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He also took control of the playoff chase.
18627	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, Johnson came into the race with five victories at Lowe's and an air of invincibility here.
18629	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"This is what we were looking for, getting a win at Charlotte," Gordon said as he celebrated in victory lane.
18631	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
18632	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But he was instructed by the team owner, Rick Hendrick, not to wreck Gordon, and Busch agreed.
18633	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
18634	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the playoff chase into a one-man race.
18638	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.
18639	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who won his first title last year, can become the first driver since Gordon to win back-to-back championships in the Cup series since Gordon pulled off that feat in 1997-98.
18640	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	It appears the two-time champion Tony Stewart will not be a threat.
18641	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of the race.
18642	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Stewart's No. 20 Chevrolet sustained damage on the right front and he dropped back to 28th.
18643	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Although Stewart finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.

18721	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	State Councilor invites Intel to expand cooperation with China
18722	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua)
18723	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	China State Councilor Hua Jianmin said on Monday that he hopes Intel Corporation will expand even further its cooperation with Chinese companies after the American computer chip giant officially announced plans to build a 2.5-billion-U.S.-dollar plant in northeast China.
18724	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Hua made the remarks at a meeting with President and Chief Executive Officer of Intel, Paul Otellini.
18725	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	The two sides exchanged views on expanding cooperation in the information industry.
18726	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel announced it will build a huge new plant in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
18729	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Construction of the plant will start before the end of this year, Intel said in a press release.
18731	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel has invested 1.3 billion U.S. dollars over the past two decades and China has become its second largest market.

18735	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	(Special for CAFS) More river cholera tests results expected in South Africa
18736	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The results of further tests done to determine if the Limpopo river is contaminated with cholera are expected by Saturday.
18737	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	South African government spokesman Themba Maseko told a media briefing in Pretoria on Friday that the department of water and forestry in Limpopo had increased its surveillance and monitoring of all rivers in the northern Limpopo.
18738	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"All tap water audits thus far have tested negative for any kind of cholera contamination, which means that tap water on the South African side is indeed safe for human consumption."
18739	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	he said.
18740	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the provincial health department confirmed that cholera bacteria had been found in the Limpopo river.
18741	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said the national regulation unit was also monitoring areas close to the Zimbabwean border -- the origin of contamination -- to determine the health of the communities of Musina and Madibo.
18742	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Samples taken, which include raw sewage, would indicate whether cholera is present in waste water.
18743	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"Further tests will help determine whether potable water quality has deteriorated since the last round of sampling," Maseko said.
18744	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Limpopo Health spokesman Phuti Seloba said the department is still awaiting the results of tests done to see if the Nwanedzi river was contaminated by cholera.
18745	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said it was not clear when the results for the river, which serves communities in Madombo and Masisi, would be released.
18746	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Maskeo said the government would send a delegation to Zimbabwe on Monday to assess the deteriorating food and humanitarian crisis.
18747	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	The South African government and United Nations figures show that more than 560 deaths and 12,500 cases of cholera have been recorded in Zimbabwe since August.

18756	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The owner of a Saudi oil supertanker hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend said the 25 crew members are safe and the ship is fully loaded with crude -- a cargo worth about $100 million at current prices.
18758	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
18759	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It announced the hijacking on Monday when it first received the information.
18760	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said the ship was hijacked Sunday.
18762	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year as bandits have become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of miles from shore.
18765	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.
18766	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost impossible to patrol.
18767	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25 and remains in pirate hands.
18769	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.
18775	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	We have safety concerns, security concerns, environmental concerns," said Noel Choong, the head of the International Maritime Bureau's regional piracy center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
18780	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Somali fishermen and witnesses on shore said the pirates apparently anchored the ship last night in Harardhere, a pirate stronghold some 265 miles (430 kilometers) by land from Eyl.
18782	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"As usual, I woke up at 3 a.m. and headed for the sea to fish, but I saw a very, very large ship anchored less than three miles (five kilometers) off the shore," he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
18783	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He said two small boats floated out to the ship and 18 men -- presumably other pirates -- climbed aboard with ropes woven into a ladder.
18786	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Vela, the ship's owner and operator, says it is one of the largest crude oil tanker companies in the world.
18787	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19 vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers and five product tankers of various sizes.

18798	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The spacecraft has been planned to be launched at an appropriate time between Sept. 25 and 30 after the spaceship, its carrier Long-March II-F rocket and the escape tower were vertically transferred to the launch pad on Saturday.
18799	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	All the six astronauts prepared for Shenzhou-7 were once trained and tested at Jiuquan center more than two weeks ago when they had a live experience to enter the spaceship and learned the mission's whole process in an all-ready simulation.
18800	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The six spacemen now had moved to their special accommodation to be quarantined and to adjust their psychological conditions for the mission.
18801	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The Long-March II-F rocket, developed in 1992, is said to be the most complicated and reliable carrier rocket in China's aviation history with all its launch mission successfully finished.
18802	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	So far the rocket had sent two manned spacecraft and four unmanned into space.
18803	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	Since October 1996, the Long-March series rockets have successfully launched for 108 times.
18804	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The Shenzhou-7 project will be its 109th mission.
18805	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	According to Jin Muchun, chief rocket system designer of the mission, the Long- March II-F will be given a thorough upgrade after sending the Shenzhou-7.
18806	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"The upgrading work will be finished by two steps," Jin told Xinhua.
18807	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"all its technical parameters and designs will be replaced."
18808	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	According to Jin, the first step will make the rocket lighter, smaller, more powerful and more integrated by improving its controlling and guiding parts and electronic devices.
18809	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The second step will change the fuel of the rocket, replacing its current combustion-supporting material by a new generation of full liquid oxygen.
18810	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	On April 12, China launched a new space tracking ship to serve the Shenzhou-7 spacewalk mission.
18811	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The new ship and its sister, Yuanwang-5 which was put into use a year ago, will play a key role in monitoring and controlling the Shenzhou-7 mission.
18812	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	China successfully put two manned spacecraft into orbit in 2003 and 2005, respectively, becoming the third country to send an astronaut into space after the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia).

18821	AFP_ENG_20081212.0412.LDC2009T13	The new party will name itself the Congress of the People, which was also the name of a meeting in 1955 when anti-apartheid activists laid out the defining principles of their movement in a document known as the Freedom Charter.

18855	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-01-31 19:31:01 UTC
18856	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy, left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating concerns about inflation.
18857	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
18858	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
18859	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep easing.
18860	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
18861	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	At the previous four meetings, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed regional bank, had dissented in favor of a further boost in rates.
18862	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, he is not a voting member of the FOMC this year.
18863	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.
18864	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
18865	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday before the Fed announcement, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 2006 as strong consumer spending and an improving trade picture offset severe slowdowns in housing and auto production.
18866	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said, "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."
18867	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
18868	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues followed up that comment by repeating its belief that the panel "judges that some inflation risks remain."
18869	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
18870	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough waters of a severe housing slump.
18871	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a considerable period.
18872	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	And some are worried that there could be rate hikes in the second half of the year if inflation does not slow further.
18873	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed last changed rates back in June when it pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, up to 5.25 percent.
18874	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had nudged rates up by a quarter-point.
18875	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Before the Fed started raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more than four decades.
18876	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

18881	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Rudy Giuliani's Michigan supporters say they're aiming for a top- three finish in Michigan's Republican presidential primary, a lowering of expectations for the one-time leader here that highlights Giuliani's high-risk strategy of bypassing the campaign's earliest contests.
18882	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Polls show the former New York mayor could finish fourth, or even lower, in today's New Hampshire primary, after a fifth-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.
18883	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	And with Mitt Romney and John McCain expected to begin intense campaign efforts in Michigan Wednesday, Giuliani will largely bypass the state, spending some time and money here but continuing to focus on Florida's Jan. 29 primary and the two-dozen states holding contests on Feb. 5.
18884	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"If we're in the top three, I'd feel very good about that," Giuliani's Michigan campaign chairwoman, Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Twp., said Monday.
18885	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a finish would do nothing, she said, to change Giuliani's strategy, which relies on competing in larger states with more convention delegates at stake .
18886	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	But many analysts question whether Giuliani can remain competitive in those large states without at least some hint of success in the early rounds.
18887	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The last Detroit News-WXYZ Action News poll of Republican voters, in mid-December, showed Giuliani in third place at 12 percent, down 16 points from a month earlier.
18888	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"History says he needs some success before Florida to be successful in Florida," said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which has surveyed Florida voters throughout the year.
18889	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The danger, Brown said, is that the lead Giuliani held in Florida and other large states throughout the summer and fall may disappear .
18890	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's camp has fought against such perceptions for months
18891	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	campaign manager Michael DuHaime told reporters in November that Giuliani's leads in Florida, New York and New Jersey were "momentum-proof," unassailable by any candidate, even one who swept through the early contests.
18892	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Of course, no such sweep has developed.
18893	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa winner Mike Huckabee is an also-ran in New Hampshire, where Romney and McCain are battling in a close race.
18894	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	After Michigan comes South Carolina's Jan. 19 primary, in which Huckabee, McCain, Romney and Fred Thompson all have gotten significant support in recent polls.
18895	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a fractured field is all Giuliani could have hoped for, said Miller.
18896	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"We talked about this strategy very early on: Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," she said.
18897	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"It makes some people nervous, but we've talked about it for months: The thing to do is to win delegates."
18898	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The math is compelling.
18899	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire today will award 21 delegates to this summer's national convention
18900	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa technically awarded none at all.
18901	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Florida will award 114, which the Feb. 5 states combine for roughly half the overall total.
18902	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Miller said Giuliani will try to win at least a handful of Michigan's 60 delegates (30 if the national GOP's penalties against the state stick), focusing on congressional districts where the campaign's internal polling shows it has the best chance to win.
18903	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The winner in each of the state's 15 congressional districts receives three delegates, with 15 more going to the statewide winner.

18906	AFP_ENG_20080111.0552.LDC2009T13	Two-time US national figure skating champ Christopher Bowman was found dead inside a Los Angeles motel room, police said Thursday.

18914	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	A zookeeper needed more than 100 stitches after a 3-year-old panda viciously bit and scratched him during feeding time at a zoo in northwestern China, a newspaper reported Monday.
18915	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	The zookeeper, surnamed Zhang, was hospitalized after the attack Saturday at a zoo in Lanzhou, Gansu province, but his life was not in danger, the Lanzhou Morning Post reported.
18916	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	Zhang was feeding the panda from outside the enclosure, sticking his arms through the wire, when the panda, Lan Zai, grabbed his arms and began biting them and then scratched his legs, the newspaper reported.
18917	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	Lan Zai was transferred to the zoo on July 28 from Chengdu in southwestern China and, apparently not adjusting well to Lanzhou's drier climate, had refused to eat for several days, it said.
18918	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	The panda also had not grown comfortable with Zhang during its weeklong stay at the zoo, it reported.
18919	APW_ENG_20070806.0219.LDC2009T13	Phones rang unanswered at the Lanzhou zoo on Monday afternoon.

18984	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	British actor Damian Lewis is a natural lead as an oddball American in NBC's "Life," which premieres Wednesday night.
18985	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.
18986	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Now back on the force, extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
18987	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis turns Crews into an amusing figure - almost as comic as Tony Shalhoub's Monk, as he pronounces Zen platitudes to no one in particular and constantly munches on fruit.
18988	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	In between bites of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he hates cops.
18989	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is helpless when it comes to all the technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
18990	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations, Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top of a gusher of emotion.
18991	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The guy spent more than a decade in prison among inmates who don't exactly take kindly to cops
18992	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	we can tell that his lightheartedness is but a thin veneer.
18993	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And when he's interrogating suspects, his fury clearly rears its head.
18994	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Is Charlie about to go off the deep end?
18995	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis, with his red hair, pale face, and nonchalant expression, is compelling as he toys with Charlie's balance.
18996	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The actor, who uses a flawless American accent, makes "Life" worth a gander.
18997	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is surrounded by a distinctive cast.
18998	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Sarah Shahi, from "The L Word" and the "Sopranos" episode in which Tony ate magic mushrooms, is likable as Charlie's untrusting new partner.
18999	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Robin Weigart, who was Calamity Jane on "Deadwood," exudes a strong but ambiguous presence as the lieutenant.
19000	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And Adam Arkin is sweet as Charlie's former cellmate who now lives above the garage at Charlie's mansion.
19001	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in 1994, is promising.
19002	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	While each episode will focus on a particular criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually.
19003	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	After one episode, I was already curious about what landed Charlie in jail.
19004	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The premiere is presented partly as a documentary about Charlie, on the occasion of his release from jail, and clearly some of those featured in the reel were responsible for his incarceration.
19005	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not long for the world?
19006	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	For one thing, as good as Lewis is, Charlie may be too strange for mainstream consumption.
19007	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He's a hard character to understand, although I am certain that, ultimately, he is understandable.
19008	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first place.
19009	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or "the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.
19010	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Up against "CSI: NY" and "Dirty Sexy Money," the lifespan of "Life" will likely be short.

19032	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	"I almost fainted by the fear of shaking."
19033	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Flames and billows of black smoke poured from the Kashiwazaki nuclear plant, which automatically shut down during the quake.
19034	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The fire, at an electrical transformer, was put out shortly after noon and there was no release of radioactivity or damage to the reactors, said Motoyasu Tamaki, a Tokyo Electric Power Co.

19061	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Bosnian Serb government apologises for war crimes by Tanja Subotic
19062	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The Bosnian Serb government apologised Wednesday to Muslim and Croat victims of atrocities during the country's brutal inter- ethnic war in the early 1990s.
19063	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The apology came two days after the UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent genocide by Bosnian Serb forces during the Srebrenica massacre.
19064	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The government of Bosnia's Serb-run half, Republika Srpska, "expresses its deepest regret for the war crimes committed against non-Serbs during the war in Bosnia," it said in a statement.
19065	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	It also called on Muslim and Croat leaders to "do the same in order to ensure a better future for all peoples and citizens of Bosnia."
19066	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Republika Srpska would continue to "make maximum efforts to apprehend remaining people responsible for these crimes, notably for the crimes committed in Srebrenica," it added.
19067	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Bosnia's Muslim-Croat government was yet to comment on the apology.
19068	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In its ruling on Monday, The Hague-based UN court cleared Serbia of direct involvement in genocide during Bosnia's war, but said Belgrade had breached international law over the 1995 slaughter at Srebrenica.
19069	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The eastern Bosnian town, then a United Nations-protected enclave, was overrun by Serb forces who summarily killed around 8,000 Muslim males within a few days in the final months of the war.
19070	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The massacre is the single worst atrocity in post-war Europe.
19071	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Its main culprits, wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic, remain at large.
19072	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Mladic is widely believed to be hiding in Serbia and Karadzic in Montenegro or Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia.
19073	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Bosnian Serb leaders had for years refused to acknowledge the extent of the Srebrenica massacre.
19074	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	But under heavy international pressure in 2004, they admitted in a report their forces murdered Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica and that the perpetrators had tried to cover up the atrocity and its scale.
19075	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Following the report, then Bosnian Serb president Dragan Cavic expressed regret and called Srebrenica a "black page" in his people's history.
19076	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	A year later the government commission that produced the report handed Bosnia's state court a list of names of some 20,000 Serb soldiers and police deployed in the Srebrenica area at the time of the massacre.
19077	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In July 2005, Serbian President Boris Tadic attended a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre in Srebrenica to pay his respects to the victims.
19078	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	Tadic welcomed Monday's ICJ ruling that exonerated Serbia of direct charges of genocide, but urged fellow politicians and citizens to face up to the Srebrenica massacre.
19079	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	"It's important that the Serbian parliament, as soon as possible, passes a declaration condemning the crime in Srebrenica without any doubt," he said.
19080	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In 2005, a motion to adopt such an apology failed in the Serbian parliament because parties could not agree whether it should single out Srebrenica or include crimes committed by all sides, as demanded by nationalists.
19081	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The Dayton peace accords that ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war split the country into two semi-autonomous entities -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.

19084	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Tony Blair's office on Thursday condemned the decision to show captured British sailors and marines on Iranian television.
19085	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	"Nobody should be put in that position.
19086	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	It is an impossible position to be put in," said Blair's spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy.
19087	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	"It is wrong.
19088	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover this.
19089	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	It is wrong in terms of basic humanity."

19095	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	Britain angrily denounced the video as unacceptable and froze most of its dealings with Iran.
19096	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	The spokesman said Britain wanted to resolve the crisis quickly and without having a "confrontation over this."
19097	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	"We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner.
19098	APW_ENG_20070329.0735.LDC2009T13	We are simply saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been seized in the first place,' " he said.

19106	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	EU nations sought Monday to maintain their unity in the face of growing tensions between the United States and Russia over the future of Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo.
19107	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	"It's important that we establish our own position and are clear about the need for a strong European leadership but also strong European unity in this area," Britain's Foreign Secretary David Miliband said as he arrived for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers.
19108	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The EU's 27 members have been generally united in their support for a U.N. resolution that would empower the union to deploy its mission to the province and replace the current U.N. administration there.
19109	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Still, some members such as Spain, Slovakia, Greece and Cyprus have expressed reservations about the prospect of Kosovo gaining independence without a Security Council resolution -- unlikely in the face of Russian opposition -- and there are concerns that the EU could split over the issue if it is remains unresolved.
19110	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The conference in Brussels comes just days after the United States and the EU were forced to withdraw from the U.N. Security Council their latest draft of a resolution on Kosovo's future.
19111	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Russia, a veto-wielding member of the council, opposed the resolution on the grounds that it was a hidden route to independence.
19112	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Instead, Washington and Brussels will try to open a new round of talks between Serbia and its independence-seeking province through a multinational group outside the Security Council known as the Contact Group on Kosovo, which includes representatives from the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia.
19113	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The United Nations assumed control of Kosovo after a NATO-led air war halted a Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province in 1999.
19114	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	The world body, which has since then administered the region of two million people -- 90 percent of them Albanians -- is seeking a way to resolve Kosovo's final status.
19115	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, former Finnish president and U.N. special envoy Martti Ahtisaari recommended that the province be granted limited independence, to be supervised by a team of European Union officials.
19116	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	Washington and the EU have backed the plan, which both Moscow and Belgrade strongly oppose, arguing that granting independence to Kosovo -- which technically remains part of Serbia -- would set a precedent for separatists around the globe.
19117	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	"Our own commitment to the Ahtisaari plan remains very strong," said Miliband, who was attending his first EU ministerial conference.
19118	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier proposed that the Contact Group be made more effective by appointing a single EU envoy to represent the union instead of Britain, France, Italy, Germany.
19119	APW_ENG_20070723.0411.LDC2009T13	"Now that we all have to presume that there will not be a Security Council resolution, I think it is important that we don't leave the ongoing process to itself," Steinmeier said

19131	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD 2007-04-26 07:04:41 UTC
19132	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Two suicide bombers attacked an office of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani, leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, on Thursday, killing three of its guards and wounding five, police said.
19133	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The casualties could have been higher if guards had not opened fire on the two attackers, one in a car followed by another in a truck, forcing them to detonate their explosives at least 50 meters (yards) from the office, police said.
19134	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The attack occurred at about 8 a.m. in Zumar, a town that is 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Mosul, the capital of Ninevah province.
19135	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	It was the second suicide attack this week aimed at the KDP in that area.
19137	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	In a separate attack in Mosul on Monday, suspected insurgents assassinated a local KDP official in a drive-by-shooting, police said.
19138	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Across Iraq on Wednesday, 45 people died in attacks by suspected insurgents or militias, including four police officers who were killed when a suicide bomber struck a police station in Balad Ruz, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
19139	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The city is located in Diyala province, which has seen some of the worst violence recently as mostly Sunni militants are believed to have fled to the area since U.S. and Iraqi troops launched a security crackdown in Baghdad on Feb. 14.
19140	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Two days earlier, a double truck-bombing killed nine U.S. soldiers in the volatile province.
19141	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	An al-Qaida-linked group claimed responsibility for the attack.
19142	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, a funeral procession was held in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City for an Iraqi who locals said was killed in an attack by the U.S. Air Force early that morning.
19143	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Associated Press Television News footage showed three large craters in the ground of the commercial area and the windows of some of its stores had been blown out.
19144	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military said it was checking the report, but could not immediately confirm it.
19145	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr joined growing criticism of a 3-mile-long, 12-foot-high (5-kilometer- long, 3 1/2-meter- wide) concrete wall the U.S. military is building in Azamiyah, a Sunni stronghold of Baghdad that has been targeted by mortar and rocket attacks by Shiite militiamen.
19146	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al- Sadr called the wall a "sectarian, racist and unjust" plot by the Americans to divide Iraqis.
19147	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr supporters also demonstrated in Sadr City, chanting "No, no to division."
19148	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Others carried a banner that read, "the building of the Baghdad wall is the beginning of Baghdad's division."
19149	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's Mahdi militia has been blamed for much of the sectarian bloodshed the U.S. says the Azamiyah wall is designed to stop.
19150	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, an al-Sadr aide, Sheik Salah al-Obaidi, told reporters in the Shiite holy city of Najaf that other demonstrations were planned in Baghdad to condemn the wall.
19151	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	He said that if security permits, al-Sadr's followers would like to join Sunni demonstrators in Azamiyah.
19152	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, apparently seeking to shore up his political support, has been trying to make overtures to the Sunni minority while distinguishing between ordinary Sunnis and extremists who target Shiites.
19153	APW_ENG_20070426.0423.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has said al-Sadr is in neighboring Iran, despite insistence by his aides that he is in hiding in Iraq.

19157	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden plans new video in advance of Sept. 11 anniversary
19158	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	first video in 3 years
19159	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2007-09-07 01:21:47 UTC
19160	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
19161	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
19162	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Still, bin Laden's appearance would be significant.
19163	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The al-Qaida leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004, and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his longest period without a message.
19164	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
19165	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black.
19166	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In his past videos, bin Laden's beard was almost entirely gray with dark streaks.
19167	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror messages.
19168	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
19169	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al- Sahab, frequently posts messages.
19170	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al- Sahab.
19171	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Such announcements are usually put out one to three days before the video is posted on the Web.
19172	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours, before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
19173	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
19174	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"They've always gone out of their way to commemorate it," said Ben Venzke, chief executive officer of IntelCenter.
19175	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
19176	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	It's drawn to video releases."
19177	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But the fact that bin Laden is delivering the message is significant, he said.
19178	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
19179	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said he could not confirm the existence of a tape, "and there is no credible information at this time warning of an imminent threat to the homeland."
19180	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
19181	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would only underscore the threat the United States and other nations face from extremists.
19182	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Six years after 9/11, the arrests in Germany and Denmark this week and the battles we fight against al-Qaida in Iraq, Afghanistan, southeast Asia and around the world remind us of the continuing threat we face from extremists and why we must continue to take the fight to them wherever they are," said Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House.
19183	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the U.S. presidential elections.
19184	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
19185	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.
19186	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	His last audiotape was on July 1, 2006, in which he welcomed new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq succeeding the slain Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
19187	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
19188	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	That absence sparked widespread speculation he was ill, wounded or possibly dead.
19189	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	There has been little such speculation since then.
19190	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.
19191	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	He is thought to be hiding in the tribal regions of western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
19192	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	During bin Laden's silence, his deputy Egyptian-born Ayman al- Zawahri has been frequently issuing videos and audiotapes.
19193	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri appeared in a 2006 video marking the 9-11 anniversary.
19194	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	An anniversary video in 2003 showed footage of bin Laden and al- Zawahri walking through mountain paths, with voice-over messages from both leaders.

19198	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The International Rugby Board (IRB) Council said Thursday it had approved a global trial of Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) designed to reduce the number of turnover situations in a match for a 12-month period starting on August 1, 2008.
19199	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The trial will cover all levels and involve 13 of the 23 ELVs, dubbed Stellenbosch after the South African university where the rules were first tested out.
19200	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The new rules were introduced on an experimental basis in approved tournaments around the world since 2006 and now will be rolled out in the northern hemisphere, the IRB said in a statement.
19203	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The Council congratulated the Law Project Group on its unprecedented work over the past two years," said IRB Chairman Bernard Lapasset.
19204	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The ELVs are essentially designed to help promote more ball in play and attractive free-flowing rugby and have already been trialled in the southern hemisphere.
19205	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB added it had agreed that ELVs concerning sanctions not already approved for global trials would be further trialled in a selected elite Northern Hemisphere competition in the 2008/09 season.
19206	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB continued: "The Southern Hemisphere will continue to play under the various ELV programme environments that exist in that part of the world at present.
19207	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	It would be unfair to change the playing environment under which countries in the south are currently playing in competitions such as the Super 14."
19208	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The rule changes came after a laws study group was tasked with suggesting changes to speed up the game while reducing the influence of penalty-kicks which would in future only result from foul play and offside.
19209	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	Other offences would merit a free-kick or scrum award.

19213	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	CANBERRA, Australia 2007-12-14 08:13:05 UTC
19214	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Using the military to track Japanese whalers as part of Australia's anti-whaling campaign could cause a diplomatic rift with Tokyo, the opposition warned Friday.
19215	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters Thursday that he will detail next week how his government intends to gather evidence of illegal conduct by Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean in the coming weeks.
19216	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	A week before his Labor Party won elections on Nov. 24, a senior colleague Robert McClelland promised military resources would be used to monitor the Japanese fleet.
19217	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Rudd on Thursday would not rule out using warships and air force planes to take pictures that could bolster Australia's case in an international court against Japanese whaling in the Australia- declared whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean.
19218	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	"We would not rule out the use of Australian assets to collect appropriate data, including photographic evidence concerning whaling activities," Rudd said.
19219	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Labor in opposition had promised a tougher stance against the annual Japanese slaughter of hundreds of whales in the southern sanctuary, which Japan does not recognize.
19220	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Brendan Nelson, who was defense minister before the election, questioned whether such a military deployment would harm relations with Japan, Australia's second most important trading partner after China.
19221	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	"I would be very concerned about sending war assets -- warships and air force planes -- down to look at the Japanese whaling fleet in terms of how is that going to escalate the diplomatic tensions between Australia and Japan," Nelson told reporters.
19222	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Japan is allowed by the International Whaling Commission to harpoon whales for scientific research and to sell the carcasses commercially.
19223	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Labor argues that Australia could take action against the whalers in the International Court of Justice in The Hague or the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea in Hamburg to add to international pressure against whaling.
19224	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Masatoshi Wakabayashi, whose responsibilities include whaling, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio through an interpreter that Japan "will not tolerate any moves to obstruct our research whaling program."

19235	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The increase in food prices is leading not only to empty stomachs but also empty classrooms in poor countries as parents send their children to work rather than school, UNICEF warned on Tuesday.The higher prices are making families "reduce their budget, to cut down on education and to remove their children from school to make them work" said Veronique Taveau, spokeswoman for the UN children's agency.
19236	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	She added that the organisation was "extremely concerned" by the price increases.
19237	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The impact of higher food prices is particularly marked in poor countries where 75 percent of a family's revenues go on food, compared to rich countries where just 15 percent of a household's income is spent on meals.
19238	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	A drop in school attendance is already being observed in Nepal, said World Food Programme spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume.
19239	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The country is particularly vulnerable as it depends on food imports from China and India, which are restricting exports, said Berthiaume.
19240	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	In many countries, the only warm meal children get in a day is the meal served in school canteens, she added.
19241	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	In Cambodia, the WFP was also forced to suspend its food distribution to school canteens as its local suppliers decided to drop their contracts with the group.
19242	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	"They prefer to sell elsewhere at a higher price," said Berthiaume.
19243	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The WFP distributes 450,000 meals a day in Cambodian school canteens at 25 cents per week per child.
19244	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	Food security has become a major concern in recent weeks as supplies of basic commodities have dwindled in the face of soaring demand, triggering riots and outbreaks of violence from Haiti to Indonesia.

19254	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-01-25 19:14:55 UTC
19255	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Mary-Kate Olsen calls Heath Ledger a "friend" in a brief statement released Friday, the first word from the "Full House" star since the Australian-born actor's death.
19256	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Released by her publicist, the statement, in its entirety, reads:
19257	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	"Heath was a friend.
19258	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	His death is a tragic loss.
19259	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	My thoughts are with his family during this very difficult time."
19260	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police said the masseuse who found Ledger's body Tuesday spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialing the police-fire emergency dispatcher for help.
19261	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	The masseuse called Olsen a fourth time after paramedics arrived.
19262	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	At some point during the frenzy, Olsen, who was in California, summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help, police said.
19263	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police told The Associated Press on Friday that they do not want to interview the actress in connection with the calls.
19264	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Olsen's whereabouts were unknown Friday.
19265	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	A private viewing was scheduled for Friday at the Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan, and Ledger's family was flying to the U.S. from his native Australia.

19280	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	JAILED AND TORTURED, JOURNALIST STILL SEEKS JUSTICE IN LIBERIA
19281	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
19282	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Almost two years earlier, Bility, a journalist imprisoned and tortured by the regime of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, had fled Africa for Boston and heeded a resettlement official's advice to become a Red Sox fan.
19283	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Now he was spending his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather evidence against Taylor.
19284	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	At night he watched baseball with court officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
19285	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I told them we believe," Bility says.
19286	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"We always believe."
19287	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	What Bility believes in most is the power of an independent press.
19288	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In his native Monrovia, he was editor in chief of The Analyst, a newspaper that regularly reported on the violence and abuses of Taylor's presidency, both in Liberia and in the arms- for-diamonds war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
19289	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the most outspoken and courageous journalists in Liberia," says Joshua Rubenstein, New England director of Amnesty International.
19290	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor, who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone.
19291	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."
19292	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close.
19293	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He suffers hearing loss in his left ear after being beaten badly in 1997 during his first arrest.
19294	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His elbows bear scars from the aftermath of his seventh and final arrest: For six months in 2002 his jailers often tied his elbows behind his back until they touched each other
19295	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
19296	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He's regained feeling in an arm numbed by the torture, but his shoulder still bothers him.
19297	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He is a reluctant refugee, the subject of an international campaign for his release by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the US government.
19298	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He resisted Taylor's insistence that he accept exile once freed but acquiesced after a prison guard passed him a note from his mother imploring him to agree to flee.
19299	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was whisked from a Liberian prison to Ghana in December 2002, then resettled in Boston in early 2003.
19300	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He now speaks and writes about his troubled homeland.
19301	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Boston-educated Taylor, the first African head of state to be charged with war crimes, refused to attend the opening of his trial before the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone earlier this month.
19302	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and is expected to last at least a year.
19303	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor was president of Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in 2003.
19304	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape, mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its abundant natural resources.
19305	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.
19306	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He returned in 1984, after being charged with embezzling Liberian government funds, only to be arrested here.
19307	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He escaped from the Plymouth House of Corrections in 1985 while awaiting extradition.
19308	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Staying strong
19309	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility traces his interest in journalism to the unrest that swept his native country after President Samuel K. Doe was killed in 1990.
19310	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I had witnessed a lot of abuses, a lot of murders.
19311	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I thought the Liberian media wasn't reporting what was happening, either from fear or censorship," he says.
19312	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I felt it was necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
19313	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	During this period of chaos, West African peacekeepers managed to ring off the capital city of Monrovia, says Binaifer Nowrojee, former legal counsel for Human Rights Watch Africa.
19314	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Remarkably, in that little safe haven, Liberia went from having no human rights community to having a thriving human rights community.
19315	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says.
19316	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"In the human rights community he was very much a household name."
19317	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility was first arrested the year Taylor was elected president.
19318	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on trial.
19319	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"That issue was taboo," Bility recalls.
19320	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I reported on it extensively.
19321	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	My colleagues said, 'You are reckless.
19322	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That guy could kill you.'
19323	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That was the battle line."
19324	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was released after two days without having been charged.
19325	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
19326	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There he reported on gang rapes, mass arrests, and executions.
19327	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
19328	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Government agents pretending to peddle a corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4 -year-old son.
19329	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to Taylor's home, Bility recalls.
19330	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Charles Taylor introduced me.
19331	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	'Gentlemen, this is the guy who wants to overthrow me,"' Bility says.
19332	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He is sitting at his desk.
19333	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is sitting on the floor.
19334	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He said, 'Have a seat.'
19335	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I sat on a chair.
19336	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A minister said, 'What are you doing?
19337	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Do you compare yourself to the president?"'
19338	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility denied Taylor's assertions that he was smuggling arms into Liberia and arranging for the president's assassination.
19339	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He spent the next six months incommunicado in various prison cells, including one underground hole only 3 feet high and half-filled with water.
19340	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
19341	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
19342	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was sitting in a room with government agents who had been drinking, one, a renowned marksman, poured Scotch down Bility's throat, then balanced the Dewar's bottle on the blindfolded prisoner's head.
19343	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
19344	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"If I had a heart condition," Bility says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
19345	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once Taylor visited him in prison.
19346	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
19347	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He looked up and said, 'My birds.'
19348	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That scared me."
19349	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Through all this, Bility never made a false confession.
19350	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
19351	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His first inkling that his plight had attracted international attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong.
19352	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
19353	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"From that day on I had hope."
19354	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Coming to Boston
19355	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The torture stopped, and for two months Bility's captors worked to make him presentable to the outside world.
19356	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They sent a doctor.
19357	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They cut his thick, matted hair.
19358	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He refused to go into exile.
19359	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
19360	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Once the US government was involved and Amnesty was involved, there was no way."
19361	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Finally, Bility agreed to leave Liberia.
19362	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	American resettlement officials suggested he would like Washington or Boston.
19363	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
19364	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	And he had heard of the Celtics.
19365	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In January 2003, Bility moved to Massachusetts.
19366	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He neglected advice to seek counseling to help him recover from the torture he'd suffered.
19367	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I thought I really didn't need it.
19368	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I was completely traumatized.
19369	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Each time I would see a police officer my heart would pump up," he says.
19370	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"What helped me was to speak about it.
19371	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The more I spoke about it, the less stressful it became, and things became normal."
19372	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Like many other Liberians, Bility is hopeful that President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will bring progress.
19373	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility wants more, however.
19374	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He wants Taylor held accountable not only for the atrocities he committed in Sierra Leone but also for those he committed in Liberia.
19375	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"You cannot build a viable democracy," he says, "without justice being the solid foundation."
19377	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	SHENZHEN, Jan. 10 (Xinhua)
19378	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	Three people remained hospitalized on Thursday in Shenzhen following a mass food poisoning that befell more than 300 factory workers on Wednesday in the southern Chinese boom city.
19379	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	A manager of the Hong Kong-invested company that produced hardware and plastic in the outer Longgang District in the Guangdong Province city, said the workers suffered headaches, nausea and vomiting after eating Chinese cabbage and kidney beans for lunch in the staff canteen.
19380	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	They were sent to five local hospitals for treatment.
19381	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	A health department spokesman said most of the patients were allowed to go home after treatment, but 36 of the cases were serious.
19382	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	Five people had to spend the night in hospital.
19383	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	He said three patients were still under treatment and observation on Thursday.
19384	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	Investigators suspected undercooked kidney beans as the cause of the illness.
19385	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	Experts said kidney beans contained lectin, a toxic agent that could cause diarrhea if the beans weren't heated thoroughly.
19386	XIN_ENG_20080110.0023.LDC2009T13	Undercooked kidney beans had hospitalized 248 teenage students in the southwest Yunnan Province last month.

19389	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that President George W. Bush asked the United Nations to increase its presence and role in Iraq but he told the U.S. leader the U.N.'s operations in the country are limited by security concerns.
19390	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban, who took over as U.N. chief on Jan. 1, said the United Nations would, nonetheless, try to increase its role in furthering the International Compact for Iraq, a five-year plan to ensure that Iraq's government has funds to survive and enact key political and economic reforms.
19391	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban spoke to reporters on his return from Washington where he held talks with Bush at the White House on Tuesday and met Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, later in the day and on Wednesday morning.
19392	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	During the meetings, Ban said, he emphasized the importance of "a strong partnership" between the United States and the United Nations in addressing U.N. reform and global challenges.
19393	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	He said he was "very much encouraged" that Bush pledged continued U.S. support and participation "in all areas of U.N. activities," and welcomed the "very strong support and warm reception by Congressional leaders."
19394	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked to explain why he called Bush a "great leader" when talking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday.
19395	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"I'm wondering why you are asking that question," he replied.
19396	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"In diplomacy, it is appropriate to address any head of state or government with due respect and courtesy.
19397	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	I hope you understand these diplomatic practices."
19398	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his response.
19399	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"President Bush wanted to see an increased presence and role of the United Nations in Iraq," Ban said.
19400	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"I told President Bush that ... the U.N. presence and operations in Iraq is actually constrained by the situation on the ground -- I mean the security concerns -- but we will try to continue to participate and increase our role in Iraq, including the International Compact with Iraq," he said.
19401	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Former Secretary-General Kofi Annan withdrew the U.N.'s international staff from Iraq in 2003 following two attacks on U.N. offices in Baghdad and a spate of attacks on humanitarian workers.
19402	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	The first attack killed the top U.N. envoy in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others.
19403	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	U.N. international staffers started returning in August 2004 and U.N. experts played key roles in helping Iraqis draft a new constitution and prepare for elections, but the numbers on the ground are limited because of increasing insecurity, especially in Baghdad.
19404	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"The United Nations has been and will continue wherever and whenever we can to increase our presence there, but that will be largely constrained by the security concerns," Ban told reporters Wednesday.
19405	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	In Washington on Tuesday, Ban called the situation in the Middle East a "source of grave concern" and said "Iraq and elsewhere needs an urgent attention of the international community."
19406	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"Particularly when it comes to Iraq, the international community should have all possible assistance to help Iraqi government and people to restore peace and stability and recover from economic devastation," he said.
19407	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Relations between the United States and the United Nations reached a low point in early 2003 when the U.N. Security Council refused to authorize a war over Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction.
19408	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Bush went ahead and led an invasion of Iraq without U.N. authorization in March 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein from power.
19409	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	John Bolton, who could not win Senate confirmation as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and resigned last month as his temporary appointment was about to expire, was highly critical of the United Nations, especially its reform efforts, and was unhappy with Annan's performance on a number of issues.
19410	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban refused to compare his relationship with the United States with Annan's.
19411	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"What I stressed during my meetings with president Bush and all Congressional leaders is that while there was a time when the relationship between the United Nations and the United States was not easy, it is time now to look for better days between the United Nations and the United States," he said.
19412	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"And I am quite confident that we will see better days and a mutually cooperative relationship."
19413	AFP_ENG_20070408.0251.LDC2009T13	US Democrat Kerry fights for environment, not presidency
19415	AFP_ENG_20070408.0251.LDC2009T13	"This is about moms and pops in North Carolina and Mississippi, and places where people may be breathing bad air, or getting sick from wells that are polluted, or losing their fish in their lakes," Kerry said on ABC News.
19419	AFP_ENG_20070408.0251.LDC2009T13	"Now I have a chance to talk about these things and people know it's coming from my heart and my gut, not from a political strategist," he said.
19422	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	`Transformers ' trivia: Film legend Orson Welles ' last role was in 1986 animated film
19426	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Yes, that Orson Welles.
19428	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was 70 at the time and in poor health.
19429	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His last released film was 1987's "Someone to Love," but that was shot before Welles lent his voice to "Transformers."
19431	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Author Barbara Leaming spent many days with Welles in his last three years for her book, "Orson Welles: A Biography."
19432	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	She recalls Welles telling her shortly before he died that he had spent the day "playing a toy."
19433	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"That was for him a way of earning a living and a way of trying to finance the films that he wanted to make," says Leaming.
19439	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He died of a heart attack in October 1985.
19442	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Flint Dille, story consultant on the film, remembers Welles' warm, magnanimous personality.
19443	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He came in ... and said, `I'm playing an entire planet!'"
19444	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Dille recalled on a DVD of the film released last year.
19446	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Film critic and historian David Thomson, who wrote "Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles," once described Welles as being attracted to "distorted portraits of grandeur."
19448	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He was joined by Eric Idle ("Monty Python"), Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek"), Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club") and Robert Stack ("Unsolved Mysteries").
19450	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Today, an animated film wouldn't dream of not casting well-known performers.
19451	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"It was groundbreaking to introduce these famous actors in an animated feature," "Transformers: The Movie" producer Joe Bacal says on the DVD.
19452	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Back in 1986, though, it wasn't the payday it is now.
19454	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new live-action "Transformers," which opens in theaters July 3, hopes to reap that in a matter of hours.
19462	XIN_ENG_20080204.0017.LDC2009T13	Many newspapers, including the People's Daily, run by the Communist Party of China (CPC), on Monday led with a front-page story about a warning from top Chinese leaders that weather conditions in the country's south will remain severe and relief work a difficult task.
19463	XIN_ENG_20080204.0017.LDC2009T13	The warning came after a CPC politburo meeting chaired by President Hu Jintao.
19473	XIN_ENG_20080204.0017.LDC2009T13	The Modern Express, a newspaper based in Nanjing, capital of eastern Jiangsu, covered its entire front page with a photo showing an armored vehicle breaking up ice on an expressway.
19474	XIN_ENG_20080204.0017.LDC2009T13	Earlier front page coverage in Chinese media included senior leaders visiting disaster affected areas.

19486	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	GENEVA 2007-06-20 10:20:09 UTC
19487	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The United States should face commercial sanctions worth more than US$3.4 billion (euro2.5 billion) each year for its failure to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that its Internet gambling restrictions are illegal, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda said Wednesday.
19488	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Antigua, which won a WTO ruling last year against the U.S. restrictions, is asking the trade body for authorization to target American trademarks and copyrights if the U.S. refuses to change its legislation.
19489	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	It said the sanctions would come into effect "shortly," unless the United States requests a WTO arbitration panel on the level and scope of the sanctions.
19490	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	"While we realize this is a significant step for Antigua and Barbuda to take, we feel we have no other choice in the matter," Antigua's Finance Minister L. Errol Cort said in a statement.
19491	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	"Until such time as the United States is willing to work with us on achieving a reasonable solution to this trade dispute, we will continue to use every legitimate remedy available to protect the interests of our citizens," he said.
19492	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The move by Antigua comes a day after the European Union told the United States it too wanted compensation for the U.S. ban on foreign online gambling sites.
19493	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	U.S. trade officials were not immediately available for comment.
19494	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Antigua argues that before the ban was introduced, online gambling provided income for hundreds of its citizens and helped end its reliance on tourism, which was hurt by a series of hurricanes in the late 1990s.
19495	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	Last year Washington stopped U.S. banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling businesses outside the country.
19496	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The decision closed off the most lucrative region in a market worth US$15.5 billion (euro11.6 billion) last year.
19497	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	About half of the world's online gamblers are based in the United States.
19498	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The World Trade Organization ruled in December that the law unfairly targeted offshore casinos, telling the U.S. it could keep restrictions against sport betting in place if they were also applied to American businesses.

19500	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said Thursday that the financial markets were not wrong in betting on a further rise in eurozone interest rates in June.
19501	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Asked at a news conference whether market expectations for a June rate rise were correct, Trichet said: "I will not say anything to change market expectations over the next one or two months."
19502	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, the Frenchman insisted that the ECB had not "pre- committed" to any pre-set timetable of interest rate moves.
19503	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	The bank, known as the guardian of the euro, held its benchmark "refi" refinancing rate steady at 3.75 percent at its regular monthly policy-setting meeting on Thursday, just a month after raising them by a quarter of a percentage point to their highest level in five and a half years.
19504	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi to 4.0 percent in June.
19505	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Trichet said that "there was no discussion" within the ECB's policy-making governing council of possible move this month.
19506	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	The decision to hold rates steady was "unanimous", he said.
19507	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, even at the current level of interest rates, the ECB's monetary policy stance remained "on the accommodative side", Trichet said.
19508	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	And the bank would "act in a firmly and timely manner" to safeguard price stability in the euro area, he promised.

19510	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua)
19511	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday issued a notice to call for intensified prevention and control of blue-ear pig disease as the country is entering the peak season for the disease.
19512	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The highly pathogenic blue-ear disease, also known as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), has already killed 18,000 pigs this year.
19513	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice said local governments should improve the emergency plans for the disease outbreak and section off and cease pork trading in affected areas at the time of an outbreak.
19514	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	New vaccines for the disease, produced under the supervision of China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory Institution, have been put into use, said the notice.
19515	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Local governments should establish immunity records for pigs, it said.
19516	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said local authorities should increase studies on the cause of the disease and strengthen inspections and quarantine of pig delivery.
19517	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Pig breeders have been ordered not to kill, eat, sale and deliver pigs that have died from the disease and treat the dead animals and their excrement properly, according to the notice.
19518	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said stricter disinfection measures should be taken in small pig farms.
19519	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Between January and May, 45,000 pigs contracted the disease, but a ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions had reported outbreaks.
19520	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Earlier reports said south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had reported outbreaks.
19521	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The ministry has dispatched inspection teams to supervise disease control and prevention work.
19522	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some areas.
19523	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	It is believed the price hikes will help raise the country's consumer price index, or CPI, to a new high for May.

19555	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Investors loved it.
19556	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Central bankers worried about it.
19557	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
19558	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
19560	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
19562	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
19563	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
19564	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"Carry trades are coming unglued," said Mark Cutis, chief investment officer at Shinsei Bank in Tokyo.
19566	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much over."
19567	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
19568	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Now, the repurchasing of yen has driven Japan's currency up against the dollar -- at one point last week it was up 10 percent over its yearly low.
19569	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That kind of rise could have deep repercussions for Japan's economy.
19570	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
19572	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.
19573	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"When volatility gets high, the carry trade does not work," said Tohru Sasaki , chief foreign exchange strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo, who added that the size of the trade was even bigger than the available data indicated.
19574	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But the volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it does, "the carry trade will resume."
19576	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.
19577	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That view explains, in part, why there was a rush to convert investments back into yen last week: The currency is seen as a safe haven in times of volatile markets, and Japanese investors were with the pack that was fleeing the carry trade.
19578	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Recent surveys conducted by the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan also show that consumers here generally continue to be wary about their economic prospects.
19579	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But others contend that all the talk about the carry trade obscures a shift in attitudes among Japanese investors, who are increasingly eager to seek out foreign investments -- even risky ones -- to diversify their holdings and increase returns.
19583	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"Now we're having some market jitters, so we're getting normalization.
19584	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"We just don't know where normal i+s yet.
19585	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	That's what the market is trying to find out."

19589	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The former Arkansas governor and Republican front-runner in the important Iowa caucuses said Sunday that he stood by the comments.
19591	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press from her home in Leesburg, Florida, she said: "It's very important to me that we don't live in the darkness" when people thought AIDS was transmitted through casual contact, such as by "kissing, tears, sweat and saliva."
19592	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"We have to treat this disease like a disease, and like Ryan always said, not like a dirty word," she said.
19593	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	White was 13 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984, having contracted the disease from the blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
19594	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He was barred from school the following year out of fear the disease was spread casually.
19595	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He died in 1990 at age 18.
19596	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, and the AIDS Institute were sending a letter to Huckabee asking him to meet with White-Ginder -- who declined in the interview to say what political party she belongs to -- and calling his comments "completely beyond comprehension."
19597	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	As a Senate candidate in 1992, Huckabee told the AP in a questionnaire that "we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague" if the federal government was going to deal with the spread of the disease effectively.
19598	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents," he said then.
19599	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Huckabee denied that those words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population, although he did not explain how else isolation would be achieved.
19602	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then, and since, that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through casual contact, but said that was not certain.
19603	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I still believe this today," Huckabee said Sunday, that "we were acting more out of political correctness" in responding to the AIDS crisis.
19605	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Yet he said he would state his view differently in retrospect.
19606	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee outlined his views in 1992 for the AP more than a year after President George H.W. Bush, a fellow Republican, urged an audience of business executives not to fire or otherwise discriminate against employees infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

19621	APW_ENG_20080402.1466.LDC2009T13	A University of Washington professor says a recently discovered fish that crawls instead of swimming and has forward-looking eyes like humans could be part of an entirely unknown family of fishes.

19628	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Authorities in Spain have detected bluetongue in cattle in 47 farms in the southern region of Andalusia, a regional government official said Friday.
19629	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	The councillor in charge of agriculture in Andalucia’s regional government, Isaias Perez Saldana, told a news conference the disease could spread to the southwestern region of Extremadura and the central region of Castile-La Mancha.
19630	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Rules restricting the movement of livestock in the affected farms, as well as in farms found within a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius, would be "rigourously applied," he said.
19631	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	Bluetongue affects affects ruminants -- animals such as cows and sheep which chew the cud -- but not humans.
19633	AFP_ENG_20070831.0165.LDC2009T13	The disease has hit livestock in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and northern France in the past year after previously being confined to countries on the Mediterranean basin.
19634	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Two prominent Republican senators draft bill requiring Bush to narrow mission of U.S. troops
19636	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Two prominent Senate Republicans have drafted legislation that would require President George W., Bush to come up with a plan by mid-October to dramatically narrow the mission of U.S. troops in Iraq.
19637	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The legislation, which represents a sharp challenge to Bush from senior members of his own party, was put forward Friday by Sens. John Warner and Richard Lugar, and it came as the Pentagon acknowledged that a decreasing number of Iraqi army battalions are able to operate independently of U.S. troops.
19638	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's factions, the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, pluralist, democratic government that is able to police itself, protect its borders, and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in the near future," the Warner-Lugar proposal said.
19639	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Bush has asked Congress to hold off on demanding a change in the course of the war until September, when the top U.S. commander, Gen. David Petraeus, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, delivers a fresh assessment of its progress.
19640	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner and Lugar are well regarded within Congress on defense issues.
19641	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Warner was the longtime chairman of the Armed Services Committee before stepping down last year, while Lugar is the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
19642	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal states that "American military and diplomatic strategy in Iraq must adjust to the reality that sectarian factionalism is not likely to abate anytime soon and probably cannot be controlled from the top."
19644	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	At the Pentagon, meanwhile, Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that the number of battle-ready Iraqi battalions able to fight on their own has dropped to a half-dozen from 10 in recent months despite heightened American training efforts.
19645	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Without providing numbers, the White House had acknowledged in its report to Congress Thursday that not enough progress was being made in training Iraqi security forces -- an issue that determines to a large extent when the United States may be able to reduce its forces there.
19646	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Pace, however, also said the readiness of the Iraqi fighting units was not an issue to be "overly concerned" about because the problem is partly attributable to the fact that the Iraq units are out operating in the field.
19647	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Appearing at a news conference with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Pace said that "as units operate in the field, they have casualties, they consume vehicles and equipment."
19648	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal is the first major legislative challenge to Bush's Iraq policy endorsed by the two senators -- and lent a more bipartisan imprint to congressional dissatisfaction with the war now in its fifth year.
19649	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, both Lugar and Warner expressed grave doubts about Bush's decision to send 30,000 extra troops to Iraq.
19650	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	But both have been reluctant to back binding legislation that would force the president's hand.
19651	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The legislation would direct Bush to present the new strategy to Congress by Oct. 16 and suggests it be ready for implementation by Dec. 31.
19652	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The proposal also would seek to make Bush renew the authorization for war that Congress gave him in 2002.
19654	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The fast-moving developments capped another stressful week for Bush and administration figures who have been resisting attempts by majority Democrats in Congress to force a U.S. troop withdrawal.
19655	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The administration sent to the Hill an interim progress report Thursday which said that only about half of some 18 congressionally mandated benchmarks for improvements in the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have been accomplished.
19656	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Earlier Friday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exhorted congressional critics to give the administration and the fledgling government until September to "make a coherent judgment of where we are."
19657	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The day after the House of Representatives voted 223-201 for a Democratic proposal to force a U.S. troop withdrawal by next spring, she acknowledged that al-Maliki's government has not achieved "as much progress as we would like.
19658	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	But we shouldn't just dismiss as inconsequential the progress that they have made."
19659	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	And Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon, a top U.S. commander in Iraq, told Pentagon reporters in a separate news conference via video linkup from Iraq that "there will be consequences" if U.S. troops withdraw too soon.
19660	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	Mixon spoke of a troop drawdown that would be smaller and slower than Democrats envision.
19661	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It needs to be well thought out," he said of any plans to drawn down forces.
19662	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"It cannot be a strategy that is based on 'Well, we need to leave.'
19663	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	That's not a strategy, that's a withdrawal."

19749	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Decades of stifled religious and political freedoms have ignited two trends: an underground radicalism producing militants willing to wage jihad in Iraq, Afghanistan and Europe, and a more moderate, yet potent, religious yearning that can be seen in the increasing numbers of beards and head scarves in cafes and on university campuses.
19750	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nasri brothers and thousands of young Tunisians like them epitomize the intersection of ideological currents and technological wizardry fueling Islamic extremism across North Africa.

19768	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	In 2005, about 300 Tunisians were jailed for religious-inspired militant activity.
19770	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	This year, police killed more than 20 militants in a series of gun battles in a suburb of the capital and in mountains near the Algerian border.

19799	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ayed gathered her pictures, and she and Slimene walked down a drizzly side street and into the gaze of President Ben Ali, whose image hovers on billboards and posters across the city.
19800	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Ben Ali is everywhere, Tunisians say, in their neighborhoods, on the coastal cliffs, at the desert's rim, even in the ancient city of Carthage, where whitewashed homes with blue shutters look out into the haze at yachts and tankers crossing the Mediterranean.
19801	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Violence in the 1980s and early '90s prompted Ben Ali's government to arrest hundreds of Islamists and crack down on religious organizations, including the Nahda movement, whose leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, lives in exile in Britain.
19802	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The government licensed mosques, banned religion-influenced political parties and stripped national identity cards from 10,000 to 15,000 suspected radicals.
19803	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	Human-rights groups complained that the measures violated religious freedom.
19804	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The radicalism today is the result of Tunisia not allowing even moderate Islam to exist," said Ali Larayedh, a member of Nahda who spent 14 years in prison.
19805	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"But this radicalism is not a large part of the Islamist revival we're seeing in Tunisia.
19806	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	... The government is exaggerating the radical threat to justify the blockade it imposes on Islam."
19807	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	A young man with a receding hairline sat in a wind breaker, his hands nervously folded.
19808	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	He would give his name only as Abdel.

19811	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The case became a national sensation, pitting a government wanting to show it was fighting terrorism against critics who claimed security forces were exaggerating Islamic threats and making arrests to impress the United States.
19812	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	"The police said I was a Salafi, a radical.
19813	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	I didn't know what Salafi meant back then," Abdel said.

19838	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-03-31 22:01:06 UTC
19839	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the chest to save a life.
19840	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives -- works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults.
19843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
19844	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
19845	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
19846	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.
19847	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used.
19848	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
19849	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.
19850	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But in either case, "Something is better than nothing," Sayre said.
19851	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
19852	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
19853	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	those "unable or unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
19854	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR.
19855	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.
19857	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only will be added to CPR training.
19858	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
19859	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location.
19860	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving.
19861	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But less than a third of victims get this essential help.
19862	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Dr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was "dancing in the streets" over the heart association's change even though he does not think it goes far enough.
19864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
19865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
19866	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
19867	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.
19868	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's not only the yuck factor."
19869	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.
19871	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	It's less complicated and the outcomes are better," said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
19872	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	One person who's been spreading the word about hands-only CPR is Temecula, California, chiropractor Jared Hjelmstad, who helped save the life of a fellow health club member in Southern California
19873	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February.
19874	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in the meantime.
19875	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until paramedics arrived.
19876	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
19877	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.
19878	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine," said Hjelmstad.
19879	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was just fortunate enough to be there."
19880	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Goodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.
19881	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was lucky," he said.
19882	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Had the situation been reversed, "I wouldn't have known what to do."
19883	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's a second lease on life," he added.

19889	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The hormone produced good results but would have to be used very carefully to avoid inducing diabetes, said Dr. Steven Grinspoon of the Harvard Medical School, lead author of the paper.
19890	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	He presented the results, which will be published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City.

19894	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints.
19895	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the hormone.

19898	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Over the 18 months of the study, stomach fat dropped by 8.5 percent in the patients receiving the hormone, compared to 1.6 percent in those receiving a placebo.
19899	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The team did not study cardiovascular risk.
19900	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial.

19902	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Another study in the special AIDS-themed issue of JAMA found that rifampicin, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can interfere with treatment for AIDS.
19903	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The finding was important because about one-third of the HIV-positive people in the world also have TB.

19905	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Dr. Andrew Boulle and his colleagues at the University of Cape Town in South Africa studied nearly 4,000 people who began HIV treatment between 2001 and 2006.
19906	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About half received the most commonly used AIDS drug, nevirapine, And the rest received efavirenz, both of them so-called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
19907	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB, and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
19909	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting.
19910	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.
19911	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The researchers do not know why the drug interferes with HIV treatment.

19913	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	A third study looked at HIV treatment of injection drug abusers.
19914	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Some researchers have claimed that treatment provides little benefit in this group because they are not sufficiently motivated to take their AIDS drugs regularly.
19915	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Dr. Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia and his colleagues treated 3,116 patients at Canadian clinics, including 915 who were drug abusers.
19916	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant.
19917	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
19918	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.

19921	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Fans who are in town Saturday for Louisiana State's home opener against Virginia Tech can get a glimpse of LSU's latest recruits -- football players and a tiger mascot.
19922	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Mike VI, a 2-year old Bengal-Siberian tiger who is expected to grow to 700 pounds, was acquired in August from an animal-rescue center in Indiana.
19923	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger was placed on view on Sept. 1 in a $2.9 million, 15,000 -square-foot campus habitat equipped with a wading pool, a waterfall, scratching posts, air-conditioned sleeping quarters and around-the-clock care from the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine.
19924	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He probably gets better medical treatment than most of us," Sean O'Keefe, LSU's chancellor, said.
19925	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He's one charmed cat."
19926	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That is a widely held view here, where football and a live tiger are seen as essential to the character of the state's flagship university.
19927	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
19928	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
19929	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Perhaps never before have animals been so prominent on the sports landscape.
19930	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age 17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger.
19931	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.
19932	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting.
19934	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with synthetic materials for its basketballs.
19935	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and the national outrage aimed at the NFL quarterback Michael Vick after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.
19936	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"These are manifestations of increasing concern about well-being and the ethic that if you are going to use animals, there should be a compelling reason," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.
19938	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Twenty-five or 30 years ago, the news media and law enforcement officials might have looked the other way at an athlete involved in dogfighting, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor of sports sociology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
19939	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off and given him chance to cover up his tracks," Coakley said.
19940	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 1992, Jackie Sherrill, then the football coach at Mississippi State, got off with an apology and a warning after he had a bull castrated to motivate his players for a game against Texas, whose mascot is a longhorn steer named Bevo.
19941	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public attitudes appear to have changed since then.
19942	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Louisiana state Sen. Arthur J. Lentini of Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, led the effort in Louisiana to ban cockfighting, in which roosters are fitted with spikes for slashing duels.
19943	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
19944	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."
19945	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The ban takes effect in August 2008.
19946	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a campaign by animal-rights groups.
19947	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.
19948	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Response to the court decision has been mixed.
19950	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	A bill that would permit products made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California Legislature.
19951	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Consumers should not be intimidated by the scare tactics of extremists who have a long-term agenda of banning the use of non- endangered animal products," Warren Truss, Australia's trade minister, said in a statement after the court ruling.
19952	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
19956	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU has kept live tigers since 1936.
19958	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too costly for appropriate care.
19959	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans.
19963	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates.
19964	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.
19966	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"As grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger.
19967	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
19968	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots.
19969	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded habitat.
19971	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Cockfighting is "certainly not condoned by the university," Russ McKinney, a South Carolina spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
19972	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.
19973	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In LSU's written response to PETA, O'Keefe, the chancellor, said that instead of being cruel and inhumane, the school's habitat was "far better" than most found in zoos.
19975	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	foot outdoor concrete enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G. Baker, the LSU veterinarian who is the tiger's caretaker, said in an interview.)
19976	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	O'Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to preserve the exotic cats "will need to be conducted in captivity."
19977	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The campus enclosure will allow Mike VI to roam, O'Keefe said, while keeping the animal safe from injury, poachers and infection.
19978	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU also plans to build an education center to inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.
19979	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least LSU's initial two home games, Baker said.
19980	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	First, it will attend soccer games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds.
19981	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said.
19983	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field.
19984	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.
19986	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	I don't share that religion."

20040	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	Currently, China-bound investment is capped at 40 percent of a local company's net worth.
20041	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	A more relaxed policy towards China, the island's largest export market and favorite investment site, has been a focus of the two presidential candidates.

20043	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	The KMT scored a landslide victory in the January 12 parliamentary vote and the win prompted the pro-independence DPP to amend its China policy, observers said.

20049	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	A Swedish nuclear reactor was shut down on Saturday after a fault was found in rubber pannels in the reactor's housing, the plant's operators said.
20052	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Further tests were to be carried out on the reactor on Sweden's east coast.
20053	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Later on Saturday initial tests on Forsmark 1's sister reactor, Forsmark 2, also led to its shutdown for similar analysis.

20055	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	It was not known when either of the reactors would resume power production, he added.
20056	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The twin shutdowns follow the emergence earlier in the week of a damning internal report into safety standards at Forsmark, made public six months after a serious incident at the plant.

20067	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	LAKE FOREST, Ill.
20068	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In football and in life, Chicago Bears cornerback Ricky Manning has made mistakes.
20071	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, in the Bears' divisional playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Manning was flagged for an illegal block that negated a 66-yard punt return by Devin Hester for a go-ahead touchdown.
20072	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Two field goals by Robbie Gould, the second one in the fifth minute of overtime, propelled the Bears to a 27-24 victory and catapulted Manning into his third National Football Conference championship game in four seasons.
20073	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	That reversal of fortune mirrored what has happened in Manning's life over the past 10 months.
20074	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
20075	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
20076	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After the news of his latest arrest became public, the Carolina Panthers declined to match the Bears' five-year, $21 million offer for Manning, who was a restricted free agent.
20078	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't willing to take that risk," he said.
20079	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.
20080	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was suspended for one game by the NFL for violation of its code of personal conduct, causing him to miss the Bears' 17-13 loss at New England on Nov. 26.
20081	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	When he plays, he makes a difference.
20082	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's been a big part of what we're doing," Bears coach Lovie Smith said Monday of Manning, who had five interceptions during the regular season and added a sixth Sunday in the fourth quarter off Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.
20083	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Asked to describe his interception, Manning said, "I guess it's just being in the right place at the right time."
20084	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.
20085	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Later, while putting a square diamond-studded earring in his left ear, Manning marveled at how much has changed since last year when he stood in the victorious visitors locker room after the Panthers' 29-21 divisional playoff victory against the Bears.
20086	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been a whirlwind," he said.
20087	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Confronting his legal issues was just part of it.
20088	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After taking stock of his life, Manning broke up with his fianc?e, married a woman from his hometown, Fresno, Calif., whom he had been friends with for years, and became a father.
20090	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"The last nine months has been a drastic change for me," Manning said.
20091	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been crazy."
20092	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.
20093	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I'm smiling.
20094	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I've got a kid.
20095	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm married to a beautiful lady.
20096	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Because of the trouble I got in, that's why my life has changed, but I like the change."
20097	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning used part of the signing bonus he received from the Bears to buy a Bentley, but it does not get much of a workout.
20098	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His circumstances have caused him to become a homebody.
20099	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't go out anymore," he said.
20100	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't do anything."
20101	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A gun enthusiast, Manning said he no longer frequents the firing range.
20102	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He has given his guns to friends and relatives until his probation is over.
20103	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He sends his regrets when he is invited to parties.
20105	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	They know I just can't take that chance of something happening."
20106	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
20107	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
20108	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	For starters, he did not need to be out with a friend at 3 a.m.
20109	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Me being out at 3 o'clock at night and partying and being around people that can take advantage of me is just not a good situation," he said.
20110	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Initially I reacted to getting disrespected when I thought I shouldn't have been," he added.
20111	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"OK, I shouldn't have done that.
20112	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But I thought I had done the right thing by walking away, by leaving."
20113	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he was arrested nonetheless and his public image took a brutal hit.
20114	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It was tough, knowing that what happened gives people a misconception of me," Manning said.
20115	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He added, "It took for that to happen for me to learn."
20116	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Since April, Manning has joined the Bears' family and created a family of his own.
20117	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He keeps his relatives closer, having come to the conclusion that they are the best company because they will not lead him astray.
20118	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He flew in some cousins for the game Sunday, some of whom had never traveled by airplane before.
20119	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.
20120	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In his arms, he was cradling his sleeping son.
20122	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A dozen fans, many of them holding camera phones as if they were lighters at a concert, had gathered to pay homage to Gould and were blocking the exit.
20123	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A security guard cleared a path for Manning, who slipped through as cleanly as a knife through a perfectly baked cake.
20124	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Not a single fan stuck to him.
20125	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.

20129	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	MIDEAST HAWKS HELP TO DEVELOP GIULIANI POLICY
20130	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
20131	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
20132	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
20133	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
20134	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Daniel Pipes, the director of the Middle East Forum, who has called for profiling Muslims at airports and scrutinizing American Muslims in law enforcement, the military and the diplomatic corps
20135	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	and Michael Rubin, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written in favor of revoking the U.S. ban on assassination.
20136	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
20137	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative thinking in some respects.
20138	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
20141	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among some Democrats.
20143	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Democratic candidate for president and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said recently that the specter of a Giuliani presidency frightened him.
20144	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said in a recent interview.
20145	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
20146	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
20147	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Yes.
20148	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
20149	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
20151	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
20152	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani rejects the democracy effort as premature and overly idealistic, noting that the policy led to the sweeping victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections.
20153	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Elections are necessary but not sufficient to establish genuine democracy," Giuliani wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs, the policy journal.
20154	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their neighbors."
20155	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
20157	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign policy."
20158	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings, contains a number of main elements.
20159	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
20160	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
20161	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to emphasize trade over aid.
20162	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
20163	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Weakness invites attack," Giuliani warned to cheers in a speech he gave recently to the Republican Jewish Coalition.
20164	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with unfriendly countries.
20165	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
20166	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In a recent speech to the Jewish Coalition, he went further, accusing the Democrats of putting too much stock in diplomacy.
20167	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he said.
20168	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"You've got to know with whom to negotiate and with whom you should not negotiate."
20169	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
20170	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Aides to Giuliani dismiss any comparison to the briefings Bush received when he was the governor of Texas, and a procession of experts -- who called themselves Vulcans, after the Greek god of the forge -- visited him in Austin to school him on policy.
20171	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.
20173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
20174	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill went on to become the campaign's chief foreign policy adviser, and to assemble a team that is united by its generally hawkish views and its belief in using American power to achieve its aims.
20175	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hill joined a number of prominent foreign policy experts in signing an open letter to Bush urging that "even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack, any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
20176	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."
20177	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He sometimes faults Democrats for failing to mention that the terrorist threat comes specifically from Muslims.
20178	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	When Giuliani was asked in a recent interview if he could be viewed as an evenhanded broker when it came to Israeli- Palestinian issues, he questioned the premise of the question.
20180	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think that was part of the mistake of the 1990s that led to the debacle that we saw in the Middle East in the way Clinton was handling it."

20242	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Kandasamy's attorney, Charles Hochbaum, argued that as a "political refugee" and U.S. citizen, his client deserved bail.

20288	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Condemnation of Bush Iraq plan mirrors failure to follow Baker ideas by David Millikin
20289	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Defying expectations, the new Iraq strategy unveiled by President George W. Bush this week mirrored many proposals from the heavyweight Iraq Study Group led by former secretary of state James Baker.
20291	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
20292	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The decision to deepen US involvement in the unpopular war while foregoing diplomacy drew scathing criticism not only from opposition Democrats but also from some leaders of Bush's Republican party.
20293	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"I believe it's a tragic mistake," said Senator Joseph Biden, a 2008 Democratic presidential hopeful and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appeared before the panel Thursday to defend the Bush plan.
20294	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
20295	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	In stark contrast, the congressionally mandated Iraq Study Group, co-chaired by Baker, a Republican who served with Bush's father when he was president, and Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton, won wide praise for the proposals it submitted in early December.
20296	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The report focussed on shifting responsibility for ending the spiralling sectarian violence in Iraq from US to Iraqi forces so American troops could begin withdrawing by early next year.
20297	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and radicalization across the region.
20298	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.
20299	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"From where I sit, Madam Secretary, you are not listening to the American people, you are not listening to the military ... you are not listening to the Iraq Study Group," Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer fumed at Rice Thursdsay.
20300	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The strategy released by Bush however reflected key elements of the Baker outline, including a need to boost training of Iraqi forces by "embedding" more US advisors and making US support conditional on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government meeting "benchmarks" for achieving security and political reconciliation.
20301	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.
20302	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice met another of the group's main recommendations Thursday when she named a "czar" to oversee a new, more decentralised push for economic reconstruction and job creation in Iraq.
20303	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	She is also due to leave Friday for a tour of the Middle East that will include talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on their moribund peace process and efforts to rally moderate Arab allies to Iraq's aid.
20304	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	But at the same time, Bush's top diplomat made clear that diplomacy involving Syria and Iran remained out of the question.
20305	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over neighboring Lebanon.
20306	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"That's not diplomacy, that's extortion," she said.
20307	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	A former State Department official who was instrumental in the work of the Iraq Study Group downplayed the differences with Bush's final plan and suggested the Democrats who now control Congress could still force the president's hand on the missing elements.
20308	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Its not a repudiation -- there are a lot of things in the plan that come directly from the Iraq Study Group," said the former diplomat, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the group.

20312	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Venezuela's oil industry wants foreign partners to help tap its vast resources, but they need not come knocking if they want to call the shots, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday in Houston.
20314	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	But those who stay -- or come later -- will do so with Venezuela's government-controlled oil company in charge, Alvarez told the Houston Chronicle editorial board.
20315	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that rule," he said.
20316	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Later, during an appearance at a Greater Houston Partnership luncheon, Alvarez was asked what Chavez wants to hear from the new U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
20317	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We are ready to respect Venezuela," Alvarez replied.
20318	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Patrick Duddy, a senior State Department official, recently was named to succeed outgoing ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield.
20320	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said he has not encountered hostility from Americans despite Washington's chilly relations with Chavez, a socialist who once likened President Bush to the devil.
20321	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
20322	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he has found Americans open to discussions about differences and common interests involving the United States and the South American nation.
20323	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	In May, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took over operations of major oil projects that had been run by Houston-based ConocoPhillips, Irving-based Exxon Mobil, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp. and Paris-based Total.
20325	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.
20326	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Last month, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil refused to accept new working terms for their Venezuelan operations and walked away.
20327	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	PDVSA absorbed their stakes, and the companies are negotiating compensation for what they gave up.
20328	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chevron and Total agreed to stay on as PDVSA's minority partners.
20329	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	London-based BP and Norway's Statoil, which already were minority partners, also agreed to stay.
20330	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Analysts have valued the combined projects PDVSA took over at $25 billion to $30 billion.
20331	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	ConocoPhillips has announced plans to write off the entire $4.5 billion value of its Venezuelan assets in its second quarter results, but Exxon Mobil hasn't revealed its plans.
20332	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
20333	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said in the meeting with the Chronicle that he isn't worried that the takeovers will chill future investment or participation from foreign companies.
20334	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	While ConocoPhillips and Exxon left, others remain, he said, and more have been invited to explore and develop the Orinoco region, including Russia's Lukoil, Brazil's Petrobras, China's CNPC and India's ONGC.
20336	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and Hispanics.
20337	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
20338	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said the aftermath may be more complicated than Alvarez suggests.
20339	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts could change in midstream.
20341	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.
20343	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, Esteruelas noted that in mid-May, the Venezuelan government said it might take over 18 oil rigs now operated by oil service companies and create a PDVSA subsidiary to tighten control of drilling operations throughout the country.
20344	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	That could prompt oil service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
20345	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
20346	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Its American assets -- notably five refineries run by its Houston-based subsidiary, Citgo -- could be targeted for seizure to compensate ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.
20347	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility.
20348	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
20349	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.
20350	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He also said that during his visit, he would meet privately with officials of Chevron and Citgo.
20351	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He had no meetings scheduled with ConocoPhillips or Exxon Mobil.

20353	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	DUBLIN, Ireland 2008-07-24 18:42:40 UTC
20354	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp.
20355	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	PLC. reported narrowing second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
20356	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Revenues rose 30 percent to US$245.6 million (euro156.6 million) in the April-June quarter, chiefly because of Tysabri, which is produced and distributed in alliance with U.S. drugmaker Biogen Idec Inc.
20357	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan cut its losses nearly in half to US$71.5 million (euro45.6 million), compared to a US$141.1 million loss in the second quarter of 2007.
20358	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Executives said they hoped to report narrower full-year losses and a 2009 return to profit -- which would be Elan's first since the company nearly went bankrupt amid an accounting scandal in 2002.
20359	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The fate of Ireland's largest pharmaceutical company rests with Tysabri, which appears finally on the verge of attaining Elan's ambition of a "blockbuster" drug that exceeds US$1 billion (the equivalent of euro650,000) in annual sales.
20360	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
20361	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke said Elan hoped to reach 100,000 Tysabri customers by the end of 2010, while current projections pointed to 90,000.
20363	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Three clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called PML, and two died.
20364	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
20365	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.

20369	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
20370	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He said close to 7 percent were already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20 percent would be.
20371	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
20373	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the drug today.

20390	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
20391	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In his appearance on Thursday, Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm, will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- and its potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady hand and business experience.
20392	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
20393	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
20394	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the council.
20395	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	His staff is drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two.
20397	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk.
20398	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
20399	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996.
20400	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
20401	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"Democracy," he added, "is bigger than any one person."
20402	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
20403	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes.
20404	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call for abolishing term limits.
20405	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The New York Post and the New York Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
20406	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
20407	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
20408	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his spokesman did not return several e-mail messages and telephone calls.
20409	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
20410	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor," said the person who has advised the mayor in the past.
20411	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"It's not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it."
20412	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
20413	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
20414	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty, that they may not remain for a full third term.
20415	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
20416	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
20417	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
20418	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg took pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms, traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and appearing on "Meet the Press" to field questions about the financial crisis.
20419	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
20420	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"He has the confidence of the business community and the executive ability to run the city," said Steve Ross, the chief executive of Related Cos., a major developer in the city.
20421	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This is a good time for him to do this.
20422	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People are scared."
20423	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
20428	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term- limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two- thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- a third term.
20429	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
20430	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.
20434	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's plan would have an especially deep impact on the next mayor's race.
20435	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Two candidates for mayor next year, Thompson, the comptroller, and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, would be forced from office under term limits.
20436	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
20437	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
20439	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through a spokesman that "It's illegal to run for a third term."
20440	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
20441	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be used against him in the next mayoral campaign.
20442	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"The mayor has carefully crafted an image of always acting in the public interest, but this act of circumventing the will of the voters now calls that into question," said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group.

20473	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Hakiwai, one of the group that accompanied the remains from the Field Museum, said the museum had "made the right decision on the right grounds -- it was the right thing to do."

20535	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	The strike by baggage handlers at the Brussels International Airport entered its second day Tuesday.
20536	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	Scores of arriving and departing flights have again been cancelled or delayed.
20538	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	The baggage handlers are protesting against high work pressure.
20539	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	They say tasks that used to be carried out by five people now have to be done by only three.
20540	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	The management of baggage handling company Aviapartner has offered a second proposal on improvement of working conditions to the workers and it again was rejected by the trade unions.
20541	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	However, the unions have agreed to hold a referendum among the workers on the proposal Tuesday afternoon.
20542	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	At Flightcare, another baggage handling company, the negotiations between the management and labor collapsed last night.
20543	XIN_ENG_20080812.0211.LDC2009T13	Some airlines have been transporting their passengers by bus to other airports nearby.

20554	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-05-25 15:17:26 UTC
20555	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	Germany, which holds the European Union presidency, voiced concern Friday over Iran's recent human rights record, citing the imposition by force of stricter dress codes and the "worsening situation" of minorities, among other worries.
20556	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	The 27-nation EU "is particularly troubled by the recent wave of arrests of civil society and women's rights activists," Germany said in a statement on behalf of the bloc.
20557	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	"Teachers, students, union members, scholars and journalists exercising their right to freely express their opinion are facing constant intimidation, and stricter dress codes for men and women are being imposed by force," it added.
20558	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	Hard-liners in Iran, which is at odds with the West over its nuclear program, have taken advantage of the confrontation to crack down on opponents and launch morality campaigns like one in which women were arrested for not meeting Islamic dress codes.
20559	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	Germany's statement said that "the EU also wishes to draw attention to the worsening of the situation of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran, in particular to the plight of the Baha'i, who are excluded from public life, discriminated against and harassed."
20561	APW_ENG_20070525.1055.LDC2009T13	EU countries have abolished the death penalty.

20564	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The differences between No. 1 UCLA and No. 12 Western Kentucky were far greater than their seedings.
20565	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Each program entered the West Region semifinals of the NCAA tournament with starkly different styles.
20566	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated on running and trapping.
20567	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
20568	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.
20569	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA survived scary second- half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with an 88-78 victory.
20570	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA (34-3) is on the cusp of becoming the third team to reach a Final Four in three consecutive years since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.
20571	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins would join Michigan State and Duke.
20572	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
20573	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	For Western Kentucky (29-7), the lopsided loss ends a dazzling season that saw the Hilltoppers storm through the Sun Belt tournament and into America's consciousness when Ty Rogers' 3-point heave topped Drake in overtime in the first round.
20574	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
20575	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-8 sophomore forward James Keefe finished with 18 points.
20576	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Keefe's career high coming into the game was eight.
20577	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Kevin Love scored a career-high 29 points and added 14 rebounds.
20578	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But UCLA struggled mightily in the second half against the Hilltoppers' full-court pressure, which allowed Western Kentucky to creep within four points and perpetuate UCLA's reputation as a team that can always make a game close.
20579	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That's something that could haunt the Bruins as they advance.
20580	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky cut the UCLA lead to 61-57 with less than seven minutes remaining when Tyrone Brazelton blew past Darren Collison for a layup.
20581	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The basket capped a personal 8-0 run by Brazelton.
20582	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA answered with a basket from Love and UCLA ended any notion of a threat when Josh Shipp hit a line drive 3-point shot with 4 minutes 33 seconds remaining to spread the lead back out to 68-59.
20584	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins built their halftime lead with inside dominators.
20585	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Love had 15 first-half points while Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for seven points in 10 minutes.
20586	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up, leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in anticipation of their game against Xavier.
20587	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That game will be an intriguing matchup.
20588	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA will enter as a heavy favorite despite Xavier's 30-6 record and having a list of victories this season that includes Indiana, Virginia, Auburn, Georgia, Purdue and West Virginia.
20589	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	And those are only the ones from outside the Atlantic 10.
20590	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut defense.
20591	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked No. 5 nationally in scoring defense.
20592	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins yield only 58 points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
20593	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is the erratic play of Collison, the point guard.
20594	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He fouled out with four points.
20595	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He turned the ball over four times and had only one assist in the Round of 32 against Texas A&amp

20597	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	M, a narrow Bruins victory.
20598	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.

20604	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
20605	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	With world bullion prices hitting new highs, gold futures made a strong debut on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) on Wednesday.
20606	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract offers China a chance to become a key player in the global gold market.
20607	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It could also be a hedging tool for gold producers and a means to absorb excess liquidity, analysts said.
20608	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The key contract for June delivery was the first to take off, surging 9.98 percent to 230.95 yuan (about 31.65 U.S. dollars) per gram.
20609	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	This was followed by the daily limit rise of other contracts for July-to-December delivery.
20610	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Seven contracts were traded, with the benchmark price set at 209.99 yuan per gram by the SFE a day earlier, lower than world prices.
20611	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract size was set at 1,000 grams, larger than the originally expected 300 grams, to discourage individual investors who lacked the ability to handle the risk.
20612	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Analysts said they believed investors would need at least 24,000 yuan to secure a futures contract, as most futures brokers would ask for a 12 percent cash deposit for each contract.
20613	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The most active June contract closed the first trading day at 223.3 yuan per gram, up 6.34 percent, with a turnover of 23.2 billion yuan, according to the SFE website.
20614	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The total turnover of the seven contracts was registered at more than 27 billion yuan for the day.
20615	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	All futures contracts finished the day higher, between 223 yuan and 228 yuan, slipping slightly after peaking at 230.99 yuan.
20616	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.
20617	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Global prices jumped more than 30 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979.
20618	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold prices climbed more than 2 percent on Tuesday against strong oil prices and a weakening U.S. currency.
20619	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	A troy ounce of gold for February delivery added 18.3 U.S. dollars to settle at 880.30 U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
20620	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the launch of gold futures trading.
20621	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
20622	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE, one of China's major futures trading venues, previously traded copper, aluminum, zinc, natural rubber and fuel futures.
20624	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Live pig futures will also be launched to help stabilize pork prices.
20625	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	HEDGING PRICES VS INVESTMENT TOOLS
20626	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Shang Fulin, CSRC chairman, stressed the financial nature of the precious metal and called for "joint efforts for the stable operation" of the new product at the launching ceremony in Shanghai.
20627	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said gold futures would improve the country's domestic gold market and pricing mechanism and provide options for financial institutions, gold producers and consumers to protect against market risk.
20628	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also further develop the nascent futures industry.
20629	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Most new futures investors would be institutions seeking a hedging tool," said Zhang Yingying, a Galaxy Futures Broker gold analyst.
20630	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	So far, however, the SFE has listed only four members for futures trading, all of which are large Chinese gold producers.
20631	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	She said, "the contract size could limit participation by individual investors, but in the long run both institutions and individuals would play an equal role."
20632	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zhao Yuanlin, a Guotai Jun'an Futures analyst, said the brokerage had received numerous inquiries about gold futures from individual stock investors recently.
20633	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.
20634	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, "I would first offer risk education to veteran stock investors, since even they lacked the experience for riskier futures trading," Zhao told Xinhua.
20635	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Chinese investors, who saw the key stock index nearly double last year, have shown strong enthusiasm for the new investment product.
20636	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, the regulators were trying to discourage such clients, fearing that some might take on risks they couldn't handle.
20637	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE said earlier that it would impose strict risk controls on gold futures.
20638	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also set a minimum margin requirement of 7 percent of the contract value.
20639	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
20641	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	RISING STAR IN WORLD MARKET?
20642	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"The trading volume of Chinese futures would likely expand quickly and could soon rank top among global exchanges, even outstripping NYMEX in the long run," a senior official at the exchange told Xinhua's International Herald Leader reporter.
20643	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zheng Xueqin, a Chicago Board Options Exchange senior counselor, agreed that "Shanghai could emerge as the third center of world gold trade, after New York and London."
20644	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said, "the SFE would first become a center for Asian trade, given the country's large reserves and consumption and the traditional Chinese love of gold."
20645	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Hong Kong and Tokyo were two major Asian trading centers.
20646	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Domestic analysts expressed confidence about the contract's prospects, citing robust investment registered in simulated trade between Jan. 2-8.
20647	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China was the world's third largest gold producer in 2006 after South Africa and the United States.
20648	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold consumption by the country's manufacturing sector was about 9.2 percent of the global total, according to official data.
20649	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Sun Zhaoxue, China Gold Association head, said on Wednesday that the country's gold output reached 270 tons in 2007, only 20 tons short of South Africa, the world's largest producer.
20651	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Gold futures could also provide a reservoir to absorb the country's excess liquidity, a major concern of the government amid the anticipated strong appreciation of the currency, which had already pushed asset prices up," said Zheng Runxiang, a senior gold investment analyst.
20652	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said that the new futures market could thus help the country's tighter monetary policy and alleviate inflation pressure.
20653	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Trade at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the country's spot market, was 1,828 tons last year, with a total value of 316.5 billion yuan.
20655	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The estimated figure would exceed the combined market capitalization of the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

20666	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush, on a surprise visit to Iraq Monday, said a reduction in combat troops was possible but sniped at "nervous" US politicians ahead of a showdown with Congress.
20668	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	He convened a meeting of his "war council" with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders just days before US commander General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker report to Congress on the progress of Bush's troop "surge" strategy.
20669	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker tell me if the kind of success we are now seeing (in Anbar) continues, it is possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces," Bush said before leaving Iraq a few hours later for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Australia.
20672	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"This is the last big gathering of the president's military advisors and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on the way forward," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.
20673	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The White House is to make a formal report to Congress by September 15 aimed at persuading US lawmakers to continue funding the Iraq war, four and a half bloody years since the US-led invasion of 2003.
20674	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Staging a surprise detour from his trip to Sydney, Bush arrived at the Al-Asad air base in Anbar along with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley.
20675	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Waiting for him were US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Fallon, the commander of US forces in the Middle East, and Petraeus.
20676	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he sees as improved security.
20677	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"So the issue is are we at the point where we can continue to make security progress with X number of forces?"
20679	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
20680	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003.
20681	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Opposition Democrats who control the House of Representatives and Senate have been pushing for months to force a deadline for US troops to leave.
20682	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But Bush and his generals have argued for time to make the troop surge work after the US military deployed 28,500 extra soldiers in February to try and end the violence.
20683	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
20684	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the conditions on the ground, not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media," the president said.
20685	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
20686	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
20687	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Gates said the general view was that security has improved not just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of the surge.
20688	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some (areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape," Gates told reporters.
20689	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But security officials said that shortly before Bush's arrival, two car bombs went off in Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi, killing four people and wounding 10.
20690	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, police found 15 corpses of men shot dead.
20691	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The president's visit came just hours after 500 British troops slipped out of their last base in Basra Palace under cover of darkness, leaving behind a city in the grip of a brutal militia turf war.
20693	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The evacuation of the troops to a desert airbase west of Basra paves the way for a full British handover of security in the region to Iraqi authorities, which could take place in the autumn.
20694	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	There are about 5,500 British troops in Iraq, most based in and around Basra, although that number is set to drop to around 5,000 by the end of the year.
20695	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Gordon Brown stressed that British forces stood ready to "re- intervene" in Basra if the security situation demanded, telling BBC radio: "This is a pre-planned and this is an organised move."
20696	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Locals cheered the withdrawal, despite warnings the city could descend further into chaos.
20697	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"We are happy to be rid of the British.
20698	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	They were harassing us in the streets and raided our houses and arrested our sons," said army officer Sadoun Hami, demanding they quit the Basra area altogether.
20699	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The United States and Britain have been at odds over Iraq recently, with US officials voicing frustration at deteriorating security in Basra.
20700	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the British army during the invasion, on Saturday branded Washington's post-invasion policy "intellectually bankrupt."

20703	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar climbed to eight-week highs against the euro and seven-month highs against the yen Wednesday as fears of a global slowdown helped the dollar continue its rally.
20704	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar rose to 109.54 Japanese yen from 108.17 yen late Tuesday.
20705	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile the 15-nation euro dropped to $1.5420 from $1.5473 after going as low as $1.5396, and the British pound sank to $1.9475 from $1.9562 ahead of interest-rate decisions by the European Central Bank and Bank of England Thursday.
20706	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar gained as gloomy economic signs came in from abroad.
20707	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Japanese government said a monthly index of business conditions was worsening, setting off the yen decline, said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
20708	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the German government said industrial orders dropped unexpectedly in June, with orders from elsewhere in Europe leading a decline that underlined pessimism about the outlook for the continent's biggest economy.
20709	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Orders dropped 2.9 percent in June, following a 1.4 percent drop in May, the Economy Ministry said.
20710	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Ashraf Laidi, a currency strategist at CMC Markets, said the decline, the seventh in a row, along with a leaked report by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung claiming that German second-quarter GDP likely shrunk by 1 percent, would weigh on the European Central Bank at its Thursday meeting.
20711	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"The hawkish rancor of (ECB President) Jean-Claude Trichet is likely going to be toned down considerably," Woolfolk said.
20712	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Rate- hike talk will be cast aside, and Britain may signal future rate cuts, he said.
20713	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"The ECB and Bank of England don't have much to cheer about."
20714	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The ECB is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25 percent, given the 4.1 percent inflation in the 15-nation euro zone, while the BoE is expected to keep its rate steady as well, at 5 percent.
20715	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve left the benchmark U.S. federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday.
20717	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Talk of the Fed hiking rates had driven the dollar higher over the past three weeks, but Tuesday's announcement hinted that a weak economy was still a risk, and many analysts talked down the chance of a rate hike.
20718	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Higher interest rates abroad can push down the dollar, as investors transfer their funds from American assets to overseas, where they can get higher returns on their investments.
20719	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, oil futures touched below $118 a barrel Wednesday, while gold dropped below $880 an ounce.
20720	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Commodity-exporting countries whose currencies were buoyed as long as commodities shot higher, such as Canada and Australia, have seen the value of their dollars eroded.
20722	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Australian dollar, meanwhile, fell to its lowest point in more than four months, to 90.62 U.S. cents.

20727	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. - This is familiar territory for the Panthers.
20728	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	With 10 weeks left in the season, they're 12th in the East and need to make up ground to reach the playoffs.
20730	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers say they are determined to end their agonizing playoff drought.
20731	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	But some observers think the Panthers haven't exhibited enough determination to reach the post-season for the first time since April 2000.
20732	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	To put it more bluntly, some critics think they are soft.
20735	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Winning isn't easy.
20736	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You've got to make up your mind you're going to do whatever it takes to get there and play like that every night."
20738	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Despite their uneven play - they have won only four of their past 14 games - they are only three points out of the Southeast Division lead and five out of eighth place.
20739	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's good that we're still there
20740	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I'm more optimistic than years before," captain Olli Jokinen said.
20741	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"But there's way too many 'ifs' and 'buts.'
20742	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Now it's time to go out and do it."
20743	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	That is what NHL Network analyst Gary Green would like to see.
20744	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack grittiness."
20745	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I'm not talking about having enforcers
20746	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	it's more banging in the corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their opponents," Green said.
20747	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They won't make it if they don't find a way to get that."
20748	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1 when trailing after the first period.
20749	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"The games they've won they've had the lead from the first period on," Panthers announcer Denis Potvin said.
20750	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They've got to be winning third periods.
20751	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You can go into the third period down by one or two and still win that period.
20752	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	(They) haven't been winning that period."
20753	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have been outscored 61-47 in the final 20 minutes.
20756	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score," Vanbiesbrouck said.
20758	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	It's not for lack of chances.
20759	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I just have to bear down in the crease area, make sure pucks are going in the net."
20760	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"You've got to have two lines scoring," Potvin said.
20761	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One could make the argument that when the Jokinen line was going the Weiss line was not, or the Weiss line was going and the Jokinen line wasn't.
20762	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	One line just isn't enough."
20763	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost, Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
20765	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Only last week, a hooking call against defenseman Jassen Cullimore with 2:21 left opened the door for Edmonton's rally in what proved to be a crushing 4-3 shootout loss.
20770	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I can't give an answer why."
20772	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One night it's there, the next it isn't," he said.
20773	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's 31 games now.
20774	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	We have to make up our mind
20775	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	we really have to buy into this or we're just going to waste another year."
20776	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	If that happens and Columbus makes the playoffs - the Blue Jackets returned from the break tied for eighth in the West - the Panthers would become the only team in the league to fail to reach the post-season since 2000.

20794	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Attacks in other parts of Iraq pushed the overall death toll to near 30.

20828	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, borders with Iran and Syria -- shut for three days as the plan got under way -- reopened Sunday.
20829	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	But new and strict rules will apply.
20830	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Moussawi was quoted in the Azzaman newspaper as saying the crossing points to the two nations would be open for only several hours a day and under "intense observation."
20831	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The United States and allies claim Iraqi militants receive aid and supplies from Iran, including parts for lethal roadside bombs targeting U.S. forces.
20832	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Iran denies any role in trafficking weapons.
20833	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	In Buhriz, a Sunni-dominated town about 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi soldiers kicked in doors and scoured homes, but most dwellings were eerily empty.

20838	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
20839	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37, a legal secretary.
20840	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
20841	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
20842	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The economic stimulus package that President Bush signed last week includes provisions aimed at pulling those rates down and reinvigorating a part of the mortgage market still stunned by problems with subprime borrowers that surfaced last year.
20843	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
20844	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rattled investors stopped buying them.
20845	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
20846	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
20847	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 for single-family homes.
20848	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
20849	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The amount would vary so that the most expensive areas would qualify for bigger loans.
20850	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
20851	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
20852	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
20854	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
20855	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
20856	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The most we can say right now is that there will be some opportunity for some borrowers to achieve perhaps some interest- rate relief on their jumbo mortgages," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey-based mortgage research firm.
20858	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
20859	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
20860	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of calculating the limits
20861	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	it's expected to tell lenders next month what the limits are in various areas.
20862	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
20863	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
20864	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts.
20865	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of the region they will use.
20867	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"While not every American is going to get to enjoy a higher loan limit, what makes this program exciting is that those who need the assistance the most are going to get it," said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Stanford Group.
20868	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
20870	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
20871	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She has an adjustable-rate mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly to a higher level.
20872	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
20873	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
20874	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
20875	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
20876	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
20877	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
20879	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	If investors feel that the larger loans inject too much risk into the pool of mortgages offered to them, they will demand a higher yield, which translates to higher rates for borrowers, said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital.
20882	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
20883	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
20884	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75.
20885	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."
20886	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
20887	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But even if rates drop, not everyone will be able to take advantage of them, Retsinas said.
20888	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

20969	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	SYDNEY, Australia 2007-09-07 07:56:51 UTC
20971	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Russian President Vladimir Putin and Australian Prime Minister John Howard signed the deal during bilateral talks on the sidelines of a summit of Pacific Rim leaders in Sydney.
20972	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	While the agreement forbids Russia from selling Australian uranium to any other nation or using it for military purposes, critics of the deal worry that it could make it easier for rogue states to obtain the raw material.
20973	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Asked whether Russia could be trusted not to sell Australian uranium to Tehran, Putin said his mineral-rich country already had an "excessive" supply of military-grade uranium that it was reprocessing and selling to U.S. power plants.
20974	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	"If we have a need to sell uranium to other countries, our resources, our own resources, are sufficient," Putin told reporters through a translator.
20975	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	He said Russia planned to build an extra 30 nuclear power plants over the next two decades and needed Australian uranium to complete the expansion.
20976	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Australia has the world's largest reserves of the atomic resource, but has no nuclear power program of its own.
20977	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Exporting uranium for nuclear power remains a touchy issue among many Australians, who are uneasy about its environmental impact and potential for weapons use.
20978	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Critics say the inflow of Australian uranium would allow Russia to divert its own supply of the atomic resource to military or export purposes.
20979	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	"It may very well be the case that what Russia will do will be to use Australian uranium for domestic purposes," Graeme Gill, a Russia expert at the Sydney University told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
20980	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	But "what that does is free up Russian sources of uranium, which they can then ship abroad."
20982	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	The prime minister also dismissed concerns about Australian atomic fuel falling into Iran's hands, saying that any uranium sold under the deal would be "subject to very strict safeguards."
20983	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Russia has built Iran's first nuclear power plant and has a significant financial stake in Iran's nuclear power program.
20984	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	In recent months, however, Moscow has played a complicated role in attempts to pressure Tehran to comply with global demands that it suspend its budding nuclear weapons program.
20985	APW_ENG_20070907.0462.LDC2009T13	Russia and China have blocked attempts by the U.S., Britain and France -- the three other permanent Security Council members -- to impose harsh U.N. sanctions and have hobbled efforts to move forward on new penalties this summer in the face of continued Iranian refusal to freeze its enrichment activities.
20986	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Football: Unstoppable Ronaldo keeps United on a roll
20987	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Cristiano Ronaldo continued his outstanding campaign with a goal and three assists as Manchester United cruised to victory over Aston Villa to open up a six-point gap at the head of the Premier League.
20988	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Wayne Rooney, twice, and Carlos Tevez were the players to benefit from the winger's service in a game that confirmed the scale of the task facing Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to overhaul the reigning champions.
20989	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	This was the perfect response to Arsenal's impressively resilient victory at Bolton earlier in the day that appeared to revive the London club title claims.
20990	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That win meant United kicked off just three points ahead of Arsene Wenger's side and, with Chelsea set to face Middlesbrough the following day, anything less than three points would have given the three-way battle at the head of the table a new twist.
20991	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	As it was Ferguson's side didn't just get the job done, they triumphed in a style that will undoubtedly suggested there is little chance of them throwing away such a commanding lead at this stage of the season.
20992	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	So comfortable was this win that Ferguson could afford to make three substitutions early in the second half when his side was already leading 3-0 to ensure fresh legs for the trip to face Roma in the Champions League quarter- final first leg in the Italian capital on Tuesday.
20993	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
20994	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But from the moment Ronaldo produced an impudent back-heel flick from ten yards out to divert the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and beyond Scott Carson for the 17th minute opener, United were almost completely in control.
20995	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed home.
20997	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
20998	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60 seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.
20999	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	And the England striker claimed his second, again courtesy of his in-form team- mate, when he collected Ronaldo's neat reverse pass and finished from close range.

21028	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	According to reports, the veins which drain from the two girls' brains are joined, causing blood to flow from one child to the other.
21029	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	As a result, the smaller of the two is suffering heart failure already.
21030	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Wirginia Maixner, director of neurosurgery at the hospital, has told Melbourne's The Age newspaper the task ahead was "momentous" but separation was the only option.
21032	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	But if one child dies they both die," Maixner told the newspaper.
21034	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	The charity has raised 250,000 Australian dollars (225,000 US) to cover the basic medical costs, but is still seeking 150,000 dollars to cover ongoing care costs, of which Smith said 10,000 dollars has so far been raised.
21035	AFP_ENG_20080115.0657.LDC2009T13	Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the government would see if there was any way it could help, but warned it was unlikely as large numbers of Australians with surgical needs were unable to pay for them.

21067	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The price of crude, which typically accounts for about 48 percent of the price of gasoline, accounts for 70 percent of the pump price today, he said.
21068	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	Weak returns refiners have posted recently attest to the industry's struggle to absorb higher crude costs, Felmy said.
21070	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	But it is still up more than 50 percent from a year ago.
21071	NYT_ENG_20080401.0002.LDC2009T13	The difference between what refiners pay for a barrel of oil and the price they get for products made from it is known as the gross refining margin.

21143	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Four Hamas militants were killed in the car, said medical officials at Shifa Hospital.
21144	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But on Sunday, at least 12 rockets landed in Israel, the army spokesman said.
21145	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Several hit the Karni crossing between Gaza and Israel, three fell in the Israeli border town of Sderot, causing damage but no casualties, and one set fire to a restaurant in a nearby kibbutz.
21146	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	More than 150 rockets have been launched at Israel since Tuesday, according to the army.
21147	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The Israeli government also said it would expedite the building of protected spaces in private homes for residents of Sderot, which has been hardest hit by the rocket fire.
21148	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The government's announcement on Sunday angered many Sderot residents, who said the action did not go far enough, Many were hoping that Olmert would order a re-invasion of the Gaza Strip, from which Israel withdrew in 2005, and some took to the streets in protest.
21149	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Mayor Eli Moyal has complained that in the six years since the rockets started falling on the town, the government has only managed to fortify schools and kindergartens, which have been closed for the past few days.
21150	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	"The municipal sports center is not protected, nor is this," Moyal said on Thursday, referring to his own top-floor office in the modest City Hall.
21151	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Though the number of Israeli deaths from the crude and inaccurate rockets from Gaza has been relatively low -- eight civilians since 2001, according to the police -- Sderot's residents have been affected physically and psychologically by the continued threat, say social service professionals in the town.

21160	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But the atmosphere remained tense between Fatah and Hamas, which share power in a unity government that has come under strain.
21161	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Some of the heaviest fighting in the past week took place around the Al Nour building, a residential block of 52 apartments next to the headquarters of the Hamas police militia known as the Executive Force.

21174	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	After feuding all year over who could best handle a "3 am" call in the White House, the candidates faced a real judgment call when iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, sparking global stocks contagion.
21177	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Both McCain and Obama went in search of that message Monday, courting voters who fear seeing their pension funds evaporate in the stocks freefall amid warnings other revered US financial instutitions were on the rocks.
21178	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Their focus on issues issue contrasted with last week's gutter politics which included the McCain camp accusing Obama of insulting Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin, in a distortion of his use of the phrase "lipstick on a pig."
21179	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama Monday immediately blamed eight years of Republican rule for the crisis, and predicted McCain would bring four more years of the same.

21184	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the campaign Obama tried to capitalize on a comment by McCain that he did not know as much about the economy as he should.
21187	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"It is amazing that they have not been able to do that to this point," said Dowdle.
21189	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	The Democrat had enjoyed a much wider lead on the issue for much of this year.
21190	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain has struggled to navigate away from Bush economic legacy, and Democrats argue that his economic policies barely differ from those of the current president.
21191	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	But Carly Fiorina, a top economic advisor to McCain, blamed Wall Street, lax regulation by the Bush administration and two years of Democrats in control of Congress for the economic blight.
21192	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	On MSNBC, Fiorina accused the Bush administration of presiding over a "Wild, Wild, West," with little regulation -- positioning McCain as a agent of reform and change -- not a prisoner of the president's legacy.
21193	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain's spokesman Tucker Bounds issued an acidic response to Obama's complaints about the Arizona senator's "fundamentals" comment.
21194	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama's short career as a public servant has been defined by pessimism, defeatism and weakness in the face of the great challenges of our time," he said.
21195	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"His lack of faith in American workers may explain his willingness to raise taxes during a struggling economy, but it is not way to lead our country."
21196	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	That comment appeared to be a direct attempt to draw attention to Obama's short time as a national figure, and to raise doubts that he was fit to take on the daunting challenge of pulling the US economy out of its hole.

21274	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	The rabbi of the movement that forms the backbone of Israel's settlement enterprise was most known in Israel for his call on observant soldiers in 2005 to disobey orders to dismantle 21 Jewish settlements during Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip that year.
21275	APW_ENG_20070928.0457.LDC2009T13	Many Orthodox Jews oppose any withdrawal from the West Bank or Gaza, considering them part of their God-given Promised Land.

21291	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not beholden to what former congresses did.''
21292	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Anne Kornblut of the New York Times asked McHenry if his complaint might come across as whining.
21294	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the Democrats' heavy-handed leadership.
21295	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But Republicans expecting Democrats to rule the House with an iron fist are likely to be pleasantly surprised: The incoming majority was having enough trouble keeping its own supporters in line.
21296	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	House Democratic leaders were giving their first news conference of the year when the session in the Cannon building was hijacked by Cindy Sheehan and other antiwar demonstrators, some wearing tie-dyed apparel and pins linking President Bush to Adolf Hitler.
21297	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Just after Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., vowed, ``We're gonna cut the interest rate in half for student loans,'' hecklers began to chant ``De-escalate!
21298	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Investigate!
21299	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Troops home now!''
21302	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The Democratic leaders in retreat, Sheehan seized the microphone.
21303	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We put them back in power,'' she said of the Democrats.
21305	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	And they're not requests -- they're demands.''
21307	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	So far, it's hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
21308	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The day began when House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam of Florida led fellow House GOP leaders to a news conference in a Capitol basement hall.
21309	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	At 32, he is a year older than McHenry, and several inches taller, but no less outraged by Democrats' refusal to bestow on Republicans the rights that Republicans refused to bestow on Democrats.
21310	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was covered with a layer of makeup.
21311	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're clearly disappointed,'' seconded Roy Blunt of Missouri.
21312	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm disappointed, as are some others,'' added Kay Granger of Texas.
21313	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
21314	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It fell to CNN's Dana Bash to point out the awkward truth.
21315	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``You can play back, almost verbatim, Democrats ... saying almost exactly what you all just said,'' she said.
21316	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``So is there a little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority rights?''
21317	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
21318	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were still in the majority?''
21319	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	inquired Rick Klein of the Boston Globe.
21320	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Well, I'll let Chairman Dreier speak to that,'' Putnam ventured.
21321	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Republicans must have known they'd have some explaining to do, because they scheduled back-to-back news conferences on their minority rights.
21323	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Granger had not updated her talking points.
21324	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``It's very disappointing,'' she said.
21325	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights.
21326	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	McHenry unfurled excuses: ``We were not in Congress.
21327	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... I didn't have the opportunity.
21328	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... She did not put it in legislative form.''
21329	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It had all the makings of a PR debacle.
21330	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Fortunately for McHenry, the Democrats were otherwise engaged.
21331	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	An hour after fleeing the microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about ethics and the minimum wage.
21332	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Rahm, would you answer Cindy Sheehan, though?''
21333	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``An hour or so ago you had to stop your remarks because (of) Cindy Sheehan.''
21334	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What are Democrats going to do about the war in Iraq?''
21335	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.

21355	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	At least 23 people drowned and 33 others were missing after an overloaded passenger ferry capsized off a northern Philippine province, the coast guard said Monday.
21356	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	The authorities said they recovered the bodies of 23 victims, who drowned after huge waves overturned the Maejan, a ferry carrying 102 passengers, just 200 feet off the shoreline of Cagayan province, north of Manila, on Sunday morning.
21357	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	Most of the survivors managed to swim to shore.

21359	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press quoted Joseph Llopis, the mayor of Calayan Island, as saying that hours before the ferry capsized, "three children fell into the sea as the vessel was lashed by huge waves."
21360	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	One of the dead was a 1-year-old.
21362	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	"There'll be no festive mood," the mayor said, according to an AP report.
21363	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	"Many of the dead were breadwinners."
21364	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	The coast guard said in a statement that the Maejan was buffeted by "big waves and strong current until it was dragged and capsized."
21366	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	Rescue boats and small planes were dispatched to look for survivors.
21367	NYT_ENG_20081215.0241.LDC2009T13	Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo, chief of the Philippine Coast Guard, said the Maejan was authorized to carry only 50 passengers and that criminal charges would be filed against its owners for overloading the ferry.

21429	APW_ENG_20080112.0203.LDC2009T13	Suharto's blood pressure was also stable, Subiandono said, though there was some bleeding in the stomach.

21451	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"Headwinds are materialising for growth," Luxembourg Finance Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said after chairing a meeting with his eurozone counterparts, also describing the bloc's economic performance as "satisfying."
21453	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The US and the eurozone are certainly different in that respect."
21454	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also acknowledged that "downside risks have increased" since he forecast in February that the eurozone economy would grow 1.8 percent this year.
21455	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Almunia said eurozone finance ministers expected a "better scenario" than the International Monetary Fund's recently reduced forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year in the bloc.
21456	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	He blamed the bleaker outlook on the current financial crisis, which he said was lasting longer than previously expected.
21458	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"We are receiving some negative impacts in our economies."
21459	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck saw no quick fix for the turmoil in the financial sector, he also warned against overreacting as he arrived for the meeting.

21464	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	While the outlook for economic growth was falling, Almunia said inflation was rising and would probably top the 2.6 percent he forecast for 2008 in February.
21467	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Slovenian Finance Minister Andrej Bajuk warned that the currently high inflation looked increasingly like it was not a temporary uptick but was here to stay for some time.
21469	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Although the euro's record strength helps limit the cost of dollar-denominated commodity imports like oil, it is also weighing on exports from the eurozone.

21474	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Hull City striker Craig Fagan could be out for three months after a dreadful challenge by Newcastle's Danny Guthrie left the forward with a broken leg.
21475	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Fagan was shielding the ball in the corner, looking to play out time in Premier League new boys Hull's 2-1 win away to Newcastle on Saturday when Guthrie ploughed straight into the back of Fagan and then received a straight red card.
21476	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	His sending off compounded a miserable match for Newcastle, which came just a day before owner Mike Ashley put the club up for sale in response to protests by fans who blamed him for the exit of popular manager Kevin Keegan.
21477	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Fagan left the ground on crutches and Hull confirmed Monday that an X-ray had revealed the 25-year-old former Derby forward had suffered a fractured right tibia, which could keep him out of action for between six weeks and three months.
21478	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Angry Tigers manager Phil Brown said there was no excuse for Guthrie's tackle, telling the Hull Daily Mail: "It cannot be tolerated, it needs to be kicked out of the game.
21480	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"That's the horrible side of the game.
21481	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	I don't care what is going on at Newcastle, you cannot tolerate this.
21482	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"If I go back to the incident, my players were killing time in the corner, something that every Premier League club does, no matter who you are.
21483	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"In the process of doing that, someone has decided to take the matter into his own hands and lashed out at Craig Fagan."
21484	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	A contrite Guthrie insisted later Monday his challenge had been "totally out of character", telling Newcastle's official website: "I was very upset to hear the news concerning Craig.
21485	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"The club have been in touch with Hull City on my behalf because I want to speak to Craig in person to apologise and wish him a speedy recovery.
21486	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	I hope to be able to do that as soon as possible.
21487	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"It was a challenge that came purely out of frustration towards the end of Saturday's game, but anybody who knows me will accept it was totally out of character on my part."

21489	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	More than a decade ago, Andrew S. Grove, then the chief executive of Intel, aptly described the hypercompetitive mentality of Silicon Valley in his book title, "Only the Paranoid Survive."
21491	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	After all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
21492	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
21493	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
21495	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	At Sun, he stood at an amused distance from the entertaining antics of the chairman, Scott G. McNealy, who railed against Microsoft and its leaders, Steven A. Ballmer and Bill Gates, as "Ballmer and Butthead."
21496	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
21497	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Yet he is openly taking on Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash. "This could be a signal that he's going to go straight at Microsoft, including disrupting their deals," said George F. Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research.
21498	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"This looks like the beginning of the formal war."
21499	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
21500	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
21501	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its chief legal officer, David Drummond, said in a statement Sunday afternoon that the proposed deal posed a threat to "the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation."
21502	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt called Yahoo's chief, Jerry Yang, to offer help, perhaps a partnership.
21503	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
21504	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.
21505	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Google's response looks like an overreaction, even a little panicky, to me," said Michael Sheridan, a venture capital adviser who worked with Schmidt at both Sun and Novell.
21506	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"But for Eric, it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door."
21507	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is a computer scientist who worked as a researcher at Bell Laboratories and at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center before moving into management.
21513	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
21514	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.
21515	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
21516	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
21517	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.
21518	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It is an assault that is just getting under way.
21520	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
21523	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
21524	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whether Google's concerns about Microsoft are justified is unclear.
21525	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
21526	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The longer Microsoft's purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online business remains unsettled.
21527	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft's use of the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN search service.
21528	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for searching.
21529	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
21530	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service.
21531	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was not anti-competitive.
21532	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
21533	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
21534	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
21535	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the two powerful companies have different business models that seek proprietary advantage in different places.
21536	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
21537	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court," he said.
21538	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The big software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows monopoly by stifling rivals.
21539	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem."
21540	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"At Google," Schmidt added, "we had a long conversation about, if we became a big company, how could we avoid that.
21541	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of technical things we can do and have done.
21542	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data.
21543	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is important because if" you can move your data from Google, you always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google.
21544	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is absolutely not true in Microsoft's history."
21545	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google is hoping that Microsoft's past will hamper its effort to become more formidable in the online business.
21546	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.

21551	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	There was confusion in the crowded courthouse as authorities barred British diplomats and Gibbons' employer from entering the chamber.
21552	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Sudan's prosecutor-general Salah Eddin Abu Zaid said Gibbons, who could face also face six months in jail and a fine if convicted, will receive a "swift and fair trial."
21553	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The case has sparked tensions between Sudan and Britain, the country's former colonial ruler.
21555	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"There is an innocent misunderstanding at the heart of this, not a criminal offense," Miliband told reporters.
21556	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	British diplomats "will do everything to avoid" any of the possible sentences that could be imposed on Gibbons, he said.

21561	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	But Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after complaints that she had insulted Prophet Muhammad, the most revered figure in Islam, by applying his name to a toy animal.

21572	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Djizouri, the lawyer, told The AP he would argue her case on the basis of Islamic Sharia law to show there was "absolutely no intention to insult religion, and for blasphemy to take place there must be an insult."

21612	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	A high-ranking US Treasury official is due to arrive in Beijing Sunday for talks with North Korean envoys on US financial sanctions which Pyongyang says stand in the way of an agreement on halting its nuclear arms program, an embassy spokesperson said.
21613	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Daniel Glaser, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, will hold talks with North Korean officials in the Chinese capital Tuesday, the spokesperson told AFP.
21614	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Talks last occurred between the two parties in December in Beijing, but ended in diplomatic deadlock.
21615	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Analysts say a resolution of the financial sanctions is critical to ending the broader problem of Pyongyang's nuclear drive, under discussion in parallel talks involving the United States, Russia, China, Japan and the two Koreas.
21616	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	After long negotiations, North Korea agreed in a September 2005 pact to dismantle its nuclear program in return for diplomatic recognition and food and energy aid.
21617	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	But the pact was never implemented because of Pyongyang's protests over financial sanctions Washington imposed on Macau- based Banco Delta Asia the same month.
21618	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	The United States claimed the bank served as key conduit for North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering.
21619	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Pyongyang has denied Washington's allegations.
21620	AFP_ENG_20070128.0071.LDC2009T13	Talks on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program attained new urgency in October when it tested an atomic bomb for the first time.

21629	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	BOSTON 2008-08-06 01:22:35 UTC
21630	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Eleven people, including a U.S. Secret Service informant, have been charged in connection with the hacking of nine major retailers and the theft and sale of more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
21631	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The data breach is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which said the suspects were charged with conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft.
21632	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Three of those charged are U.S. citizens while the others are from places such as Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus and China.
21633	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The indictment returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston alleges that the suspects hacked into the wireless computer networks of retailers including TJX Cos., BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp
21634	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW and set up programs that captured card numbers, passwords and account information.
21635	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"They used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data, which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves," Attorney General Michael Mukasey said at a news conference.
21636	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"And in total, they caused widespread losses by banks, retailers, and consumers."
21638	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said that while most of the victims were in the United States, officials still haven't identified all the people who had a card number stolen.
21640	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Sullivan said the alleged thieves weren't computer geniuses, just opportunists who used a technique called "wardriving," which involved cruising through different areas with a laptop and looking for accessible wireless Internet signals.
21642	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The information was stored on two servers in Ukraine and Latvia -- one with more than 25 million credit and debit card numbers and another with more than 16 million numbers, Sullivan said.
21645	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Court filings by some banks that sued TJX put the number of cards affected at more than 100 million, based on estimates by officials with Visa and MasterCard, who were deposed in the suit.
21646	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, TJX said it won support from MasterCard-issuing banks for a settlement that will pay them as much as $24 million to cover costs from the breach.
21647	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A similar agreement reached last November with Visa-card issuing banks set aside as much as $40.9 million to help banks cover costs including replacing customers' payment cards and covering fraudulent charges.
21648	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	According to the indictments unsealed Tuesday, three of the defendants are U.S. citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from China and one is from Belarus.
21649	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	One individual is known only by an alias online, and his place of origin is unknown.
21650	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	At a press briefing in San Jose, California, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the non-U.S. citizens under indictment were part of an international stolen credit and debit card ring.
21651	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The ring operated in mainly in Eastern Europe, the Phillipines, China and Thailand, and the alleged foreign conspirators remained outside the U.S., Chertoff said.
21652	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The thefts were criminal actions committed for the personal gain of the defendants, who investigators did not consider a national security threat, Chertoff said.
21653	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, their alleged crimes demonstrated the weaknesses of cybersecurity in the U.S.
21654	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Today's indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every American faces in the 21st century -- the fact that each individual's greatest asset is their names, their identity," Chertoff said.
21655	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In the Boston indictment, the alleged ringleader Albert "Segvec" Gonzalez of Miami was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy.
21657	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez was a U.S. Secret Service informant who helped the agency take over a Web site being used to transmit stolen identifiers and stolen credit card numbers, U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said at the news conference.
21659	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	But he said the Secret Service later found out that Gonzalez had also been feeding criminals information about ongoing investigations -- even warning off at least one person.
21660	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, we weren't happy that a person working for us as an informant was double-dealing," Mark Sullivan said.
21661	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments were also unsealed Tuesday in San Diego against Maksym "Maksik" Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr "Jonny Hell" Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia.
21662	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	They are charged with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data.
21663	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Yastremskiy was arrested when he traveled to Turkey on vacation in July 2007.
21664	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is facing related Turkish charges, and U.S. officials said they have requested his extradition.
21665	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Justice Department officials said Suvorov was arrested on the San Diego charges by German officials in March when he traveled there on vacation.
21667	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments against Hung-Ming Chiu and Zhi Zhi Wang, both of China, and a person known only by the online nickname "Delpiero" were also unsealed in San Diego.
21668	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A Justice Department spokeswoman said those three suspects, together with five others, are still at large.
21669	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Officials did not give an arraignment date for Gonzalez.
21670	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Yastremskiy, Suvorov and Gonzalez on 27 counts of fraud and identity theft.
21671	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The charges stemmed from allegations that they hacked into a national restaurant chain's computerized cash registers and stole credit card information from customers.

21679	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Sri Lankan authorities on Thursday ordered tens of thousands of ethnic Tamils living in Colombo to register with police a day after fierce fighting in the country's civil war killed 71 fighters, the military said.
21682	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities established a maze of roadblocks and checkpoints and continuously changed traffic patterns in Colombo in an effort to prevent new attacks.
21683	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	They have also required all residents of the north to register with the police upon their arrival in the city.
21684	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera announced Thursday that every Sri Lankan who came to Colombo from the north in the past five years would have to reregister with police en masse Sunday at police stations and other designated centers across the city.
21686	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The overwhelming majority of those people are ethnic Tamils.
21687	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"We will not harass people, but we will request, 'Please come,'" Gunasekera said, adding that the exercise was simply an effort by authorities to update their records.
21688	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	He did not say what would happen to those who fail to register.
21689	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Ethnic Tamils living in the capital have complained of frequent police raids, harassment and arbitrary detentions as the fighting between government forces, dominated by the Sinhalese majority, and the Tamil Tigers escalated in recent years.
21690	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities, who hold wide-ranging security powers under emergency regulations renewed by Parliament each month, have long accused rebel sleeper agents of hiding amid Colombo's Tamil community.
21691	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Mano Ganesan, a Tamil lawmaker from Colombo, said there would not be enough time to register everyone in one day and few will be able to produce the required documents from government agents in their faraway home districts.
21694	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	We will fight against it, but that is their plan," he said.
21696	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Other battles along the front lines killed five rebels and seven soldiers, the military said.
21697	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The government previously reported 40 rebels and four soldiers killed in other fighting Wednesday.
21698	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Much of the communication to northern Sri Lanka has been cut, and it was not possible to contact rebel officials for comment.

21703	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	However, a Special Forces soldier in the northern war zone told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a group of soldiers was killed by what appeared to be a burn agent loaded into a shoulder-fired rocket during a battle in the Kilinochchi district Monday.
21704	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The soldier, who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he had seen the bodies, and many were so badly disfigured they had to be buried in closed-caskets funerals.
21705	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Nanayakkara denied the account, saying that rebels had experimented with using chemical weapons, but had never employed them in battle.

21707	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The rebels have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese majority.

21710	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The rubbish crisis in the Naples area deepened Thursday as two treatment centres complained of paralysis and local authorities announced the upcoming closure of a major dump, an official said.
21711	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Outside the Caivano treatment centre some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the southern city, about 100 trucks were seen waiting to unload their rubbish.
21712	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Another centre that converts rubbish into fuel, located at nearby Giugliano, "is also functioning at a snail's pace", Ilaria Proietti told AFP.
21714	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The two-week-old crisis has seen some 15,000 tonnes of waste accumulate along roads in the southern province, including nearly 3,000 tonnes in Naples itself, because of a logjam at overstretched treatment and recycling centres, Proietti said Wednesday.
21718	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The chronic problem is the result of a lack of space in existing dumps, some of which have been closed by court injunctions after their operations were taken over by organised crime, dubbed the "ecomafia".
21719	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	A May 10 decree by the centre-left government creating four new dumps -- fiercely opposed by people living nearby -- will not come into effect for several weeks.

21722	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Major global news media have continued to give prominence to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which closed here on Sunday.
21727	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The "scientific outlook on development" values rational thinking.
21728	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	At it's core is putting people first and a basic requirement is balanced and sustainable development, the Yonhap report said.
21730	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The outlook would be combined with the theory of building a harmonious society, which strives to solve problems such as the urban-rural gap, the rich-poor gap and unbalanced development and gives priority to environmental protection, Yonhap said.
21731	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP) ran updated stories on the election of the new Central Committee and the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, as well as the conclusion of the congress.
21732	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP said the result will determine how strong the leadership is "as it tries to ease tensions over a wide rich-poor gap at home and manage China's rising clout abroad."
21733	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP also reported that a revision to the party's constitution endorses "the scientific outlook on development," calling for increased social spending to help farmers and urban workers whose living standards have not risen as fast as many other Chinese.
21736	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The report cited General Secretary Hu Jintao as saying: "The scientific outlook on development takes development as its essence, putting people first as its core, and comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement."
21737	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The scientific outlook on development requires China to move towards more sustainable growth and create a "harmonious society" by reducing the economic inequalities that have resulted from the economic developments, the DPA report said.
21738	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The China Press newspaper, published in the United States, covered at length the closing of the 17th CPC National Congress.
21739	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	An editorial of the paper said people's livelihood has become "the core of China's future development."
21742	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	"This is a strategic shift in China's outlook on development," the paper said.
21743	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Other international media such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Australian Associated Press and electronic and web news media of Singapore also issued reports on the closing of the CPC National Congress.

21755	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	As long as we carefully plan and organize the work, new houses will rise soon," said Wen, who expressed appreciation for their self-reliant attitude.

21773	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen went into the field, asking farmers about their crop yield.
21775	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At quake-devastated Dongfang Steam Turbine Co., Ltd. of Deyang, which Wen had visited twice previously, he was visibly happy to see production back at the pre-quake level.
21776	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He urged employees to continue working to build the company into a more advanced, secure and sustainable organization.
21778	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The worst-hit Beichuan County must be relocated as it was severely damaged in the quake and the original site might be vulnerable.
21779	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen again visited the debris where the county seat was once located.
21780	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He trudged on foot for an hour through the debris with a heavy heart.
21782	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told survivor Wang Dan, a 26-year-old woman of Qiang ethnic group, that the pain was overwhelming but the Beichuan people were strong.
21783	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"Although half of the population perished, the other half -- the survivors -- will build a new Beichuan with hope," he said.
21784	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	When invited by Wang to come again when the new Beichuan is built, Wen promised he would come to the place, which he would remember for life.
21785	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told local officials that the county should be rebuilt not only materially but also spiritually, as its unique Qiang culture should be preserved and promoted.

21789	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	We was robbed?
21790	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The blogospheric fan reaction to this year's Oscar nominations included -- as always -- a flurry of what-ifs: concern for ``Dreamgirls''' lack of a Best Picture nod, for the overlooking of Sacha Baron Cohen's acting, for the absence of ``Volver'' in the Best Foreign Language Film category.
21791	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Oh, the agony, the nitpicking, the sighs.
21792	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But for the winners, the winners!
21795	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There were the usual suspects -- Meryl Streep, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood -- and the surprises, like Rinko Kikuchi and Adriana Barraza (both nominated in the supporting actress category for ``Babel'').
21796	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There were the documentary makers who heard via pilot announcement on a commercial flight.
21797	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding hands when their film's nominations were announced.
21799	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, crazy day,'' said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as Ronnie the pedophile in ``Little Children.''
21800	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It started off with me pretending to sleep last night,'' he continued.
21801	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
21804	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
21805	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Overall, the academy dug international themes and locales, and diversity -- something it has taken a hit for in the past.
21807	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	(And let's be candid: The eight nominations include three in the same category, Original Song).
21810	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Commenting on the overall diversity in nominations, Deepa Mehta, director of Best Foreign Language Film nominee ``Water,'' said, ``It just shows that it's an international year, isn't it?''
21816	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Extra-thick double-fudge icing'' is how producer Peter Saraf referred to the film's Oscar success, which included nods for original screenplay and supporting actors Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
21817	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris watched the announcements on TV, hands clasped together.
21818	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``This is a new one,'' Faris said.
21819	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``We've never been through something like this together, but it's better than going through it alone.''
21820	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' ``Babel'' and ``The Queen'' in the Best Picture category are ``Letters From Iwo Jima,'' Clint Eastwood's World War II film told from the Japanese perspective, and ``The Departed,'' Martin Scorsese's thriller -- the most mainstream of the big picks and the one with the biggest domestic box office, at $121 million.
21821	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The directors?
21823	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Fun bits from Tuesday's announcements in Beverly Hills: Meryl Streep got her 14th Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress as the witchy boss in ``The Devil Wears Prada.''
21825	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And ``Little Miss Sunshine's'' 10-year-old Breslin could tie Tatum O'Neal in ``Paper Moon'' for the youngest Oscar winner ever.
21826	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.
21827	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Then there was the choice by the academy's screenwriters to nominate ``Borat,'' a film that was all allegedly unscripted and improvised, for Best Adapted Screenplay (the film scribes are apparently very, very confident of their future job security).
21828	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Speaking of job security, studio heads should perhaps consider backing anything -- anything, even a finger-painting tutorial -- that involves a combination of Clint Eastwood and Kate Winslet.
21830	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress for ``Little Children.'')
21831	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining Winslet in that category are Penelope Cruz for Pedro Almodovar's ``Volver,'' Judi Dench for ``Notes on a Scandal,'' Streep and Mirren.
21832	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In the Best Actor category, Whitaker is up against Leonardo DiCaprio -- who was nominated for ``Blood Diamond'' but was just as often mentioned for his role in ``The Departed'' -- Peter O'Toole (``Venus''), Ryan Gosling (``Half Nelson'') and Smith.
21834	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Arkin got the news that he was up for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the heroin-sniffing porn aficionado in ``Little Miss Sunshine'' while watching the sun rise over his home in New Mexico.
21836	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It was a brilliant script and a brilliant character, and the minute I read the script I knew I wanted to do it.''
21838	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I kept thinking yes, yes, yes, and then no, no, no, like a crazy person,'' she said.
21839	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Former Vice President Al Gore's pic on global warming, ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' was nominated for Best Documentary, which means there could be -- should be -- an intersection of politics and Hollywood on the red carpet come Oscar night, Feb. 25.
21840	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I talked with Al this morning,'' said Davis Guggenheim, the film's director.
21841	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``He was really happy.
21842	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I asked him, 'So you're ready to go to the show?'
21843	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And he said, 'I'll think about it.' ''
21846	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	... And a billion people will see him, and that means that more people will see the movie and wake up to this very inconvenient truth.''
21847	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Also nominated in the documentary category were filmmakers Rachel Grady (daughter of Washingtonian James Grady, author of the novel that inspired ``Three Days of the Condor'') and Heidi Ewing for ``Jesus Camp,'' a close-up look at summer camp for evangelical Christian kids.
21848	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The twosome were flying to Santa Barbara for a screening when they heard the news.
21849	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	A flight attendant had earlier given the pilot a heads-up, and the pilot contacted a United Airlines representative on the ground, who monitored the Internet for the news.
21851	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I'm only going to fly United from now on,'' Ewing said.

21854	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	Heavily armed rebels crossed into eastern Chad from Sudan on Wednesday, the government said Thursday, a month after a failed rebel attempt to overthrow President Idriss Deby Itno's regime.
21855	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	"Sudan on Wednesday launched several heavily armed (rebel) columns against Chad.
21856	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	These mercenaries crossed the border in the area of Moudeina," north of the border town of Ade, it said on national radio.
21858	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The two leaders are in Dakar this week for a summit of Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
21859	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The infiltration would be repeat of an incursion that saw rebel columns in pick- up trucks ride into N'Djamena on February 2 and 3 to overthrow Deby, who took shelter in his palace as street fighting raged.
21860	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	DISAPPOINTED ON TWO FRONTS
21861	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	With strong safety Jermaine Phillips out with a broken arm, Sabby Piscitelli has been under increased scrutiny lately.
21862	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And the second-year player from Oregon State responded Sunday with a memorable interception.
21864	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Moments earlier, a face mask against Gaines Adams wiped out Phillip Buchanon's interception.
21865	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right toward tight end Zach Miller.
21866	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The ball was off the mark and Piscitelli was off to the races.
21867	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field, shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11 for an 84-yard return.
21868	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.
21869	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Piscitelli, 25, talked about the return and the disappointment of the season-ending 31-24 defeat.
21870	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Describe the play.
21871	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	JaMarcus tried to look me off, and I just got a good break on it.
21873	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I tried to play the ball and do what I could with it.
21874	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm kind of disappointed I didn't score, but that's a long run.
21876	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I was trying to score.
21877	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I cut back and broke a tackle or two, but your body almost shuts off at that point.
21878	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I even tried to stop and let JaMarcus run by me.
21879	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But my legs were just (shot).
21880	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I just wanted to get all the yards I could at that second.
21881	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Did you see the block that Jackson threw for you?
21882	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Actually, when I cut off that (block), that's when my body starting shutting down.
21883	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm just glad the offense scored, and it kind of bailed us out of that situation.
21885	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	No excuses.
21887	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think we did play well on defense.
21888	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But we have to go to the film and see what our mistakes were.
21890	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How disappointing is it to have the season end this way?
21892	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I know it's something that I take personally.
21894	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How important was it to you to make a statement personally?
21895	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's what safeties and corners are there for to make those big plays and try to turn games around.
21896	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think the Bucs had that in mind when they drafted me.
21897	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's something I have to work on.
21898	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was good to help make a big play and to help us try to win this game.
21899	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The defensive line did a great job on that, so they get most of the credit.

21909	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Baseball players looking to harass Cuban umpire Yanet Moreno don't scream insults or burst from the dugout to kick dirt.
21910	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Those who really want to get under her skin propose.
21911	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"Beautiful," they call playfully.
21912	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"I'll marry you," they say.
21913	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno is the only Cuban female umpire to crack the National Series, the island's major professional league.
21914	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She worked her first game in December at the start of the most recent season.
21915	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"The crowd applauded, the players congratulated me," the 32-year- old umpire said recently.
21916	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't nervous, just excited because getting to that level was like a dream."
21917	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Ariel Pestano, a catcher for Villa Clara and for Cuba's national team, said Moreno wields even greater authority on the baseball diamond than her male counterparts.
21918	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"We have to respect her as an umpire and as a woman," he said.
21919	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	No woman has umpired an American major league regular-season game.
21920	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Ria Cortesio works in Double-A ball and became the first woman in nearly 20 years to work an exhibition in March, when she called a game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs.
21921	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno umpired 90 games last season in Cuba's top league, including the playoffs, during which she worked quarterfinal and semifinal series.
21922	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	The baseball season in Cuba runs from December through April.
21923	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"The key is to assert authority without abusing it," she said.
21924	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno sometimes works behind the plate, sometimes on the bases.
21927	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno became an umpire in part because of her frustration at not being able to play in organized leagues.
21928	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"Since I was little, I played with the boys in Alamar," she said, referring to the crowded Havana neighborhood where she grew up.
21929	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"My father would punish me, but I kept it up, anyway."
21930	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Cuba has a women's baseball team, but Moreno was too old to join when it was created.
21931	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Only players 24 and under can participate.
21932	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She began her career umpiring softball, then moved on to youth baseball games.
21935	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno's story has inspired other women to try their hands at umpiring: Thirty plan to attend the national school when a new round of classes begins in September.
21936	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Not all of them are likely to be accepted to the very selective National Series, however.
21938	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno, who hopes to become certified for international competition in Cuba after graduating from umpire school, said she still considers every game she works a learning experience.
21939	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"The important thing is doing something you love and doing it with all your heart," she said.
21941	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno conceded that she made two errors in judgment out of all the National Series games she worked last season.
21942	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Even when she makes a mistake, Moreno said with a smile, players' reactions are more mischievous than angry.
21943	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Yes, Moreno is single.
21944	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	But, no, she has yet to accept an on-field marriage proposal.
21945	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"There are a lot," she said.

21958	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	NICOSIA, Cyprus 2008-09-23 11:34:11 UTC
21959	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Protesters who defied Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip to bring aid to Palestinians last month are making a return voyage, a trip organizer said Tuesday.
21960	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Free Gaza organizer Greta Berlin said about 20 protesters will sail Wednesday from Cyprus aboard a boat named Hope for the 20-hour trip to the Palestinian territory.
21961	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Berlin said Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead McGuire, Palestinian Legislative Council member Mustafa Barghouti and an Italian opera tenor would be among the passengers.
21962	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	She said protesters would deliver a consignment of medicine and ferry Palestinians back to the east Mediterranean island on the return trip.
21964	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Palmor said he didn't know when a decision would be made, but that it was unlikely any decision would be announced in advance.
21965	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Protesters sailed to Gaza last month to protest Israel's yearlong blockade of Gaza imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas overran the territory.
21966	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	They hailed the trip as effectively ending the blockade.
21967	APW_ENG_20080923.0468.LDC2009T13	Israeli officials had said the decision to allow the boats to reach Gaza and then to sail back to Cyprus was an attempt to deny the protesters a propaganda victory.

21969	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	NANNING, Oct. 14 (Xinhua)
21970	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Five government officials from Hechi City in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been fired after 450 villagers were poisoned by drinking contaminated water.
21971	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Dismissed were: Wei Changze, director of Hechi Environmental Protection Bureau, Gan Hongyuan, deputy head of Jinjiang District, Zhao Shizhao, an inspector with the Environmental Protection Bureau, Yu Xian'an, director of the bureau's Jinjiang District branch and Wei Zhi, head of Dongjiang Town, reported China News Service.
21972	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	They were all accused of poor management and surveillance after 450 people were poisoned by drinking water containing arsenic.
21973	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Residents from two villages began showing symptoms like swelling in the face and eyes, vomiting and blurred vision Oct. 3.
21974	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Doctors said all patients are in stable condition and are recovering.
21975	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	Environmental testing showed the villages' water source was polluted by industrial waste discharged from Jinhai Metallurgy Chemical, a branch of the state-owned Liuzhou China Tin Co. Ltd. based in Guangxi's Liuzhou City.
21976	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	The Hechi government said the plant illegally discharged waste and got away with it because of the Environmental Protection Bureau's poor surveillance.
21977	XIN_ENG_20081014.0316.LDC2009T13	The city government suspended operation at the plant and ordered the company to pay for all the victims hospital bills.
21978	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	INSURERS CITED AS CAUSE OF CLOGGED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY SYSTEM
21981	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers are forcing many people who file disability claims with them to also apply to Social Security -- even people who clearly do not qualify for the government program.
21982	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially.
21983	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.
21985	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice.
21987	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The flood of referrals, however, is making it hard for Social Security to respond to people who are truly disabled, said Kenneth D. Nibali, the former top administrator of the Social Security disability program.
21990	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security.
21991	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old- age trust fund.
21992	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work force ages, since recovery time increases with age.

21998	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	Kenya's electoral commission had named President Mwai Kibaki winner of the Dec. 27 vote, but rival Raila Odinga alleges fraud and says the vote was rigged.
21999	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	Foreign observers have questioned the vote count, as has the chief of the nation's electoral commission.
22000	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	"Because of the perception that the presidential results were rigged, it is necessary ... that a proper tally of the valid certificates returned and confirmed should be undertaken immediately" by an independent body, Wako said in a statement.
22001	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	The dispute has led to political violence, as well as ethnic clashes between Kibaki's Kikuyu group and Odinga's Luo.
22002	APW_ENG_20080103.0491.LDC2009T13	The independent Kenya Human Rights Commission and the International Federation for Human Rights said in a joint statement that more than 300 people had been killed nationwide since Dec. 27, and the Norwegian Refugee Council estimated more than 100,000 people have had to flee their homes
22003	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	China to let migrant workers have say in legislature
22004	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	China's more than 100 million migrant workers do not have a single representative in the nation's parliament, but that may soon change, state media said Thursday.
22005	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers attending the annual session of parliament will vote on a bill stipulating provinces and municipalities with large numbers of migrant workers set aside a delegate quota for the group, Xinhua news agency reported.
22006	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	The National People's Congress brings together nearly 3,000 delegates from across the country, but not one is a migrant worker, according to the agency.
22007	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	"China's migrant labourer population has become larger...They should have a number of lawmakers to represent their rights and interests," Sheng Huaren, vice chairman of parliament's Standing Committee, was quoted as saying.
22009	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Xinhua gave a number Thursday of about 200 million migrant workers, of which more than 120 million work in cities and the remainder work in towns.
22010	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Another 13 million farmers will become migrant workers annually in the coming years, it said.
22012	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Despite ongoing economic reforms, China's migrant workers are shut out of the health care and education system, live in appalling conditions and are exposed to exploitative work practices, the London-based group said.
22013	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso urges EU states to help Malta on immigration
22014	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Friday he recognised the "special difficulty" Malta faced from illegal immigration and said member states must help it tackle the problem.
22015	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"They must put the principle of solidarity into action by providing help to Malta and other member states in managing the influx of illegal immigrants," he told Malta's parliament.
22019	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Many people in the rest of Europe were "simply unaware that the search and rescue area and jurisdiction of Malta is larger than the land mass of the United Kingdom, clearly disproportionate to its resources," he said.
22020	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso said that the coordinated maritime patrols between member states launched last month would become a permanent fixture from next January to help patrol the 27-nation bloc's southern borders.
22021	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"I set out today my intention that the European patrols network which started operation last May should become from January 2008 a permanent tool available at the request of member states to curb illegal immigration across the Mediterranean and along the south-east Atlantic coasts," he said.
22023	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"The commission cannot solve all the problems, not least (because) we don't have boats or planes.
22024	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	But I recognise that more should be done, especially by member states," Barroso said.
22025	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"Member states have planes, member states have boats, have resources which they can put at the disposal of a member state that has special difficulty.
22026	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Some political resistance is yet to be overcome."
22027	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the European Union expressed determination to save the lives of African migrants trying to reach its shores but struggled to find concrete ways to help Malta tackle the problem.
22028	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	German defense ministry terms video incident ' absolutely unacceptable '
22029	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-04-16 14:42:06 UTC
22030	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The German Defense Ministry said Monday that an incident in which a soldier was told to imagine facing hostile blacks in the Bronx while firing a machine gun was "absolutely unacceptable."
22031	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"This behavior is absolutely unacceptable and contradicts the training standards of the German army," defense ministry spokesman Thomas Raabe said at a news conference.
22032	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	He said the army was investigating the incident, recorded in an Internet video, and would probably complete the inquiry in two to four weeks.
22033	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video -- in which an army instructor tells the soldier to shoot and yell obscenities -- aired on German national television Saturday and prompted calls for an apology by the New York City borough's president.
22034	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video shows an instructor and a soldier in camouflage uniforms in a forest.
22035	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor tells the soldier, "You are in the Bronx.
22036	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A black van is stopping in front of you.
22038	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	... Act."
22039	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The soldier fires his machine gun several times and yells an obscenity several times in English.
22040	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor then tells the soldier to curse even louder.
22041	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The German Defense Ministry said the video was shot in July 2006 at barracks in the northern town of Rendsburg, and that the army has been aware of it since January.
22042	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"We found out about it because a soldier gave his superior a CD on which one could see the images," Raabe said during a news conference Monday.
22043	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video was greeted with indignation in New York, but has drawn only muted reaction in Germany despite following two other incidents that raised concern about training in the German army.
22044	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A group of instructors is now on trial for allegedly abusing recruits, while newspaper photos of German soldiers posing with skulls in Afghanistan caused a stir.
22046	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A headline Monday in the taz newspaper focused on U.S. reaction to the video scandal: "Army Video Horrifies New Yorkers."
22047	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	In an interview with AP Television News, Raabe said the incident was exceptional.
22048	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"In every society, in Germany, in France, in Britain and in the United States something like that happens but I think it is really an isolated case," Raabe said.
22049	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"We have a success story for more than fifty years in our German army and it is really seldom that something like that happens.
22050	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	I think it is not a special German problem," he added.
22051	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	In New York, Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. has called for whoever was responsible to be disciplined.
22052	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"The German government obviously has work to do to correct something that is insidious.
22053	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	... Clearly these folks don't know anything about African-Americans or the Bronx," he said Saturday.
22054	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video vanished from the German myvideo.de Web site but reappeared on youtube.com.
22055	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Roundup: Nepali gov't urged to pay more attention to disabled people by Rajeeb Man Tamrakar
22056	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	KATHMANDU, Dec. 3 (Xinhua)
22057	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Physically disabled persons in Nepal have expressed dissatisfaction over current political deadlock in the country while marking the International Day of Disabled 2007 on Monday.
22058	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Various programs were organized throughout Nepal to celebrate the 16th International Disabled Day 2007 with the theme of Decent Work for People With Disabilities.
22059	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	However, the disabled persons in Nepal are yet to be convinced if they are going to get decent work opportunity at the time when the country is going through a total mess due to disagreement among political parties.
22060	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We expected representation from our community in the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) elections, but it seems like the political leaders have made up their mind to stick on with the interim parliament and keep on postponing the elections," said Chhaya Shrestha, one of the participants of the rally organized to mark the day told Xinhua.
22061	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Lamenting over current coalition government's apathy towards disabled persons, Chhaya criticized the government for failing to offer them any opportunity after democracy was restored in the country.
22062	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We hoped to see physically disabled persons representing us in CA elections but the current political deadlock has put us into doubt if the election is ever going to take place or not," Chhaya added.
22063	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"The politicians only limit proportional representation and inclusive democracy in their speech," she added.
22064	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Similarly, there are thousands of people, who became physically disabled after losing their limbs and body parts during a decade long insurgency, still languishing for government's attention.
22065	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to Association for Injured and Disabled Combatant of the People's War, a sister organization of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN-M) expressed disappointment over government's indifference towards the country's disabled people.
22066	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to the association's data, some 2,000 CPN-M combatants who were disabled during the decade long people's conflict are not getting enough attention from the government.
22067	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Central member of the association Chitra Bahadur Gharti, who lost his right hand during the conflict, told Xinhua that some of the party cadres who lost their limbs and body parts during the conflict are currently languishing in seven different United Nations cantonments while those who can still provide assistance are still deployed in the field to carry out various party works.
22068	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We feel that the welfare of disabled persons is possible only through the restructuring of the state," said Gharti, adding that the main objective of the party would be to provide health, education and employment to the disabled persons.
22069	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He added that the CPN-M is providing skill oriented training to the disabled cadres at the cantonments.
22070	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, speaking at a program organized to mark the day, Speaker Subash Nembang stressed the need for Nepal to be a party to the United Nations (UN) Convention on Disability by ratifying it.
22071	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal (OHCHR- Nepal) Chief Richard Bennet also called on Nepali government to promptly ratify the convention.
22072	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He said so far 118 nations have ratified the convention and requested 13 countries including Nepal to ratify it.
22073	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Bennett noted, the majority of people with disabilities live in conditions of poverty, adding that "Access to decent work is the key to breaking that poverty trap, while the self sufficiency that work with fair pay and conditions brings enhances the dignity of the worker and contributes to the entire society and economy."
22075	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"There is a strong link between disability and poverty," the ILO report says.

22077	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 2007-10-06 10:50:38 UTC
22078	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Unofficial results showed Pakistan's Gen. Pervez Musharraf sweeping Saturday's presidential election, but the Supreme Court could still disqualify the military leader.
22079	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Chief Election Commissioner Qazi Muhammad Farooq announced that Musharraf had won 252 of the 257 votes cast in Parliament, with three ballots judged invalid and two votes going to his main rival, retired judge Wajihuddin Ahmad.
22080	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Pakistan Television reported unofficial results that Musharraf had also swept the voting in three of Pakistan's four provinces.
22081	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	Vote counting had yet to start in the fourth province of Sindh.
22082	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the official results can only be declared after it rules on petitions lodged by Musharraf's opponents that his candidacy is unconstitutional.

22085	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The long drought in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is threatening the survival of the country's tiny beaver population, according to local forestry sources.
22086	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	In northern Xinjiang's Altay area, low water levels have driven the semi-aquatic rodents from the Ulungur River, their main habitat in China, to look for new homes.
22087	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	"We have received reports that beavers have died searching for new habitats.
22088	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some are killed by dogs and some simply die from thirst," said Han Baohong, director of the forestry bureau in Fuhai County, on the lower reaches of the Ulungur River.
22089	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	"After the snow has melted in May, the drought will make living conditions even worse," he said.
22090	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some beavers had started digging into the banks of irrigation channels, posing a threat to local agricultural production.
22091	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The population of beavers in China is about 500, even lower than that of the giant panda.
22094	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The water volume of the Ulungur River is just 60 percent of level at the same time last year.
22095	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The forestry administration has called on residents to help protect beavers.
22096	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	It has also assigned workers to track the animals so they can help them survive.

22100	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	Net profit reached euro159.3 million (US$235.2 million) during that period, compared to euro136.6 million (US$201.7 million) in the second quarter of 2007.
22101	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	Revenues were euro1.59 billion (US$2.35 billion) during that time, compared to euro1.55 billion (US$2.29 billion) in the same period last year.
22102	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	Total fixed-line revenues were euro646.8 million ($955.1 million) in the second quarter, down 2.7 percent from that period in 2007.
22103	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	Mobile revenues were euro794.2 million (US$1.17 billion), up 7.6 percent.
22104	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	"Our mobile operations achieved dynamic growth and market share gains in all countries," said OTE Chairman and CEO Panagis Vourloumis.
22105	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	In May, the Greek government and Deutsche Telekom AG struck a deal on sharing OTE ownership and management control.
22106	APW_ENG_20080828.0457.LDC2009T13	Under the agreement, which Greece's parliament ratified in June, the government and Deutsche Telekom will each control 25 percent plus one share of OTE.

22109	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In an unprecedented move, the Palestinian Authority on Thursday placed the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas under house arrest.
22110	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	The decision came several hours after Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed an Israeli soldier and threatened to undermine the new Mideast peace agreement.
22111	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In response to the attack, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would crack down on the militants.
22112	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Palestinian policemen set up roadblocks around Sheik Ahmed Yassin's home.
22113	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Motorists were stopped and questioned.
22114	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Policemen opened trunks and aimed flashlights at passengers.
22115	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Journalists were told they could stick around for a few minutes to take in the scene, but would then have to leave.
22116	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	``Sheik Ahmed Yassin is under house arrest for security reasons,'' the Palestinian security services announced.
22117	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	It marked Arafat's first open confrontation with the quadriplegic Hamas leader, his strongest political rival.
22118	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	In the past, the Palestinian leader has detained lower-level Hamas officials from time to time.
22119	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	However, he never touched Yassin, apparently because he wanted to avoid an open and possibly bloody showdown with the militants.
22120	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	A relative of Yassin told The Associated Press by telephone that the Hamas leader had not been notified that he was barred from leaving his home.
22121	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	The man said Yassin's first appointment outside his home was Friday morning and that he had not planned to go out before then.
22122	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Arafat also ordered the arrests of dozens of Hamas activists.
22123	APW_ENG_19981029.1082.LDC2007T07	Two senior members, Mahmoud Zahar, and Ismail Hanieh, were among those detained.
22124	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The Fading of the Mirage Economy
22126	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Energy and food prices are soaring.
22127	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to collapse.
22128	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Government revenue is falling, and taxes are rising.
22129	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airlines are jacking up fares and fees while reducing service.
22130	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Banks are pulling credit lines.
22131	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Auto companies are cutting production once again.
22132	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Even investment bankers are losing their jobs.
22133	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The tendency is to see these as separate developments, each with its own causes and dynamic.
22134	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
22135	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.
22136	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the bubble has burst, we are coming to accept the reality of lower prices, reduced production, declining homeownership rates and the wisdom that a house is not an ATM or a substitute for a retirement fund.
22137	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
22138	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real estate.
22139	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The same factors that were behind the housing bubble were also at work, to varying degrees, in the auto bubble, the commercial real estate bubble, the travel bubble, the college tuition bubble, the retail bubble, the Web 2.0 bubble and most recently the commodities bubble.
22141	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Take the case of the airline industry, which likes to blame its woes on skyrocketing fuel prices.
22145	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
22146	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
22148	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
22152	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
22153	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That includes such things as cleaning planes
22156	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	and treating passengers fairly when flights are canceled.
22157	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But they also include costs that may be less obvious, like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs, paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
22158	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
22159	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
22160	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
22161	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
22162	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	What I've described is a double whammy for American households: the slower growth that comes with downsizing a number of key industries that expanded as a result of the credit bubble, along with rising prices for a food, energy, health care and almost everything imported.
22165	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Here in Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as the eye can see.
22166	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble.
22167	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Despite the happy talk you might be hearing from the presidential candidates, it presents Americans with a stark and unpleasant choice.
22169	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
22170	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Either way, it amounts to a lower standard of living than we thought we had achieved.
22171	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Is all this the end of the world?
22172	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the richest country on the planet, certainly not.
22175	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the first time since the early 1980s, Americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the U.S. economy regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and sustainable growth.

22190	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Families of more than 180 miners trapped in flooded coal mines in eastern China and presumed dead lashed out at one of the companies Tuesday, complaining it had ignored safety warnings to close.
22191	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Rescue workers were pumping water in a bid to reach 172 miners missing for four days in the Huayuan mine and nine others in a smaller mine run by another company "despite dim hopes for anyone to survive," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
22194	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Every year there is flooding," said Ma Xiumei, who came with her sister to the mine headquarters in Xintai, Shandong province, for information about their missing brother.
22195	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"If these miners are safely brought home we won't say a thing, but if it is the worst then they (the company) need to think about my younger brother's laid-off wife, his children, his aging mother," said Ma Xiuhua.
22196	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	At least two other mines in the area have said that worries about unusually heavy rains had prompted them to shut down Friday morning, raising questions about why the Huayuan Mining Co. continued to operate.
22198	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It quoted one worker as saying the mine had flooded every year since 2002.
22199	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Huayuan also reportedly received six phone calls from the Xintai Administration for Work Safety on Friday, before the accident, but took no action," the newspaper reported.
22200	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It said the administration urged local mines to stop production and evacuate mines during torrential rainstorms.
22201	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It also quoted Huayuan's deputy general manager, Zhang Canjun, as rejecting the allegation, saying it was "absolutely impossible," without elaborating.
22202	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Calls to the company and to the safety administration were not answered Tuesday.
22203	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The company and local government appeared to be isolating families and pressuring them to keep their anger in check after one family attacked a Huayuan office with sticks on Monday.
22204	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some neighborhoods with a lot of mining families have been sealed off, with plain-clothed guards keeping outsiders away.
22205	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some families have also been taken away and put up in hotels in the main center of Xintai, a 15-minute drive from the mining company offices.
22207	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	While the Ma sisters were speaking to a reporter, a woman with short-cropped hair and wearing white pants and a white shirt with a black leopard-spot pattern pulled Ma Xiumei aside.
22208	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Don't make a big thing about this, you have to think about your brother's job," the woman said.
22209	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Ma Xiumei said the woman worked for the mining company.
22210	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Security officials have also been trailing reporters in Xintai, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of Beijing.

22239	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Dela Cruz, who received immunity in April after prosecutors dropped murder charges against him in exchange for his testimony, had testified that Wuterich fired his M-16 rifle at the five men as they stood near the car, some with their hands raised in surrender.
22240	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	The defense had been expected to challenge that view.
22241	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich has admitted to shooting the men but said they began running away, defying orders to halt.
22242	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	His lawyers argued that running away in the moments after the bomb detonated could be construed as a hostile act under the Marine Corps rules of engagement in Iraq, where such attacks have posed the most frequent and deadliest threat to U.S. troops.
22243	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	But Wuterich's lawyers have not been able to prove that the men were running away
22244	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	on the contrary, testimony from a government forensic expert said the men's wounds suggested that they were not moving away when they were shot.

22250	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Those two men -- Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum -- were charged with killing nine people.

22253	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	In the statement, Wuterich took responsibility for his decisions in the heat of battle to kill people in the two houses who he said were suspected of being armed insurgents, and for the order he gave to his men to "shoot first, ask questions later."
22254	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	"I wanted them to understand," he said, repeating a central argument of his defense, "that hesitation to shoot would only result in the four of us being killed."
