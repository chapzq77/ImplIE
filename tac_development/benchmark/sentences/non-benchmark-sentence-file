48	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The Arab League is in dire financial straits because most of its 22 member states haven't paid all their annual contributions, said an internal report obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.
51	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	Member states have paid only 86 percent of their contributions due for 2006 and 2007, said the report, stating that members owed US$88 million (euro55.75 million) in contribution arrears.
52	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	The League's annual budget runs at about US$36 million, with most of the contributions coming from oil-rich countries likes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
53	APW_ENG_20080327.1095.LDC2009T13	But the report showed that some wealthy Gulf countries such as Qatar and Kuwait have reservations on their share of the budget --despite a boom in oil prices that has generated billions of dollars of additional revenues-- while poor nations like Somalia and Djibouti can't afford to pay their due.
56	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Tenor Placido Domingo peppered his classical repertoire with a crowd-pleasing array of popular music and even donned a mariachi suit and sang along with the audience, smoothing over controversy surrounding his Saturday concert at the Mayan pyramids of Chichen Itza.
58	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Domingo and Martinez also joined forces on a thundering, majestic tribute to the Mayan ruins in "The Silver Moon of Chichen Itza," by Lorena Tassinari, which he called "a kind of Mayan hymn."
60	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins.
61	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The concert's name is a reference to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.
62	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is marvelous to be here," Domingo said during a break.
63	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	"It is an honor for us to have a concert like this," said Armando de Leon from the nearby city of Merida.
64	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Herman Segovia came all the way from San Antonio, Texas, to hear Domingo, whom he called "an artist of high quality."

66	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	This is a controlled event," Segovia said.
68	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and activists have complained that concerts like Saturday's expose ruin sites to additional damage and degrade their cultural significance by treating them as mere backdrops.
70	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	But it faces increasing pressure from state governors to promote ruins which, critics argue, are already swamped with tourists.
71	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Officials did impose limits on stage and seating structures and the number of spectators for Domingo's concert, ensuring that it would be smaller than tenor Luciano Pavarotti's 1997 appearance at Chichen Itza, which drew 17,000.
72	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Since then, more than a half dozen concerts have been held at or near the ruins.
73	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	Despite intermittent drops of rain, Domingo opened masterfully with the inspiring "O Souverain" from Massenet's Le Cid.

82	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The program also includes the melancholy, melodic "Lamento di Federico" from Francesco Cilea's "L'Arlesiana," and the soaring "Gia nella notte densa" from Verdi's Otello.

85	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Two more suspects in China's tainted milk scandal were set to go on trial Tuesday, bringing the number to 17 who are facing court over the nation's worst food safety case in years.
86	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Brothers Geng Jinping and Geng Jinzhu were scheduled to be tried for making and selling food additives laced with the chemical melamine, the China News Service said.
87	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	At least six babies in China died this year and 294,000 fell ill after drinking milk laced with melamine, which is normally used to make plastic.
88	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The chemical was mixed into watered-down milk to make it appear richer in protein, but it caused severe kidney and urinary tract problems in babies who drank contaminated milk powder.
90	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	Officials at the court in northern Shijiazhuang city refused to comment on the proceedings, but the China News Service said notices of Tuesday's trials were posted at the courthouse.
91	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	On Monday, nine people suspected of trading or producing the tainted additives went on trial in Shijiazhuang and surrounding districts, while five others were tried on Friday last week.
92	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	In China, trials often last just one day and verdicts are announced soon after.
93	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The verdicts in the milk trials will be "announced at an appropriate time," state press reports said, giving no other details.
97	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The group was once one of China's leading dairy producers but last week filed for bankruptcy due to the losses it incurred over the scandal.

101	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He washes down his Zoloft with Mountain Dew.
102	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the phone in the other room, Michelle is pleading with the utility company to keep their power on.
103	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?"
105	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Troy, they don't care," Michelle says, her patience stretched.
107	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
109	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The panel returned with bold recommendations, including the creation of a national cadre of caseworkers and a complete overhaul of the military's disability system that compensates wounded soldiers.
110	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But so far, little has been done to sort out the mess of bureaucracy or put more money in the hands of newly disabled soldiers who are fending off evictions and foreclosures.
111	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the Turner house, that leaves an exhausted wife with chipped nail polish to hold up the family's collapsing world.
112	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
113	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But since Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
114	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
116	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
118	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or randomly explosive.
119	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
120	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't deal with everyday stresses of living," Michelle says.
121	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't make decisions.
122	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is a worrywart.
123	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Fearful.
124	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's like they took Troy and put him in a different person."
125	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	As thousands of war-wounded lug their discharge papers and pill bottles home, more than a quarter are returning with PTSD and brain trauma.
126	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Compensation for these invisible injuries is more difficult and the social isolation more profound, especially in rural communities where pastures outnumber mental health providers.
128	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live in a small rental house in the northern tip of West Virginia, surrounded by enormous blue sky and the dark spine of South Branch Mountain.
129	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	There is a VFW tavern in town, but Troy doesn't bother.
130	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After one of his distraught soldier buddies from Iraq got so drunk he wrapped his motorcycle around a tree, Troy stays away from alcohol.
133	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His speech is sometimes soupy from mood stabilizers.
134	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The meds give him tremors.
135	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He used to cut the grass and bring home a paycheck, but now he stays inside like a perpetual patient.
136	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle for everything.
137	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"What is the name of the doctor who looks at knees?"
138	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	he asks one day.
139	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle takes a breath.
140	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Orthopedic," she says.

143	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At 31, her eyes are hollowed by worry and her brown hair is turning gray.
144	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
145	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The all-day journey requires a babysitter for the kids -- ages 10 and 11, both from previous marriages -- and burns $25 worth of precious gas.
146	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
147	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	One hot morning, they set out for Martinsburg yet again.
148	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury -- he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital wants him back for more comprehensive testing.
149	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy and Michelle are quiet on the ride into Martinsburg.
150	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Bible rests on the back seat.
151	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two- lane highway.
153	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Finally Troy says he thinks his new medication is making him less aggressive.
154	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
155	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You don't have an `off' button anymore," she says.
156	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy, in the passenger seat, keeps his eyes on the road.
157	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They broke it off when I was over there."
158	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He served with the 3rd Infantry Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
159	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before that, he spent a decade with the National Guard, pulling a tour in Bosnia.
161	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
163	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While he was on home leave from Fort Stewart one weekend, Michelle found him sitting on the bed with a bottle of pills.
164	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he couldn't go back.
165	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle drove him to the Martinsburg VA hospital, which shipped him to Walter Reed for three weeks of psychiatric care.
166	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He was sent back to Fort Stewart and returned to duty, a reality he could not cope with.
167	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
168	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
169	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
170	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.
171	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship, she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat her well.
172	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They were married on Valentine's Day in 2005.
173	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
174	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
175	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His family needed the $2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in the truck with him.
178	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Like many wounded soldiers, he was clobbered by a fine-print government regulation known as "concurrent receipt," which prevents double compensation.
179	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	That meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army.
180	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 13 months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was reimbursed.
182	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
183	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His illness has eroded their marriage, but on the morning they arrive at the Martinsburg VA hospital, she leads the charge on his behalf.
185	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
187	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cafeteria smells of bleach and canned peaches.
188	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the small lobby of the neuropsychological department, Troy leans over the sign-in clipboard, pen in hand, staring at the sheet.
189	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle tells him what day it is.

193	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't take no for an answer," he tells Michelle.
194	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Huntington (a VA regional office) says you are his fiduciary, right?"
195	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle says.
196	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
197	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't let these people get over on you!"
198	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She returns to the waiting room.
199	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
201	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse.
202	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
203	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
204	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in again.
206	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"You think he's violent at this point?"
207	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.
208	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle dodges the question.
209	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He's not getting any counseling," she says, leaning against the door.
210	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The counselor explains that all 50 beds in the program are full and the waiting list is 25 deep.
211	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
212	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle's voice breaks.
213	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I know you are doing the best you can," she says.
214	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anymore, he's just ashamed.
215	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	I wish I had a video camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an average day looks like."
216	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests.
217	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
218	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He tells Michelle how hard he tried, and she smiles and touches his arm.
220	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The clerk tells Michelle that unfortunately the doctor is on leave for the next month.
221	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The first available slot is five weeks out, at 8:30 a.m.
222	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
223	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
224	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have a three-hour drive."
225	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Nine o'clock is the they best they can do.
226	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
227	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office on the first floor.
228	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government has promised to care for its wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this, where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage reimbursed.
229	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The VA mileage rate has not changed since 1977.
230	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is still paid 11 cents a mile.
231	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
232	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
233	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On the way home, Michelle pulls into a Flying J truck stop, pumping gas in the hot breeze, watching the numbers spin higher.
234	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Money became so desperate this spring that Michelle contacted Operation Homefront, a national organization that gives emergency assistance to deployed service members and the returning wounded.
235	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In a sign of the deepening financial crisis faced by many back from war, Operation Homefront has provided $2 million in bailout funds to 4,300 families so far in 2007, double last year's caseload.
236	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.
237	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they had no other choice.
238	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The $860 VA disability check barely covers expenses.
239	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has been pushing to have VA re-evaluate Troy in hopes of getting his disability rating raised and his compensation increased.
240	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function without her.
241	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
242	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
243	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.
245	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
246	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is "chronic and severe."
247	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle gets copies of the medical records and sits down with them on her living room floor.
248	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Wearing an Army T-shirt that says "Got Freedom?"
249	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	she begins reading.
250	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The documents are a gold mine of information that validate what she has said all along.
251	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels sickened.

253	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has nightmares frequently, two to three times a week, in which he sees himself back in Iraq ... and Baghdad.
254	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He sees himself fighting, sees dead bodies, parts of bodies, blood rushing from bodies.
255	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he hears bullets passing over his head.
256	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is fearful and scared and wakes up in cold sweats.

259	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle goes page by page.
260	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is in his recliner holding the remote control.
261	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From time to time she looks up at him, then her eyes go back to the records.

263	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He has a lot of guilt feelings that he could not save his sergeant.

273	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle calls out to Troy.
274	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They are saying your memory is extremely low," she says.
275	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"And here's another thing.
276	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	`Hearing loss.
277	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
279	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	According to VA, he doesn't meet the criteria for 100 percent because his impairment is not "persistent," with "persistent delusions" or a "persistent danger of hurting himself or others."
280	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is still able to perform his own hygiene.
281	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	From Michelle's point of view, Troy can hold a toothbrush, but he can't hold a job.
282	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
283	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She has a year to appeal the rating.
284	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
285	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
286	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
287	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.
288	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
289	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	During the intake session in Martinsburg, he is withdrawn and sullen.
290	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
291	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The news punches Michelle in the gut.
292	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy is allowed to come home on weekends, so Michelle makes the four-hour round trip to pick him up on the first Friday night.
293	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
294	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
295	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle pleads with him to get in the truck but he won't, and he loses his spot in the program.
296	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy returns to his recliner.
297	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA tells Michelle that a contract counselor who visits rural counties will be in touch to schedule time with Troy.
298	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
299	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
301	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They are strained beyond belief.
302	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Still, there are moments of gallows humor.
303	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
305	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
306	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
307	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy declines.
308	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
309	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Other people got wounded, and all I got was a mental thing," he says.
310	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle raises an eyebrow.
311	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's still an injury."
312	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
313	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Plus, the fact that guys are missing arms and have bullet holes and everything else.
314	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Ain't a scratch on me."
315	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	To remember who Troy used to be, Michelle keeps a photo of him hidden in her camera case.
316	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the picture he is smiling and eager, ruggedly at home in his Army fatigues.
317	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now she looks at the man in the recliner.
318	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's people like you that made our country," Michelle says.
319	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back to filling out forms, and Troy goes back to Nickelodeon.
320	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	IN THE END, TENNESSEE LIVES UP TO SEEDING
323	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Scared?"
325	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't say scared.
326	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
329	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The dream was about to end.
330	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr did not make another 3-pointer, and the Volunteers (29-4) went on a 10-4 burst in a difficult 72-57 victory over the Eagles (21-11).
332	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	For most of the game, he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the Tennessee defense.
333	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American outrebounded a taller Tennessee team, 39-27, by spreading out the Volunteers on defense.
334	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Tennessee big men were stuck outside trying to help on screens being set for Carr.
335	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
336	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's a race to the boards."
337	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The difference in the game was a two-minute stretch that ended with about four minutes left in the second half and with Tennessee holding a comfortable lead.
339	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said.
340	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I turned it into a one-on-one game on the defensive end, me against him.
341	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	I wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
342	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for Tennessee.
343	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a 3 down," Carr said.
344	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
345	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The Volunteers took a 63-53 lead as American managed just one field goal over its next nine possessions.
346	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Smith finished with 19 points to lead Tennessee.
348	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
349	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31 free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.
350	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Chris Lofton, Tennessee's leading scorer (16.1 points), was only 1 of 7 from the field.
351	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament.
352	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Simon was averaging 7.2 points.
353	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl came to his postgame television interview on the floor still wiping the sweat from his brow.
354	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Most expected his team to have an easy time of it.
355	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference regular-season championship and was briefly ranked No. 1.
356	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Now, there is some question how fit the Volunteers will be Sunday against seventh-seeded Butler, which defeated South Alabama, 81-61.
357	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did not show any discouragement afterward.
358	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"This is the NCAA tournament," Pearl said, "and no matter how we try and prepare you guys to understand that this is what it is, this is what you get, you just think that we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way."

385	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	GOING WITH THE FLOW
386	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Back in the 1970s, when Lou Casagrande was starting out as a curator at the Science Museum of Minnesota, visiting a museum aimed at kids sometimes felt like being in a "pinball machine."
388	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We went probably too far.
389	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was too much energy.
390	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
391	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	That was then.
392	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Now, as Casagrande readies the Children's Museum for its April 14 reopening, he's talking up the new exhibitions, from the tennis ball launcher to a light-box dance floor.
393	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But he's just as excited about a catchphrase he has been using to describe the $47 million expansion project: Visitor flow.
394	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The idea is not as glitzy as a cantilever or a glass elevator - two of the snazzy features in the new Institute of Contemporary Art - but it's good news to anyone familiar with the way the museum used to feel.
395	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"For us," Casagrande says, "this is the biggest revolution."
396	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
397	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some spots - the fourth floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible to find.
398	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
399	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
400	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
401	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new building won't alleviate all these problems.
402	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But several key design features should help.
403	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
404	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors, some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
405	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	While many a city has gotten into the children's museum business lately, Boston's edition has a long history.
407	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
408	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	After two decades in its spot, the museum undertook a renovation plan, closing on Dec. 31 to complete its current expansion.
409	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled, rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front of the taller, existing brick warehouse building.
410	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The defining feature of the newer space is its open feel.
411	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
412	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A series of 10- to 12-foot-wide hallways, reached by a stairway or elevator and stretching the entire length of the expansion, connect the new section with the old.
413	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	This is how visitors get around.
414	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the end of each of these hallways, there's a spot for visitors to pause and relax.
415	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
416	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Visitor flow has driven the new project to the point that the expanded Children's Museum isn't actually all that much bigger than the old space.
417	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
418	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	How can an expanded museum be barely expanded?
419	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the institution's needs.
421	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing is the museum becomes much more functional."
422	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Consider how the space is used.
423	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The fourth floor is now off limits to visitors, used mainly for offices.
424	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A bigger and technologically updated KidStage has moved from the tucked away corner to the ground floor.
425	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	With three floors, not four, open to the public, activity is pushed down, and spread throughout.
426	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
427	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Wide doorways have been cut into the brick that used to be the outside of the museum.
428	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Each gallery is accessible through the bridges.
429	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the ease with which its visitors walk through the building.
430	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Smaller, newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
432	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
433	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There is a lot that's new about the expanded museum.
434	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The KidPower section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move an exhibit sign up and down.
435	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There's a dedicated space for traveling exhibitions.
436	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story climb.
437	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	And even the restaurant changes, from McDonald's to Au Bon Pain.
439	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs, and a giant chess game.
440	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But in less than an hour, the staff can break down, and move out, all the activities.
441	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	What's left is a large, central space for groups to gather.
443	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We hosted significant performances from area artists, dancers, and musicians in there, and it was a serious impediment to flow in the museum.
444	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The Common is going to be a very important space.
445	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It'll give families a space to sort of rest and recharge.
446	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then when we're having our large festival days, the exhibits can be swept out."
447	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Boston isn't the only children's museum concerned about the way people get around the building.
448	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In Philadelphia, the Touch Me Museum is constructing an $88 million building set to open next year.
450	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's very important for visitors, and particularly for families, that they not feel crowded," says Kolb.
451	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's scary enough to come into a city."
452	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new Touch Me Museum is three miles away from the old building.
453	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In an interview, Kolb doesn't even mention the building's architect.
454	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"It's the parking we're moving for," says Kolb.

458	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	When the expanded Children's Museum reopens on April 14, there will be a little of the old, and a little of the new.
459	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Here are a few familiar exhibitions, and a few potentially exciting new stops.
460	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The old
461	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant to send a signal to children that the building might look different, but it's still their children's museum.
462	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Boats Afloat, with its mini-system of canals and riverways, hasn't moved from the second floor, and hasn't been redone.
463	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	There used to be two mock supermarkets on the third floor.
464	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	One is gone, but the Colmado has been restocked, and is pretty much the way it was.
465	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new
466	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	KidPower, in the front atrium on the ground floor, gives children a chance to launch tennis balls by pulling a rope attached to a bowling ball.
467	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	They can also move a sign up and down by using hand-pedaled bicycles.
468	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The three-story New Balance Climb has levels that are meant to resemble flying carpets.
469	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The device also offers one of the museum's best views - if you're willing to climb for it.
470	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The famous outdoor Milk Bottle (left) has been rebuilt, and a series of mazes - made of rock and brick - have been installed on a new plaza.
471	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Later this year, kids will be able to climb through a series of boulders installed in the area.

473	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Amsterdam shutters famous Yab Yum sex club due to suspected criminal links
475	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	One of Amsterdam's best-known sex clubs has become the latest victim of the city's crackdown on organized crime infiltration of the city's world famous sex industry.
477	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Amsterdam has been conducting a crackdown on criminality in the city center for nearly five years, using a 2002 law that forces business operators to disclose detailed accounting in order to have their licenses renewed.
478	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal activities.
479	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The owners were allowed to respond to the conclusion, but could not convince the city not to withdraw its license, the municipality said in a statement.
480	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Wooldrik would not elaborate on what kind of criminal activities were suspected, but so-called private clubs and brothels have in the past been accused of laundering money for crime gangs involved in everything from drug dealing to extortion rackets.
481	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	The club's owners have been ordered to close it down within weeks, but can appeal the decision to pull its license, Wooldrik said.
482	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Nobody answered the phone at Yab Yum on Friday.
483	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Entry to the club costs euro70 (US$100), according to its Web site, which shows pictures of an ornate bar and private rooms featuring double beds and huge bath tubs.
485	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	In September, the city announced that a public housing corporation had bought 18 buildings in the Red Light District to redevelop them -- a deal that could lead up to the shuttering of one third of the windows where scantily clad prostitutes stand to attract customers.
487	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON 2007-07-17 13:40:23 UTC
488	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The terrorist network Al-Qaida will likely leverage its contacts and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S. soil, according to a new National Intelligence Estimate on threats to the United States.
489	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The declassified key findings, to be released publicly on Tuesday, were obtained in advance by The Associated Press.
491	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	As expected, however, the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
492	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The report makes clear that al-Qaida in Iraq, which has not yet posed a direct threat to U.S. soil, could become a problem here.
495	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments of the 16 spy agencies across the breadth of the U.S. government.
496	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	These agencies reflect the consensus long- term thinking of top intelligence analysts.
497	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Portions of the documents are occasionally declassified for public release.
499	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It also provided new details on their thinking and concerns.
500	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	For instance, the report says that worldwide counterterrorism efforts since 2001 have constrained al-Qaida's ability to attack the U.S. again and convinced terror groups that U.S. soil is a tougher target.
501	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But, the report quickly adds, analysts are concerned "that this level of international cooperation may wane as 9/11 becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge."
502	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Among the report's other findings:
503	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Al-Qaida is likely to continue to focus on high-profile political, economic and infrastructure targets to cause mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, economic aftershocks and fear.
504	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
507	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--The group will continue to seek weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological or nuclear material -- and "would not hesitate to use them."
509	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--Non-Muslim terrorist groups probably will attack here in the next several years, although on a smaller scale.
510	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The judgments do not name any specific groups, but the FBI often warns of violent environmental groups, such as Earth Liberation Front, and others.
511	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are part of a longer document, which remains classified.
512	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It was approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
513	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	In the last week, reports on this document and another threat assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
515	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	But critics say the evolving threat is evidence of a policy gone wrong.
516	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The debate -- and the underlying global problem -- will not go away soon.
517	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas, especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is expanding.
518	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ... points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate," the estimate said.
519	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"We assess that this internal Muslim terrorist threat is not likely to be as severe as it is in Europe, however."
520	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	U.N. OFFICIAL ADVANCES PLAN THAT COULD MAKE KOSOVO INDEPENDENT
521	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	PARIS
522	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
523	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
524	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
526	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
529	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	NATO troops, which have kept peace in Kosovo since fighting ended in 1999, would remain for the time being.

541	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The truck was ferrying merchandise and people back from a local market near the southeastern town of Gueckedou when the accident occurred Sunday, state-run RTG radio reported.
542	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	The 50-year-old rock and cement bridge collapsed as the truck was crossing, tipping the vehicle and sending people as well as bags of cement and sacks of rice crashing into the river.
543	APW_ENG_20070321.0537.LDC2009T13	Many of the dead drowned, trapped under the merchandise, RTG said.

551	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	CAUTION, NOT PANIC, SEEN AFTER DRUG WARNINGS
552	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	A new study may help quiet fears that the suicide warning labels on antidepressants are scaring countless patients away from medications that could help relieve their suffering.
553	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The warnings, which were mandated in 2004 by the Food and Drug Administration, say the drugs can increase the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior in some young patients.
554	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They stirred a fierce debate among psychiatrists, health officials and patient advocates, with critics saying the ruling (and the headlines that accompanied it) went too far.
555	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the study, which appears Tuesday in The Archives of General Psychiatry, finds that while the warnings appear to have alerted patients and doctors to a possible risk, they have not caused a sharp decline in treatment rates.
556	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The report is not likely to be the last word on the antidepressant debate, experts said.
557	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But they added that it provided one of the clearest pictures to date of how patients and doctors behaved in the wake of a controversial decision by drug regulators.
558	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The researchers analyzed prescription rates from three time periods: May 2002 to June 2003, just before the debate over antidepressant side effects flared
559	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	June 2003 to October 2004, the period after the first public alert, that the drug Paxil by GlaxoSmithKline was associated with an increase in suicidal thinking in minors
560	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	and October 2004 to December 2005, the year after the FDA called for prominent warnings on the labels of all antidepressants.
561	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	They found that the rate of Paxil prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased by 44 percent after the 2003 warning on that drug.
562	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	But the rate for similar drugs, including Prozac by Eli Lilly, continued to increase in that age group through 2003 and fell off only slightly after the labeling change, in 2005.
563	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	The rate of prescriptions to new patients -- a particular concern for psychiatrists critical of the warnings -- did not change significantly during the warnings or after.
564	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	Prescription rates to adults increased in the years studied.
565	NYT_ENG_20080107.0224.LDC2009T13	In sum, the drug agency's warnings seemed to prompt caution rather than panic.

574	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	And everyone was smiling.
575	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"You've either got to take it or I'm going to break it," Bean told the boy.
576	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"He was happy, and I was happy to get rid of it."
577	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean was happy with the results of the driver he used Saturday.
578	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He used a driver he'd tried earlier in the year on the Florida swing.
579	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	It was one of 40-some drivers he's tested this season.
581	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Hale Irwin, who had a two-shot lead after Friday's first round, struggled to a 1-under 71 but leads by one shot.
582	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, who has won 45 tournaments on the Champions Tour, has won 33 of 47 tournaments in which he was leading or sharing the lead heading into the final round.
583	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	When asked about his success while playing with the lead, Irwin stuck his fingers in his ears and said, "La, la, la, la, la, la!"
584	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin, Bean and Bobby Wadkins will play in today's final round pairings.
585	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean and Wadkins, who shot a 67, are tied for second.
586	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Five others -- including Loren Roberts, Jim Thorpe and Gil Morgan -- are tied for fourth two shots back and 14players are within three shots of the lead.
587	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But seeing Irwin's name at the top of the leaderboard can't be too comforting for the rest of the field.
588	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"Trying to make up shots on Hale isn't the easiest thing in the world," Bean said.
589	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"I know I have to shoot at least this well (66) to have a chance."
590	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Irwin had a three-shot lead after three holes when he made a 12-foot putt on the par-3 third hole.
591	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He was his typically consistent self -- hitting fairways and greens -- on the front nine.
592	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	But Irwin struggled on the back nine.
593	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	He started with an errant drive to the left on No. 17 and had to scramble, eventually sinking a 5-foot putt for bogey .
594	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Yet for all of Irwin's troubles -- he was going to go over them in his hotel, not at the range -- he still leads the tournament.
595	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that it's over, and I'm in the lead," Irwin said.
596	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"The positive is that I went from a two-shot lead to a one- shot lead."
597	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	Bean hopes they can both put their best golf on display.
598	NYT_ENG_20070318.0045.LDC2009T13	"When you beat him, you usually beat a guy that doesn't make mistakes," Bean said.

701	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said they were working to address the problems at Walter Reed and were examining the situation at other medical centers.
702	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We have let some soldiers down," said Pete Geren, the undersecretary of the Army, addressing the panel before the hearing began.
703	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The hearing was held by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose members convened in an auditorium at Walter Reed, in deference to the soldiers who were to testify.
704	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop for the hearing, the first of several that congressional committees intend to hold.
705	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The subcommittee members heard first on Monday from two soldiers badly hurt in the war in Iraq, and from the spouse of another soldier injured in Iraq, about their experiences at Walter Reed.

711	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
712	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He told of languishing in the hospital's bureaucratic system that evaluates soldiers for continuing in active duty or becoming medically retired, and what benefits they should receive.
713	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start over several times.
714	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Spc. Jeremy Duncan, one ear shredded by a makeshift bomb, told of the moldy living conditions in Building 18.

717	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"My life was ripped apart the day my husband was injured, and having to live through the mess we've had to live through at Walter Reed has been worse than anything I've had to sacrifice in my life," Annette McLeod said through tears.
718	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said he was "extraordinarily angry and embarrassed" by the living conditions at the hospital, reported prominently last month by The Washington Post.
720	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Army officials said extensive repairs were being made to deal with the deplorable conditions at one of the facilities on the hospital campus, Building 18, in which soldiers getting outpatient treatment at the hospital were found to be living in crumbling rooms soiled by mice, cockroaches and mold.
721	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Most of the soldiers living there, they said, have now been moved.
722	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Allegations about shoddy treatment received by wounded soldiers at the prominent hospital, which is the centerpiece of the military's medical system, have touched a public nerve and deeply embarrassed the military in the past few weeks.
723	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has been thrown on the defensive, and members of Congress have been quick to express outrage.
725	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq."

729	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we send more and more troops into Iraq and Afghanistan, these problems are only going to get worse, not better," he said.
730	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Last week, Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey was ousted over his handling of the revelations at Walter Reed, and officials changed the hospital's commanding officer twice in as many days.
732	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"There will be no excuses, only action," Cheney said.
733	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"As we work to improve conditions at Walter Reed, we want to find out whether similar problems have occurred at other military" and Veterans Administration hospitals, he said.
734	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"These brave men and women deserve the heartfelt thanks of our country, and they deserve the very best medical care that our government can possibly provide."
735	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news articles have hinted at similar problems for years.
736	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
737	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"You're not going to be able to Scotch tape over it," he said.
738	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
739	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We really need to reinvent this process," Kiley said.
740	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
741	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He was pressed on Monday to explain how he had not known about the conditions at Building 18, even though he lived across the street from it.
742	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He explained that inspections of barracks were not part of his normal job duties.
743	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But the subcommittee members continued to hammer him, asking why he had not taken action earlier to deal with the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and wondered whether recent efforts to contract out services to civilians had left the hospital depleted.
744	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.
745	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Beyond specific steps to streamline the bureaucratic process that is faced by wounded troops and to improve living conditions, military officials said it may be time to re-evaluate whether Walter Reed should be closed in several years, as had been previously planned as part of a national base reorganization process.
746	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Several patients at Walter Reed attended the hearing Monday and echoed some of the problems described.
747	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But Staff Sgt. Brian Beem, who lost his right leg to a makeshift bomb in Baghdad in October, said he had no idea conditions were so bad for some of his counterparts, even though he had heard grumbling.
748	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"At my level," Beem said, "I'm ignorant of it."

756	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	He recalled: "Twenty years ago at this very border -- which was then still the border of Yugoslavia -- people were shot at if they tried to cross illegally."
758	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	"That is why I can't be pessimistic about the future (of the EU), when I see where we are now and where we come from."
759	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	He noted that the lifting of the barriers was more than a symbolic or political gesture, and that it had "concrete meaning" for Europeans, allowing easier travel, improving relations between states and enhancing growth and employment.

770	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	The ceremony ended with the inauguration of a monument indicating the distances from Hegyeshalom to all European capitals.

824	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
825	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather, died of cancer in August 2006.
826	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was always going to be a difficult hurdle for me to get back into the winner's enclosure after Heather passed away... It's a big mental hurdle that I have crossed today," the 39-year-old said.
827	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as his thoughts drifted to his family.
829	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	.
831	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
832	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said it was the most important victory of his career as it cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.
833	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes there's a black hole.
834	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's not easy to see through," Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has endured since his wife died.
835	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	In that respect, Clarke dedicated his victory to his sons, aged nine and seven.
836	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"This win is for Tyrone and Conor," he said, while also thanking all his friends who had supported him over the past 20 months.
837	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke, who for many years had been a mainstay in Europe's Ryder Cup team, had watched his world ranking plummet out of the top 50 to 236 at the start of the BMW Asian Open.
838	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said his win on Sunday was the result of practising 10-12 hours a day.
839	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"I've been working harder than I've ever worked on all aspects of my game.
840	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's nice to see it pay off," he said.
842	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	However Clarke missed a par putt of less than two feet on the 16th, then bogeyed the 17th after driving into the trees to allow Derksen a share of the lead.
843	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"From the the 14th onwards.
844	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I lost my concentration.
845	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	I started thinking about Heather and the boys and bits and pieces," Clarke said.
846	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"In this game, unless you keep your concentration for the whole way around, you make mistakes and that's what I did."
847	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	On the 18th, Derksen chipped his third shot to within two feet to be almost assured of a par.
848	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	That left Clarke with his putt of nearly 30 feet to win the tournament or face going into a playoff with Derksen.
849	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"On the last green I gathered myself and said: 'Right, hit a good putt'.
850	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Luckily I did," a beaming Clarke said.
851	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Derksen paid tribute to Clarke afterwards.
852	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"Darren doled a good putt and that's his day," said Derksen, who was bidding for his third win on the European Tour.
853	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	"It was a great match... He's a great winner."
854	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke said he would now strive to return to the world's top 50 and get his place back in Europe's Ryder Cup team.

858	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it canceled round trips to New York, Dallas, Chicago, Calgary, Calcutta and Dubai.
859	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The rest of the 82 flights canceled Wednesday were for destinations in Germany and Europe.

863	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	It said a similar plan for intercontinental flights will follow soon.
865	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"There are not yet measurable effects of possible further strike actions and cost burdens from the ongoing negotiations," Mayrhuber said, speaking at the company's release of second- quarter earnings Wednesday.
867	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The ver.di union, which represents about 50,000 ground service personnel and a small number of cabin staff, started an open- ended strike for more pay Monday.
868	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The first day of strikes had little effect on the Cologne-based airline's flights, but approximately 70 flights were canceled Tuesday.
869	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The union is seeking a 9.8 percent pay rise for a year, while the airline has offered 7.7 percent for 21 months including a one- time bonus payment.
870	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Gemkow said the union and airline were not in discussions currently.
871	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The union isn't ready to talk to us at the moment," he said.
873	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	"The strike is damaging air transport, tourism, logistics and the whole economy -- and that in a phase in which economic signals are in any case pointing downward," Werner Schnappauf said in a statement.
875	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	He said that, for instance, both Lufthansa Technik, the company's aircraft maintenance and repair business, and catering unit LSG SkyChefs usually do a lot of work for airlines other than Lufthansa, but that extra revenue was not coming in from outside customers during the strike.
877	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	Haupt said the cargo division was doing its best to compensate for the strike by using different internal personnel, including some from outside Germany, as well as other service companies.

899	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Roger Federer is not lonely at No. 1.
900	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He has plenty of company off the court.
901	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	New York has been the site of Federer's three consecutive U.S. Open triumphs, and the two-week event has also given Federer a platform to meet and befriend luminaries.
902	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Anna Wintour and Tiger Woods are now only a phone call away.
904	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wintour threw Federer a dinner party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and invited 60 guests, including the designers Diane von Furstenberg, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta.
905	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"That was great fun," Federer said Friday in a public garden atop Niketown, before speaking to children from the City Parks tennis program.
906	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer first met Wintour at a charity event in New York.
908	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I know Anna very well," Federer said.
909	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"And then meeting the designers -- these people are a big inspiration.
910	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	I've gotten into fashion the last few years, done my own fashion statements on center court at Wimbledon."
911	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer wore a white blazer with the "RF" crest at Wimbledon, where he has won five straight titles.
912	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Anna said that was fantastic," Federer said, grinning.
913	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I think she's also excited about this outfit at the Open."
914	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Wearing different styles for day and night matches, Federer is seeking to become the first man in the open era to win four straight U.S. Open titles.
915	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Lendl and John McEnroe also won three in a row.
916	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	In July, Federer tied Bjorn Borg's record of five straight Wimbledon titles.
917	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It would be nice to win four in a row, but basically I'm here to defend my title for last year," Federer said.
918	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Wimbledon was great because it was five in a row.
919	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	That was for me a really big streak."
920	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	The victory at Wimbledon gave him his 11th major title.
921	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	A month later, Woods won his 13th major title, at the PGA Championship, stoking their friendly competition to catch their sports' career leaders (Pete Sampras's 14 major titles and Jack Nicklaus's 18).
922	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Last September, Woods was in Federer's box to watch him win the U.S. Open final against Andy Roddick.
923	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Only afterward did Woods and Federer meet for the first time.
924	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"I had met many sports greats, but Tiger was a logical thing because we were always talking about each other," Federer said.
925	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Now they frequently talk or text-message each other.
926	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	(Federer said he did not think that Woods, a new father, would be coming to the Open this year.)
927	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	They have seen each other play when their tournament schedules overlap, in Shanghai, Miami and Dubai, where their Gillette advertising campaign was announced in February.
928	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Watching Woods play made him feel even more of a kinship.
929	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"He does things a little bit similar to me," Federer said.
930	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"Like on the golf course, you think he's serious, so focused, concentrated guy.
931	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	But then you get little hints of actually what personality he has off the golf course.
932	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	When he gets a bit angry or laughs or does a joke with other golfers.
933	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Off the court, he's so laid back, it's unbelievable."
934	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer, 26, from Basel, Switzerland, is also laid-back.
935	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He travels with a small entourage led by his longtime girlfriend, Mirka Vavrinec, who arranges his schedule in minute detail leading up to the Open.
936	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Even though he has had daily practices since arriving Tuesday, Federer said he was grateful for some down time in New York after a grueling last few weeks in North America.
939	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Federer avenged that loss at Wimbledon in a five-set thriller.
940	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"It's good sometimes to lose," said Federer, who followed the loss in Montreal by defeating James Blake for the title in Cincinnati last week.
941	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	"You start new.
942	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	Like last week, people talk, people think.
943	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	One week later, you've won and everything is OK again.
944	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	There was nothing to be worried about."
945	NYT_ENG_20070824.0204.LDC2009T13	He has been No. 1 alone for 186 consecutive weeks.
946	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	BOSNIA BIGGER WORRY THAN KOSOVO
947	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
948	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	2008 will be a pivotal year for both Kosovo and Bosnia.
949	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Kosovo will likely declare independence from Serbia in the next few months.
950	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If it does, the United States and most members of the European Union will recognize Kosovo, but will insist upon the establishment of an international mission similar to the United Nations Office of the High Representative in Bosnia to ensure the new state's stability.
951	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Serbia and its patron Russia will strongly oppose any move towards independence by Kosovo, but what form that opposition will take is uncertain.
952	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Contrary to some news reports, Serbia will not demand control of the Serb entity in Bosnia - or Republika Srpksa (RS) - in exchange for the loss of Kosovo.
953	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Doing so would almost certainly lead to a direct confrontation with the United States and European Union.
954	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Neither Serbia nor Russia wants that.
956	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	And despite the sentiment in some quarters for Kosovo remaining an autonomous province of Serbia, the prospects of that occurring are close to zero.
957	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	An independent Kosovo will be a weak state for many years to come, but it will not be (or allowed to be) a threat to the region.
958	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the political future of Bosnia is murky.
962	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The Bosniaks, on the other hand, under the leadership of Haris Silajdzic, have pushed for a strong central government.
963	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The international community has tried without much success to navigate these opposing positions.
964	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	A set of amendments to the constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament.
965	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	EU-led efforts at police reform were likewise rejected in October.
966	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of national legislation easier.
967	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	These reforms essentially challenged the practice of elected representatives and government ministers of absenting themselves from key votes.
968	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	RS politicians, who frequently deployed this tactic to avoid being outvoted, interpreted these reforms as a threat to the entity and to their ethnic protections at the state level.
969	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	They provoked a crisis by demanding that the High Representative rescind his measures.
971	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
972	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains unresolved.
973	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The political situation is now fraught with uncertainty for a number of reasons.
974	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	First, the international community is anxious to end the U.N.'s Dayton mission and turn the reform effort over to the EU.
975	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	?
976	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	However, the events of the past six months have clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to go it alone.
977	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Second, during the past year the RS economy has grown rapidly while that of the other entity, the Bosniak-Croat Federation, has stagnated.
978	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The RS may not be hesitant about using its new economic power to push for more devolution of political power.
979	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	Bosnia is at a precipice.
980	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If the international community commits itself to finishing the job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a constitutional government capable of serving all the people of Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future of the country will brighten considerably.
981	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If, however, the international community turns its back on Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next year.
982	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In view of the enormous investment that the international community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.

985	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Video pulled off YouTube after U.S. Navy complaint
986	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18 (Xinhua)
987	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	A video clip shot by sailors aboard U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan has been pulled off the YouTube video sharing website after Navy officials complained it might compromise security, a report said Saturday.
988	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	The video, apparently shot by sailors based at a naval base in California, has caused one sailor to be "counseled" and the ship's captain to be called to the Pentagon to review security procedures, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper.
990	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Titled "Women of CVN 76: 'That Don't Impress Me Much'," the four- minute clip had been viewed 31,000 times before it was pulled off the popular website, apparently by the person who posted it.
991	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	CVN 76 is the Navy's call-sign for the aircraft carrier, which is longer than the height of the Empire State Building and home to 5,500 sailors.
992	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	A Navy spokesman in San Diego told the paper that the video " was a lighthearted and positive description of women officers and sailors aboard aircraft carriers and in Navy squadrons."
993	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Charlie Brown said the Navy was concerned that the video producers exercised a "lack of propriety" in a few scenes involving sailors dancing and lip- synching with safety equipment.
994	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	One of the scenes showed a sailor dancing to the ditty dressed in a full-body radiation suit, and also showed the doors to the Reagan's nuclear power plant.
996	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Navy regulations strictly forbid the dissemination of photos of anything related to the ship's nuclear propulsion gear.
997	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	Brown said the ship's captain was summoned to a Pentagon meeting about the video, and the sailor who produced the video was counseled.
998	XIN_ENG_20070818.0166.LDC2009T13	According to the report, the sailor who posted the video was not identified, but his YouTube page also features videos of Naval aviators based in California's Ventura County that frequently are stationed on board the Reagan.

1005	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"Both of us have good performance," said Wang, who won an Olympic final rematch against Ryu Seung Min of South Korea to make the quarters.
1006	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	"Samsonov and Ryu are among the top players in the world and it's a good opportunity for me to face them here and beat them."
1007	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	Samsonov, who has never claimed a world championship but won three European top honors and two World Cups, saw a possible turning point in the third set as he earned three set point on 10-7 and denied Wang's late comeback to win it 15-13.
1008	XIN_ENG_20071215.0151.LDC2009T13	The former leading one in Europe's "Good Time", however, has been ousted from the main group of world top class table tennis, succumbed to the world number one Chinese 11-9, 11-5, 13-15, 11-9, 11-7.

1042	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Forecasts of future continental motion developed slowly as offshoots of the theory of plate tectonics, which won acceptance in the 1960s and 1970s, shattering old dogmas of continental immobility.
1043	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory of plate tectonics holds that the surface of Earth is composed of a dozen or so huge crustal slabs that float on a sea of partially molten rock.
1044	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over ages, hot convection currents in this sea, as well as gravitational forces, move the plates and their superimposed continents and ocean basins, tearing them apart and rearranging them like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.
1046	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Colliding plates grind past one another about as fast as fingernails grow.
1047	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, geologists measure such changes with great precision thanks to the advent of global positioning satellites and small base stations that dot remote areas of the planet and operate unattended.
1048	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Arrays of such instruments track the overall movement of plates.
1049	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	From the start of the theory's acceptance, geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past and to render it in credible reconstructions.
1050	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A famous result was Pangea -- "all the land" in Greek -- a supercontinent that some 200 million years ago held the outlines of today's continents in embryonic form.
1052	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
1055	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
1056	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And in another 50 million years, he added, Los Angeles will have moved up the west coast into Alaskan waters.
1057	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Such visualizations caught the eye of Scotese in the late 1970s when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
1058	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He loved the challenge of the big picture, and of using his computer programs, new to such work, to speed the endless drawing and redrawing.
1059	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	With his graduate adviser, he made detailed maps showing the past evolution of the continents.
1060	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And he toyed with their future shapes.
1061	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
1062	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
1063	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"I said, 'Hold on, how could I possibly project that far?"'
1064	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	he recalled.
1065	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"But being a rash graduate student in need of extra change, I decided to give it a try."
1066	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
1067	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Scotese drew a series of futuristic maps and, in the 1990s, found an ideal way to communicate his increasingly detailed visions of the terrestrial past and future: over the Internet.
1068	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, Scotese's Web site, www.scotese.com, which he started in 1998, showcases his work, called the Paleomap Project.
1069	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Teachers use his animations, and his site has won scientific awards.
1070	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	(He aids the publishing world, too, providing Press and his co-authors with their map of the future world.)
1071	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, some of his most ambitious efforts center on envisioning how Earth might look 250 million years from now.
1072	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The easy part, Scotese said, is the continents.
1073	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their masses might change shape but seldom disappear altogether because their bedrock weighs little compared with dense ocean crust.
1074	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Continents literally float above the action.
1075	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	So do mountains.
1076	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Once formed, they tend to persist, disappearing only after ages of erosion wear them down.
1077	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The difficult part, he said, is predicting the development of new subduction zones in the seabed, and in comprehending how aggressively they rearrange the land.
1078	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to understand all the forces down there," he said.
1079	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"There's probably some input from the mantle," the deep, hot, churning zone below the crust.
1080	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It probably has some say on which way the plates go."
1081	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	His long-term forecast, despite the uncertainties, portrays a distant time when the world's continents come together again to form a new supercontinent, which he calls Pangea Ultima.
1082	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	An animated depiction of Pangea Ultima demonstrates a bold exercise in futuristic thinking.
1083	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	First, the Mediterranean closes.
1085	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Antarctica also moves north, shedding its icecap.
1088	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Scotese said, the biggest tectonic change of all -- driven by a giant subduction zone -- has torn through the dark Atlantic and begun to eat up seabed, slowly closing the ocean.
1089	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some 200 million years from now, the closure forces Newfoundland to smash into Africa and, a bit later, Brazil to ram into South Africa.
1090	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The collisions gain force
1092	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"It's more like a big donut or bagel than Pangea," Scotese noted.
1093	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In looking for a name, "I tried Bagelea or Donutea but figured that would trivialize the whole experience.
1094	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A friend suggested Pangea Ultima -- classy, like a fancy car.
1095	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It implies that it's the last Pangea, which certainly isn't true, but it's the last one I'm going to come up with."
1096	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over billions of years, the continents have split and joined repeatedly in a slow dance.
1097	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
1098	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	As Scotese envisioned, they can break apart and reverse course to merge again.
1099	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.

1102	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
1103	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Instead of the Atlantic disappearing, they say, the Pacific might slowly vanish, sending North and South America careering into Asia.
1105	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But he said his vision bore no special likelihood of coming true.
1106	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"My guess," he said, "is that the Pacific should disappear."
1108	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Geologists, he said, know too little about the causes of plate motion to predict the dance of continents into the far future.
1109	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But in the next few decades, he added, progress in geology is likely to lay bare Earth's inner workings and enhance the art of plate forecasting.
1110	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Even with today's efforts, Murphy said, "all the coughing stops in class when I show a projection.
1111	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It's a very interesting way to look at the world."
1112	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"The most important thing to realize," he said, "is that modern geology is just a snapshot of a continuous-action movie.
1113	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	When you zoom out and look over a long enough time, you realize everything is mobile."

1132	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	The party primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the year- end legislative elections is already over, but former members of the disbanded New Tide Faction who have fallen into disfavor are still incensed about the way they were treated by the party's central leadership.
1135	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Asked how they will respond if the party leadership decides to summon them to run in "tough electoral zones" where the odds are against DPP candidates, at least four of the "11 nemeses" within the DPP reacted with indifference or made sarcastic remarks.
1136	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Of the 11 nemeses -- reform-minded former members of the New Tide Faction who dare to criticise the party's policies -- all but one failed to be nominated to run for a legislative seat.
1138	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng had lambasted Lin a week earlier for calling former New Tide faction members defeated in the primary "opportunists."
1139	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	Cheng said those who were branded as opportunists are unfit to be nominees in tough districts.
1140	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	"If we lose, we will be blamed for not having enough voter support.
1141	CNA_ENG_20070527.0022.LDC2009T13	And if we win, the credit will go to the party central because of its successful strategy," he said.

1193	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Second-quarter earnings at International Business Machines Corp. rose 12 percent and beat Wall Street forecasts Wednesday, largely on the strength of IBM's software division and improvement in its services unit.
1194	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	From April through June, the Armonk, New York-based technology bellwether earned $2.26 billion (euro1.64 billion), $1.55 (euro1.12) per share, on revenue of $23.8 billion (euro17.27 billion).
1195	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the comparable period last year, IBM earned $2.02 billion (euro1.47 billion), $1.30 (euro.94) per share, on revenue of $21.9 billion (euro15.89 billion).
1196	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	This year's quarterly numbers were boosted $81 million (euro58.79 million), or 5 cents per share, from the sale of IBM's printing division to Ricoh Co.
1197	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Without that gain, IBM would have earned $1.50 (euro1.09) per share, beating the estimate of $1.47 (euro1.07) expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.

1204	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Before the earnings report came out Wednesday, IBM stock gained 31 cents to close at $111.08.
1205	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In after-hours trading, shares gained $1.17.
1206	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	One common gauge of IBM's health is services contract signings, because it foretells huge chunks of revenue that will be booked in future quarters.
1207	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's services division inked $11.7 billion (euro8.49 billion) in contracts in the second quarter, compared with an unusually soft $9.6 billion (euro6.97 billion) a year ago.
1208	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Revenue actually booked in the second quarter rose 10 percent to $13.1 billion (euro9.51 billion).
1209	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM's hardware division saw revenue rise 2 percent to $5.1 billion (euro3.7 billion), though it would have been flat if not for currency fluctuations.
1210	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Software is IBM's smallest unit but accounts for an outsized portion of IBM's profit.
1211	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	That has prompted the company to make dozens of acquisitions to bolster its security and business- management offerings, including this week's $161 million (euro116.84 million) deal for DataMirror Corp.
1212	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	IBM software revenue grew 13 percent to $4.8 billion (euro3.48 billion) in the second quarter, and pre-tax profit was $1.25 billion (euro0.91 billion), just slightly less than what the much bigger services arm generated.
1213	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	The sales growth would have been 9 percent at constant currency rates.
1214	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	In the first six months of the year, IBM earned $4.11 billion (euro2.98 billion), $2.75 (euro2) per share, with revenue of $45.8 billion (euro33.24 billion).
1215	APW_ENG_20070718.1602.LDC2009T13	Those numbers all rose from the first half of 2006, when IBM showed profit of $3.73 billion (euro2.71 billion), $2.37 (euro1.72) per share, and revenue of $42.5 billion (euro30.84 billion).

1257	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The International Monetary Fund announced plans Friday to cut up to 15 percent of its staff in a wide-ranging overhaul aimed at shoring up finances at the multilateral economic institution.
1258	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	In comments posted in an internal IMF magazine, the organization said the planned overhaul aimed at budget savings of around 100 million dollars annually and possible job losses of between 300 and 400 staff.
1259	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Such cuts could affect around 15 percent of the IMF's total headcount of 2,600.
1260	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	An IMF official, who requested anonymity, told AFP the job cuts would likely occur over three years starting on May 1, 2008.
1261	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	The jobs losses, if implemented, would rank among the largest in the IMF's history.
1262	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Prior job cuts have been small by comparison involving considerably less than 100 employees.
1264	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Strauss-Kahn said the overhaul is key to refocusing the IMF's operations and his bid to introduce a new and stronger income model for the 185-country institution.
1265	AFP_ENG_20071207.0235.LDC2009T13	Without quickly reforming its operations and cutting jobs, the IMF could face a funding shortfall of 400 million dollars by 2010, the magazine article, which was posted on the IMF's website, warned.

1277	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and several other major companies issued warnings this past week that fourth-quarter results will miss expectations.
1278	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Wall Street barely noticed.
1279	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	For weeks, analysts have said the long period of stellar earnings growth might be over for U.S. companies, that the 18 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth for Standard &amp

1292	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That matches the historical averages, Dropsey said.
1293	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Of the 31 companies, those that have beaten expectations have done so by an average of 8 percent.
1294	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	This is still well above the norm of a 3 percent rise, according to Thomson Financial.
1295	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Measuring the pace of profit warnings has also been a good way to judge how the quarter will turn out.
1296	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	As of Thursday, 156 companies pre-announced results -- 37 said they'd be above projections, 26 said they were in line with estimates, and 93 announced they would miss.
1297	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Even adding AMD and other recent warnings, Wall Street is still faring slightly better than it did in the third quarter.
1298	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	During that period, 177 pre-announced -- 53 said they would beat expectations, 23 said they'd be in line, and 101 said they'd miss.
1299	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Although these are extremely early indicators, it suggests the fourth quarter remains on par with the previous quarter.

1301	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	P 500 during the third quarter, it is still expected to blow past the historical average of 7.6 percent.
1302	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	Portfolio managers say what has come out so far hasn't been significantly negative or positive, and that double-digit growth is still achievable.

1308	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"The expectations for profit growth already were ratcheted down, but we're now seeing some leeway in that," he said.
1309	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	"Even if you have a few of these disappointments like with AMD, that's still not enough to change expectations that profit will decelerate below expectations."

1312	APW_ENG_20070112.1625.LDC2009T13	That means the potential for sharp growth in the index as a whole could come from a few key sectors, like financial services stocks, Dropsey said.

1380	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	There are growing signs the coordinated interest rate reductions announced last week, and massive liquidity boosts by central banks, are beginning to reduce lending rates between banks.
1381	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The interbank lending rate for three-month dollar loans fell for the fifth day running, the first weekly decline in three months.
1382	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It dropped 0.08 percent to 4.42 percent, while the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, fell almost 0.045 percentage points to 5.045 percent.
1383	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rates are falling, the differential between the rate at which banks lend to each other and official central bank lending rates remain high, signalling a strong degree of mistrust still exists.
1384	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	In the U.S. the base central bank rate is 1.5 percent, while in the euro area it stands at 3.75 percent.

1387	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Though the rescue packages have helped alleviate the pressures on the banking system, threats in the financial system remain, from credit default swaps -- which insure against defaults on securities -- from the insurance sector and from emerging markets.
1388	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Following the bailout of the banks, investor concerns have moved onto the insurance sector.

1391	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Concerns about the global economic outlook have taken their toll on oil prices in recent days, which fell Thursday to near 14-month lows below US$70 before recovering US$1.92 Friday to US$71.77.
1393	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Both had suffered major drops Thursday when oil prices dropped steeply.
1394	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Despite Friday's rise, oil prices are half what they were just three months ago and that is weighing on countries dependent on oil exports, such as Russia.
1395	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	Its indexes continued their losing streak on Friday, with the MICEX dropping 4.3 percent and the RTS down 6.48 percent.
1397	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The index was still far from recouping Thursday's 11.4 percent loss -- its biggest one-day percentage drop since the stock market crash of October 1987.
1398	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	For the week, the Nikkei gained 5 percent, much better than the 24 percent it lost last week.

1411	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
1413	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference is the need for quantified national emission targets for industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the next 10-15 years.
1414	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The IPCC suggests that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the range of 25-40 percent by 2020 is necessary in order to keep the earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsus.
1415	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
1416	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
1417	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted by enthusiastic applause.
1419	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed on Monday how the Adaptation Fund will operate, including its governing body, functions, secretariat, trustee and other institutional arrangements.
1420	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an interim arrangement up for review every three years was a surprise to me," says one observer.
1421	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"I think most of us are delighted to have finalized the Fund whether you like the precise details or not," adds another.
1422	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with regard to developing countries.
1423	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
1424	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
1425	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to.
1426	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
1428	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	During these last three days of the conference, Environment Ministers will seek to reach agreement on the shape of a future international climate pact, the so- called " Bali roadmap".

1431	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	A nonprofit group has started briefing departments and agencies on the importance of properly "onboarding" new employees, after releasing a report showing that the government and new employees could benefit from well-run orientations.
1432	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
1433	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.
1435	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	"There's some set of folks that are leaving because it was not a good fit, but you can also infer that there are some who are leaving because they were not effectively engaged by their employer," he said.

1457	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	The militant al-Qaida group announced Thursday the imminent arrival of a new video message from American-born Islamist Adam Gadahn, making it the first message from the organization in 2008.
1458	APW_ENG_20080103.1016.LDC2009T13	"Coming soon by the will of God, an invitation to reflection and repentance," read the banner produced by al-Sahab, al-Qaida's media wing, and displayed on a militant Web site.

1465	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
1466	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax returns released by the campaign late Friday.
1468	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	He's also raked in $29.6 million from his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned tepid reviews.
1469	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
1470	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The documents released Friday illustrate a remarkable financial turnaround, thanks to speaking fees, lucrative book contracts and deals with a pair of businessmen who have paid more than $15 million to the former president.
1472	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one- page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the past three years).
1473	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
1474	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her 2002 autobiography "Living History."
1475	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
1476	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons gave more than $10 million, or about 9.5 percent of their gross income, to charity, the records show, paying more than $33.8 million in taxes.
1477	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to various accounts.
1478	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	John Kerry is the richest senator with a net worth estimated at $211 million.
1479	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about $3.9 million from 2000 to 2007.
1480	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
1481	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
1482	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
1483	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.
1484	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.
1485	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Uncollected interest estimates required by the Internal Revenue Service indicate the loans were substantial, possibly in excess of $100,000, according to accountants.
1486	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The Clintons made interest-free loans to some of their family members," said Carson.
1487	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The loans ... are personal
1488	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons are going to respect their family members' privacy."
1491	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The tax returns show Gupta's company paid Clinton $800,000 in the last two years, far less than the $3.3 million in payments Clinton was said to have received in an investor lawsuit.
1492	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Carson did not return a request for a comment about Gupta.

1495	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Plague could break out in quake-hit areas if victims' bodies were not buried soon, a local official told Xinhua on Thursday.
1497	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Since the destructive earthquake on Monday, Bai has been searching for survivors with a rescue team in Yingxiu of Wenchuan County, epicenter of the quake.
1498	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	High temperatures would quicken the rotting of bodies, and plague would break out, he warned.
1499	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Some bodies are put together on the ground in the town, and there is already bad smell in the air.
1500	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We are in urgent need of body bags," Bai said, adding there is an urgent need for food and water.
1501	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"Air-dropped food and drinking water are limited and far from meeting the demand," he said.
1502	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said some survivors have fetched water from a mountain spring, but it is unclear if the water is safe for drinking.
1504	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	He said the bodies of the dead would be handled properly as soon as possible to prevent harmful bacteria from growing.
1505	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	"We should not add to the losses caused by natural disasters and let people suffer more just because we have not done our job well," said Gao.
1507	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	Large-sized rescue equipments, including heavy-lifting gear, excavators, and bulldozers, and large number of troops would be sent into the epicenter, an officer with the Chengdu Military Area said.
1508	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	At 8:20 p.m., the air force also began to airdrop large-sized rescue equipments to Yingxiu.
1509	XIN_ENG_20080515.0315.LDC2009T13	The equipment would improve the efficiency of rescue missions carried out by the army, the military source said.

1524	AFP_ENG_20070718.0107.LDC2009T13	The case has dominated headlines in Spain this week.

1531	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
1532	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a pediatrician and father of two young boys.
1533	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Kids with colds were getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either effective or safe."
1534	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
1535	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The case has also raised many questions: How could the products remain on the market for so long without proof they work?
1536	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
1537	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the medical establishment warn parents?
1538	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Are there other medicines in a similar situation?
1539	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
1540	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
1541	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to children that have never been tested in children," Michael Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
1542	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
1543	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group.
1544	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You're just left scratching your head about how this could go on for so long."
1545	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the market before government requirements for stringent testing, and it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in children.
1546	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had authority to regulate them closely.
1547	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
1548	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
1549	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
1550	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The over-the-counter drug review was never made a priority in the agency, and so it dragged on for years and years."
1551	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
1552	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
1553	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
1555	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"We now understand that we can organize studies in children and don't have to extrapolate from adults.
1556	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But that wasn't the case back then."
1557	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although the agency revisited adult dosing guidelines periodically in the ensuing decades as it finalized a series of monographs regulating the products, no significant changes were made for children and the products never again received any kind of detailed scrutiny.
1558	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions.
1560	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent international project that regularly evaluates medical therapies, reached a similar conclusion in 2004.
1561	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
1562	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Where do parents get a lot of their information?
1563	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	If you are a desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and your kid has a cold what do you do?
1564	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
1567	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I think there was a vacuum in leadership on this issue by the professional societies," Lurie said.
1568	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
1571	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"What has that done?
1572	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In this case we're up against multibillion-dollar industry.
1574	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	We try to do what we can, but there's only so much we can do.
1575	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where are the companies in this?
1576	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
1577	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But Sharfstein and others wonder whether the medical profession could have been more aggressive.
1578	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"When I was trained as a pediatrician it was just accepted that these products had no role.
1579	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
1580	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a fair question why there wasn't a strong regulatory challenge by the profession.
1581	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	They could have justified one.
1582	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But what really stunned us was that this was never really looked at from the legal-regulatory side."
1583	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Using powers it received from two new laws, the FDA has begun demanding some prescription drugs be tested in children before being approved, and it has enticed drug companies to conduct pediatric studies of those already on the market.
1584	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
1585	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
1586	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The FDA is now reviewing last week's recommendations, but because of the history of the products it says any formal action could take years.
1587	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers to organize studies of the products.
1588	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The industry has voluntarily withdrawn products designed for children younger than 2, but it maintains that the remedies are both safe and effective for older children when used properly, blaming the problems primarily on overdoses.
1589	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"If the industry decides to dig in its heels against the clear guidance of the advisory committee I hope the FDA has the ability to stop them," Sharfstein said.
1590	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It's a very small risk, unquestionably.
1591	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But if you don't have evidence that the products work and you have kids who have died from taking them, I don't think there's a role for them."
1595	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"Any such rampant killing of innocent citizens and children is totally not acceptable," he said.
1596	AFP_ENG_20070417.0468.LDC2009T13	"I condemn it in the strongest terms possible."

1727	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If you look, you're gonna find them."
1728	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	According to the reports, rodents gnaw their way into sacks of cat and dog food, pasta and beef packages and loaves of bread.
1729	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Mice and rat droppings are unearthed in storage and other areas that customers do not see.
1730	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Rat and mice carcasses are not uncommon.
1731	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors once discovered two rodent burrows in one supermarket's dairy cooler.
1732	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Inspectors over the years have uncovered rodent-defiled macaroni products, a live rat and a meandering mouse in a fresh corn display.
1733	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Of course, it is the sniveling rat that makes people most squeamish.
1734	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"It is disgusting," said Brian O'Keefe, who has frequented the city's KFC fried chicken and Taco Bell Mexican-American restaurants.
1735	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I mean, rats are supposed to be on the outside.
1736	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	And mice are on the inside.
1737	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	If there's rats inside you got a real serious problem."
1738	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	It's impossible to estimate how many rats there are in New York, experts say, but one popular belief is that there's one for each of the more than 8 million people in the city.
1739	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Whatever the number, the rats have continued to thrive despite the city spending millions to eradicate them.
1740	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The typical New York rat weighs about 1 pound (45 kilograms) and has a very flexible body, making it easy to squeeze though openings as small as a half inch (little more than a centimeter).
1741	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Each year, a female rat can easily bear dozens of offspring that survive, said Frank Gasperini, a pest-control expert.
1742	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	They sometimes bite people, but mostly, they just eat -- at least one ounce of food every 24 hours, according to Bobby Corrigan, a rat expert.
1743	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	That means few food establishments are immune.
1744	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"Even the most famous restaurants can get rats," Gasperini said.
1745	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The city's health department finds evidence of vermin, especially mice, at various eateries, from Caribbean restaurants to kosher food shops.
1746	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Health inspection scores at chain restaurants depend on the location.
1747	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Jessica Leighton, the city's deputy commissioner of environmental health, said sloppy sanitation can attract rodents.
1748	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"The basic message is, you need to remove food sources," she said.
1749	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"In restaurants, rodents are a symptom of poor sanitation."
1750	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Eisenberg, the exterminator, said wiping out vermin is impossible.
1751	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	His company kills about 50,000 rats and 250,000 a mice a year in the city, but it's a war that can't be won -- only managed.
1752	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC-Taco Bell, said the incident was unacceptable and a violation of its high standards.
1753	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	The company said construction in the building's basement apparently stirred up the rats.
1754	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, passers-by were still stopping to gawk at the now- notorious fast food joint.
1755	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	West was one of them.
1756	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	She said she'd never eat there again.
1757	APW_ENG_20070225.0071.LDC2009T13	"I think this restaurant is pretty much done," she said.

1817	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Massey Energy Co.'s chief executive threatened to shoot an ABC News producer and tore his shirt collar when the newsman made an unannounced attempt to interview him in the coal company's parking lot, a network spokesman said Thursday.
1818	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	But CEO Don Blankenship said the scuffle happened after the producer put a camera too close to his face.
1820	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	The two were photographed vacationing in Monaco in July 2006 while Massey had cases pending before the court.
1822	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship then moved quickly toward the producer, grabbed his camera and snapped off a microphone before putting his hand's to the man's throat and tearing his shirt collar, Schneider said.
1823	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship offered a different version of events, saying the producer followed his Cadillac into the parking lot, got out, trained a camera on him and put it too close to his face.
1824	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	"I reached up and moved the camera aside a little bit and he took great offense," he said.
1825	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said the producer grabbed his arm and he grabbed the producer's chest to keep his balance.
1826	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Blankenship said he moved the producer toward his car and repeatedly asked him to leave.
1827	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said he does not remember saying the producer might be shot, though he does not dispute that comment.
1828	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Schneider said the producer attempted the interview in the parking lot of Blankenship's office in eastern Kentucky after unsuccessful attempts to arrange a face to face meeting.
1829	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	He said ABC also interviewed Maynard and expects to run the story next week.
1830	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Neither side plans to press charges.
1831	APW_ENG_20080403.1144.LDC2009T13	Based in Richmond, Virginia, Massey is the nation's fourth- largest coal producer by revenue.
1836	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Public Accounts Committee, composed of government and opposition lawmakers, said the 1.6 billion ringgit ($454 million) deal to purchase 12 EC725 helicopters from Eurocopter followed correct procedures.
1837	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee investigated opposition accusations that the price was too high and the negotiations did not go through proper channels -- even though the deal was scrapped last week because of budget constraints amid the global economic crisis.
1839	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"If there were any wrongdoings, we would have figured it out.
1840	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	But there was nothing that was obvious enough."
1841	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The committee discussed the deal with Defense and Finance ministry officials after opposition politicians claimed there were irregularities in the tender process and that the price tag was too high.
1843	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The Eurocopters were meant to replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky helicopters, renamed Nuri by the Malaysians.
1844	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	But Abdullah announced last Tuesday that he was suspending the deal because of the financial crisis.
1845	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	He said the government would use the money for other public projects.
1846	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	Tian Chua, an opposition lawmaker with the People's Justice Party, said the inquiry's conclusions did not quell doubts about the price tag because the panel looked only at procedural issues.
1847	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"It does not mean that at each step (the government) made the right decision," he said.
1848	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of unanswered questions."
1849	APW_ENG_20081104.0126.LDC2009T13	The country's Anti-Corruption Agency is also probing the deal.
1852	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	With a round that included six birdies and a bogey, Parnevik sits atop the leaderboard at 14-under 126.

1858	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	He's going to shoot four or five under everyday if the weather is going to continue being like this."
1859	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	Jacobson made his presence felt on Friday afternoon, firing a five-under 65 en route to a 131 overall.
1860	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	Johnson notched a four- under 66 on the tournament's second day.

1862	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	Parnevik is looking for his first PGA Tour victory since the 2001 Honda Classic.
1863	AFP_ENG_20071006.0398.LDC2009T13	"I think the course has played very easy," Parnevik said.

1925	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some people are harder to read than others, and no one clue is foolproof.
1926	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	So participants are taught to treat the clues as a "working hypothesis" that will evolve with future interactions.
1927	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who speaks in long, complex sentences and focuses on future possibilities, for example, is probably intuitive, a description based on the Jungian model of personality types.
1928	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	When dealing with such a person, emphasize the larger picture and avoid too many details.
1929	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	A person who talks in short, concise sentences responds precisely to what is said, and uses down-to- earth speech is probably a so-called sensor.
1930	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Sensors are best reached by avoiding theories and stressing concrete benefits.
1931	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	In many ways, consciously or not, all of us make these subtle tweaks in our communication styles all the time.
1932	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But we often do this by trial and error, and only after repeated personality conflicts that finally force a new approach.
1933	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	SpeedReading People aims to make this process instinctive and immediate, so we don't reach a point of exasperation before realizing that our method of communicating is at odds with someone else's.
1935	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"We're just helping them learn it earlier and easier."
1936	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	The program also cautions not to assume that someone you have trouble communicating with is simply dense or difficult.
1937	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That can lead to what Garrison, of Vertex, calls "unconscious incompetence," or unproductive interactions that inhibit progress and workplace success.
1938	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	At Vertex, which is hiring new employees at a rate of about one person per business day, innovation is critical to the company's mission of developing drugs that treat devastating diseases.
1939	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	That means its workers must be able to communicate effectively with each another, since poor communication impedes innovation, Garrison said.
1941	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	During a conversation with a coworker about a major change to a complicated laboratory process, Wilson, who describes himself as a theoretical thinker, realized that his detail-oriented colleague seemed to want a more step-by-step explanation.
1942	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"I was having a discussion on a very high conceptual level with a person who really needed a lot more detail and a more linear progression of ideas," recalled Wilson, 39, who has worked at the company for five years.
1943	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"So I essentially conveyed the same information but in a completely different way - from the details up instead of from the top down - and I think he gained a much better understanding of what I was getting at."
1944	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Many other behavior-training programs focus on helping participants identify personality types, particularly their own, but few emphasize the practical application of this knowledge.
1945	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	By having participants watch video interviews, role play, and use online tools, SpeedReading People teaches not only how to categorize other people's temperaments, but how to communicate more effectively with them.
1946	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Some personality types are obvious.
1947	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Extraverts tend to be high- energy, outgoing, talkative people, so it's beneficial to communicate verbally with them and keep the conversation lively.
1948	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Introverts tend to be reserved, private, quiet, and introspective, so it's advantageous to communicate with them in writing first if possible and give them time to reflect.
1949	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Other communication differences are more nuanced.
1950	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a coworker who frequently questions your decisions, he may not simply be an aggressive jerk
1951	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	he may be an intuitive thinker who loves debate and wants to understand your thought process.
1952	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be assertive with him and avoid taking his remarks personally.
1953	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	If you have a boss who rarely smiles and never seems to break out of work mode, she may not be socially inept
1954	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	she may be a so- called sensor-judger who doesn't like to combine work and play.
1955	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Be formal and direct with her.
1956	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	Behavioral clues are best picked up in face-to-face interaction, which isn't always practical in this Internet era.
1957	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	But even a highly detailed e-mail or a terse, clipped phone call can offer insights into another person's personality.
1958	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	And those insights are helpful in both personal and professional contexts, no matter what your family life or work situation.
1959	NYT_ENG_20070723.0163.LDC2009T13	"It's basically important for anyone for whom relationships are important," said Toomey, "and if that doesn't capture everyone, then there's something wrong."

1990	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"But, unfortunately, in that part of the world there are some matters that are beyond anyone's control."

1998	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	Yet concerns remain.

2003	APW_ENG_20080725.0669.LDC2009T13	"There isn't one player I have spoken to who is comfortable about traveling to Pakistan at the moment," Mills said.

2122	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	A series of powerful tornadoes tore across the United States late Saturday, killing at least 21 people and shattering homes and businesses, officials and media said.
2124	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Numerous tornadoes touched down in the evening hours as the storms ripped across Oklahoma at 35-45 miles per hour (55-70 kmh), killing seven in the area near Picher, Oklahoma, the state department of emergency management said.
2125	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Some 150 people were injured.
2126	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The high winds ripped roofs off houses, and other homes were crushed to kindling as the storms downed power lines, utility poles and trees.
2127	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"In some cases, only a home's concrete slab remains," the state said in a statement.
2130	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Picher and all of the other Oklahoma communities that have been impacted by the latest wave of severe weather," Henry told CNN.
2131	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	National Guard troops were called to shut off access to Picher.
2132	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The state said that about 6,300 homes and businesses were without electric power, including 3,000 near Tulsa.
2133	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The storms barrelled eastward and killed one person in the Southeastern state of Georgia in the early morning hours of Sunday, that state's emergency management agency said.
2134	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	The small town of Kite, with some 1,000 residents, was apparently devastated.
2136	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"It experienced significant damage."
2137	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"Many roads are still blocked and impassable," she said.
2138	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"They're having problems with trees in the road, so these are very preliminary estimates, but the town of Kite sustained significant, significant damage."
2139	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	Janak could not confirm whether the storm had spawned any tornadoes.
2140	AFP_ENG_20080511.0177.LDC2009T13	"The National Weather Service will have to send out a survey team to determine that for sure," she said.

2147	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	Prices soared in the first half of the year, reaching record highs above 147 dollars a barrel in July, before a sharp global economic downturn slashed world demand for energy and pulled prices sharply lower.
2148	AFP_ENG_20081231.0515.LDC2009T13	New York crude plunged earlier this month to below 33 dollars, its lowest point for almost five years.

2180	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Experts hope the IMF loan, which amounts to nearly half of the country's current foreign currency reserves, will shore up the shaken financial sector and give the central bank the necessary reserves to defend the falling national currency, the hryvna, which has plunged over 20 percent in recent months.
2182	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	The hryvna plunged to a historic low of 6.01 to the dollar last week after a 40 percent fall in exports and a run on banks that stripped the banking sector of $3.4 billion this month as Ukrainians rushed to convert their savings into dollars.
2183	APW_ENG_20081027.0493.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Ukraine is in for a painful economic downturn.

2198	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	They're clunky, heavy and ugly, but they have become modish -- and they are not this season's platform shoes.
2199	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A year after the introduction of the sturdy gray bicycles known as Velib's, they are being used all over Paris.
2201	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	About 20,600 Velib' bicycles are in service here, with more than 1,450 self-service rental stations.
2202	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The stations are only some 300 yards apart, and there are four times as many as there are subway stations, even in a city so well served by its metro system.
2203	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	In the first year, the city says, there have been 27.5 million trips in this city of roughly 2.1 million people, many of them for daily commutes.
2204	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	On average, there are 120,000 trips a day.
2205	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	And on July 27, at the conclusion here of the Tour de France, 365 lucky Velib' riders will be chosen to ride along for a while and cross the finish line.
2206	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	There are a Velib' Web site, Velib' fashions and a Velib' blog (www.blog.velib.paris.fr/blog)

2208	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A kind of Velib' behavior has emerged, especially at the morning rush, with people swiftly checking for bikes in the best condition: tires inflated, chains still attached, baskets unstolen.
2210	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	She uses a Velib' two or three times a day, saying, "I love it

2212	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The Velib' -- a contraction of velo for bike and liberte -- can also be rented for a day or for a week, with a 150 euro (about $239) deposit taken from the user's credit card if the bike is not returned.
2213	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	Usage fees over 30 minutes can rise steeply: Two hours cost 7 euros (about $11).

2230	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
2231	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
2232	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
2233	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss' instruction.
2236	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby has pleaded not guilty, contending he misspoke and forgot about conversations he had with journalists amid the crush of his duties.
2237	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	He is not charged with the leak itself.
2239	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
2240	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
2241	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
2242	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney insisted that the administration had significant evidence that Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
2244	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.
2246	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``As late as last October, the considered judgment of the intel community was that SH (Saddam Hussein) had indeed undertaken a vigorous effort to acquire uranium from Africa, according to NIE (the National Intelligence Estimate),'' she wrote.
2247	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
2250	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby later came to her seat in the back of the plane, holding a handwritten card with notes he said were Cheney's instructions about what to say to Cooper.
2251	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
2252	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
2254	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
2256	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``I did not have a conversation with the vice president about that,'' Martin responded.
2260	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	For an additional fee of 395 kroner (53 euros, 72 dollars), the club also offers to pay up to four parking tickets a year, totalling no more than 2,000 kroner (269 euros, 367 dollars).
2261	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"The increasing number of speed checks with fines ranging between 500 and 7,000 kroner and more could lead to unexpected costs that could seriously harm many people's personal finances," the club wrote on its website.
2262	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	It estimated that 250,000 people had received speeding fines in 2006.

2268	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
2269	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Presidential candidates are collecting contributions at a record- setting pace and are racing to load their schedules with fundraising events ahead of March 31, the campaign's first deadline for filing financial reports.
2270	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
2271	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.
2273	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
2274	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
2275	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Not a single day in March will pass without at least one 2008 contender personally making a major push for funds.
2276	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
2277	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's almost a geometric increase,'' said Michael Toner, who left his post as a member of the Federal Election Commission last week.
2278	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Campaigns are also aggressively trying to manage expectations, providing low-ball estimates of what they will raise while exaggerating predictions for their opponents.
2279	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
2281	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
2284	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.

2289	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama is holding low-dollar ``kickoff'' fundraisers in cities nationwide, including a $100-per-ticket fundraiser in Denver and a $25-per-ticket event in Oklahoma City in recent days, and a $100-per-ticket event in West Palm Beach this weekend.
2290	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	At a recent breakfast in Cambridge, Mass., Obama spoke to about two dozen young venture capitalists -- many of them political novices -- in an effort to tap new pools of money rather than engage in a zero-sum game with Clinton.
2291	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
2293	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.
2294	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama's rivals argue that his ability to hold multimillion-dollar events in New York and Los Angeles belie the campaign's claim that his is simply a grass-roots movement without major financial players.

2302	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In between, the former president was scheduled to attend a fundraising reception, at the home of Sheila and Jay Kaplowitz in Philadelphia.

2308	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In a significant change, strategists on both sides of the aisle agree, Democratic contenders could wind up with more money than their Republican counterparts.
2309	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Still, GOP benchmarks exist.
2311	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Early on, Romney impressed insiders by collecting more than $6 million in a single call-athon day in Boston, but one strategist said he has not heard much since from the former governor.

2318	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Allies of McCain have argued that he got a late start on raising money.
2319	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	McCain had been unofficially running for months, if not years, before that announcement.
2320	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His first major event was on March 2 in Phoenix, and was the first in a series of ``Exchange of Ideas'' fundraisers in which the crowd is allowed to question the candidate.

2400	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's squad.
2401	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	He said they tried to run from the car, instead of obeying an order not to.

2405	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The Washington Post.

2434	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	It said economic expansion would speed up next year.
2435	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the government similarly increased its growth forecast to 4.6 percent.
2436	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Industrial output grew a higher-than-expected 6.6 percent in May while exports in June grew 15.9 percent year-on-year to a record 32.3 billion dollars.
2437	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	Inflation was 2.5 percent in June due to global oil price rises, accelerating from 2.3 percent in May.
2438	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The June figure, however, stayed within the central bank's target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for 2007-09.
2439	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answers to Home-Care Questions
2440	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Question: Once in 2002, and again in 2006, I have had the wall- to-wall carpeting in my co-op professionally cleaned.
2441	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
2442	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	(By the way, I don't smell anything.)
2443	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid over a concrete slab and that's the problem.
2444	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
2445	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	So I am wondering, if they put in new carpeting, won't the problem -- moisture being retained in the carpeting -- just resurface in a few years?
2446	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What else can be done?
2447	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
2448	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	There are two popular tests to detect concrete moisture: One involves taping a plastic sheet to the concrete, then measuring the humidity in the covered space after 24 hours.
2449	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
2450	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet of floor in a 24-hour period.
2451	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, the acceptable level is 4.5 pounds or less.
2452	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some wood-floor installers have moisture meters, but these devices usually are not good for detecting moisture content in concrete.
2453	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
2454	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I think you have a legitimate concern, and I would advise against installing new carpeting in your co-op.
2455	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You are right, in my opinion, in that the carpeting is going to become moldy and musty smelling again.
2456	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now, what are your options?
2457	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Well, let's assume your building is older and that the concrete has been in place for some time.
2458	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If that's the case, then the high moisture content is not because the concrete is curing.
2459	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I would suggest installing a tile floor, which will allow some moisture from the slab to rise through into the living space.
2460	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To deal with the moisture from the slab, use one or two dehumidifiers.
2461	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
2462	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	If it were me, I'd fight having wall-to-wall carpeting installed a second time.
2463	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q.: I've lived in my home for 48 years.
2464	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
2465	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
2466	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
2467	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What's the truth?
2468	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
2469	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``That's too much,'' he said.
2470	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is to look for the white stones in the asphalt.
2471	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	When you can see the white stones, then it's time.''
2472	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
2473	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Hope that helps.
2474	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a problem with clover.
2475	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
2476	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Also what's the best way, organically, to deal with ants on a patio?
2477	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
2478	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I tend to have a lot of clover in the back yard, but I find it's really soft on the feet and, well, I guess I kind of like it, too.
2479	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
2480	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
2481	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told by organic experts that, depending on the amount of clover, the lawn should be dominant after a season or two.
2482	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin.
2483	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Ants don't like certain plants, including tansy and pennyroyal, and the dried powders of these plants do a good job of chasing ants away.
2484	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
2485	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.
2486	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Pyrethrum powders also are excellent in repelling ticks, silverfish, flies and spiders.
2487	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	I'm told it can be dusted on animals to kill fleas, lice and ticks, but I'd certainly check with your vet before applying to any household pets.

2494	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Another attack on Shiite pilgrims marching to the holy city of Karbala killed at least four people on Monday, just a day after a suicide bombing left 52 dead.
2497	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	At least 57 pilgrims have been killed during two days of attacks and more than 100 have been wounded.
2501	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Farther south, neither the continuing violence nor the rainstorms that swept over central Iraq on Monday stopped the thousands of Shiite pilgrims walking along highways, bearing red, green and black banners to the Shrine of Imam Hussein in Karbala for the Arbaeen observance.
2505	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, the Babel provincial police chief reassigned the Iskandariya police chief and staged joint raids with U.S. officials in neighborhoods near the attack.
2507	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Violence also swept through Diyala province, just north of Baghdad.
2510	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Elsewhere in Diyala province, U.S. forces in Khan Bani Sad killed a suspected insurgent during a raid.
2513	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	Troops had sought the son in the raid, but Beshara was detained as well after an unauthorized machine gun was found on the premises, the report said.
2516	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	The ambassador said in a telephone interview: "This operation will be limited in size, scope and duration.
2517	NYT_ENG_20080225.0148.LDC2009T13	It has one target and one target alone and that is PKK terrorist organization."

2522	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	DAVID STOUT CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.
2523	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
2526	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence of what it calls a systemic failure.
2528	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the current CIA director, and his predecessor, Porter J. Goss, have declined to seek disciplinary action against Tenet and others named in the report.
2529	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The basic outlines of the report have been known since shortly after it was completed in 2005, but it had never been made public, and its release reignited a debate about whether the CIA should have done more before the attacks, and whether Tenet and other officials should be held accountable.
2531	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.
2532	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The summary of the report was released at the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
2533	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The bitter dispute surrounding the report's release suggests the depth of anger that remains, nearly six years after the fact, over where blame should be assigned for the intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
2534	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Among the lawmakers who voiced renewed anger at the CIA's decision not to discipline anyone was Rep. Rush D. Holt, D-N.J., a member of the House intelligence committee.
2539	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of their errors amount to misconduct.
2540	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
2541	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It cited "failures to implement and manage important processes, to follow through with operations and to properly share and analyze critical data."
2542	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report does not cite the names of the officials who it says "did not discharge their responsibilities in a satisfactory manner," but it identifies some of them by their titles.
2544	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	J. Cofer Black, the former director of the agency's Counterterrorist Center
2545	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	and other top CIA officials at the time of the attacks.
2546	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
2547	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
2548	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The report cited the CIA's failure to pass intelligence about al- Mihdhar and al-Hamzi to other agencies as potentially significant.
2549	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The CIA had identified the two men in January 2000 when they visited Malaysia, but never notified the State Department to put them on the terrorist watch list.
2551	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure, and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida.
2552	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In his statement on Tuesday, Tenet outlined a further defense, that the CIA's counterterrorism efforts were embodied in "a robust plan, marked by extraordinary effort and dedication" long before Sept. 11, 2001.
2554	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report released on Tuesday included new detail about what it calls a strained relationship between the CIA under Tenet and the National Security Agency, which was then led by Hayden.
2555	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said the standoff had prevented CIA officials from gaining access to transcripts of intercepted communications between terrorism suspects, and criticized Tenet for not interceding to resolve these turf battles.
2556	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In describing the period prior to the Sept. 11 attacks, the report said the CIA had carried out "no comprehensive analysis that put into context the threats received in the spring and summer of 2001."
2557	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
2558	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	As a result, it said, too little attention had been paid to allegations that Mohammed was "sending terrorists to the United States to engage in activities on behalf of bin Laden."
2559	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a note to agency employees on Tuesday, Hayden made it clear that he continued to oppose the report's release.
2560	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	"It will, at a minimum, consume time and attention revisiting ground that is already well plowed," he said.
2564	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.

2567	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	Peter Fulton has been elevated to the opening slot vacated by the injured Lou Vincent as New Zealand seeks a quick solution ahead of Thursday's Super 8s game against the West Indies.
2570	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"Peter's been in outstanding form," said Fleming, referring to the batsman who came to the World Cup with half-centuries in three of his last four innings, but missed out on some preliminary round matches.
2571	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"It was an incredibly difficult decision to leave Peter out of the first few games," said Fleming.
2572	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"He's now getting a bat in one position for a while."
2573	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	In his previous 29 one-dayers, the 28-year-old Fulton's position kept switching between No.3 and No.4.
2575	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	McCullum had been tried as an opener by New Zealand, but then shifted back to the middle order where he had more success with the bat.
2576	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	Vincent's replacement in the squad will be Hamish Marshall, who was permitted by the International Cricket Council's technical committee to fill in for Vincent.
2578	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	Fleming said the squad's balance had changed with these injuries.
2579	APW_ENG_20070327.1738.LDC2009T13	"But the core is still there," he said.
2582	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman said that the problems in the economy and markets "are large and complex, but in my judgment, our government now has the tools it needs to confront and solve them."
2583	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke said the crisis "has many novel aspects" stemming from the globalization of markets and quick movements of money and information but that "the current situation also has much in common with past experiences."
2585	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in markets and financial institutions.
2587	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away," Bernanke said.
2588	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Economic activity had been decelerating even before the recent intensification of the crisis.
2589	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The housing market continues to be a primary source of weakness in the real economy as well as in the financial markets, and we have seen marked slowdown in consumer spending, business investment and the labor market.
2590	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Credit markets will take some time to unfreeze."
2591	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke added that the overall recovery "will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning."
2594	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke meanwhile expressed confidence in the longer-term outlook once the credit and banking problems are fixed.
2595	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"I strongly believe that we now have the tools we need to respond with the necessary force to these challenges," he said.

2607	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	"The objective of the security forces is to further aggravate tensions and it shows the government's claims that it is not targeting Sadr supporters to be false," he added.

2616	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Shanshal said the recent strategies "under the pretext of implementing law" were actually sowing the seeds of hatred.

2641	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"The difference in time is really important because the challenge is to warn people away from the coastline within minutes.
2642	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	It takes 10 to 20 minutes before a tsunami hits the coastline," he said.
2643	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	"If you have the information this soon after the earthquake hits, you could get information to hotels and villages and avert a potential disaster."
2646	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	The software system, called the "SeisComP", has been installed at various points around Indonesia as part of a new warning system that should be completed by 2008, he said.
2647	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	One of two components that must still be added to the detection system is a way of measuring where in the ocean a tsunami begins and where it will hit the coast.
2648	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	Zschau said the software had only been installed in recent weeks and his group was "relieved" that it passed a baptism of fire in the series of powerful quakes that has struck in the Pacific around Indonesia since late Wednesday.
2649	AFP_ENG_20070913.0346.LDC2009T13	At least 10 people have died and some 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed, but fears that large-scale destruction mirroring the events of 2004 have so far proved unfounded.

2654	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	U.S. retail sales fell by 0.9 percent in June, the sharpest plunge since August 2005, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
2655	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The drop in retail sales for June followed an increase of 1.5 percent in May.
2656	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	In June, sales of autos and auto parts dropped by 2.9 percent, after a 1.1-percent gain in the previous month.
2657	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Sales at furniture stores were down 3.0 percent, the biggest plunge since February 2003, following a small rise of 0.3 percent in May.
2658	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, sales at hardware stores fell by 2.3 percent, while sales at specialty clothing stores declined by 1.4 percent.
2659	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Department stores saw sales fall by 1 percent.
2660	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Gasoline stations saw sales drop by 1.1 percent, a decline attributed to a temporary fall in gasoline prices in June.
2661	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	Excluding auto and parts sales, total retail sales would have fallen by 0.4 percent, the weakest performance in this category since last September.
2662	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The performance in retail sales reflects the situation of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity and is a major force pushing economic growth.
2663	XIN_ENG_20070713.0196.LDC2009T13	The June drop in retail sales was much sharper than the flat reading expected by economists and raised new worries about consumer spending, according to analysts.

2759	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	The company, with offices in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, closed this month and is filing for bankruptcy, its lawyers say.
2760	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of couples have been left with no visual record of their wedding day, and many brides-to-be who had made down payments now have no wedding photographers lined up.
2761	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	So instead of paging through their albums, newlyweds are filing police reports and lawsuits, and sifting through posts on Internet bulletin boards.
2762	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	And, along with people who are not yet married but who paid Celebration Studios in advance, they are vetting countless online offers from album makers, video editors and last-minute photographers engaged in what one bride-to-be called "ambulance chasing."
2764	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	It also issued an order to prevent them from selling or disposing of the wedding images that had not been delivered.
2765	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"When you're playing with people's memories, it's not a beautiful thing," said Ruiz de Somocurcio, 30, who has no images from his wedding other than snapshots sent to him by friends.
2766	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Until recently, Celebration Studios had a reputation for producing good work at a reasonable price.
2767	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Couples frequently took advantage of a 10- to 20-percent discount for paying in full in advance.
2768	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Last week, it was offering photography packages priced up to $3,995 and video packages costing up to $2,295 on its Web site, which has since shut down.
2769	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	But the company's fortunes recently plummeted.

2776	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	On Monday, Herrmann said that the copyrights of the images currently belonged to Celebration Studios.
2777	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Schwartz did not respond to e-mail messages sent to two addresses for him, and there was no response to phone messages left for Celebration Studios last week.
2778	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Herrmann said Celebration Studios would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in Newark in the next week.
2779	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	News reports of complaints about the company appeared last week in The Star-Ledger of Newark and on Philadelphia and New York television stations.
2780	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	Photographers say they, too, have been cheated by the company.

2782	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	She eventually got paid, after waiting three months.
2783	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"When you do a wedding, it's a 14-hour day often, and you spend a lot of money in gas and put your whole heart into it, and then you don't even get your gas money back," she said.
2784	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	According to the suit filed by the New Jersey attorney general, Anne Milgram, the nine-year-old company "engaged in the use of unconscionable commercial practices, false promises, misrepresentations and/or the knowing concealment, suppression or omission of material facts."
2786	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"As of 2005, obviously Celebration Studios knew that people were not getting their pictures, and since then they continued soliciting and taking people's money," he said, citing problems at least two years old.
2787	NYT_ENG_20080122.0028.LDC2009T13	"People are giving them their family heirloom photographs and baby pictures, and not getting the pictures of the most important days of their lives."

2799	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	This will be Zvonareva's third final of the year, and fourth since her last title at 2006 Cincinnati.
2800	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She has played two three-set matches in as many days, but said she has the energy to beat Williams.
2801	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I'll just have to stay focused the whole match," Zvonareva said.
2802	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I'll have to not have ups and downs in the match and play as even as possible."
2803	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Fifth-seeded Williams rallied from 4-1 down against the unseeded Cornet in their semifinal.
2804	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams broke Cornet twice at love before taking the set.
2805	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In a second set featuring long baseline rallies, Williams broke Cornet in the eighth game, then held serve at love to take the match.
2806	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"In just the whole match I thought she played really well, and I just wasn't playing my game," Williams said.
2807	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I got caught a little bit on the defensive a lot and I wasn't doing anything I should have been doing."
2809	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She was runner-up earlier this year at Acapulco, her best showing on the tour since joining it last year.
2810	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Saturday was the first time she faced Williams.
2811	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"It was a little bit of a surprise for her because she didn't know me," Cornet said.
2812	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I was like making the pressure on her and it was working and after 4-1, you know, she played better."
2813	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Cornet said she has learned a lesson by reaching two consecutive semifinals.
2814	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I have to fight and I have to play my game, and I think I have the level now for beating the best, so it's a lot of confidence for me," she said.
2815	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams said she will surely be facing Cornet again.
2816	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"She gets a lot of balls back, and those kind of players are usually around for a good 20 years," Williams said.
2817	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Williams, who ousted No. 2 Maria Sharapova in Friday's quarterfinals, won her last two tournaments in Bangalore and Key Biscayne, and was 18-1 on the year.
2819	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Reaching her latest final ensured the eight-time Grand Slam winner passed $19 million (euro12 million) in career earnings for No. 6 on the women's all-time list.
2820	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	She played in the Charleston final previously in 2003, losing to Justine Henin.
2821	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	A day after No. 9-seeded Zvonareva knocked out top seed and defending champion Jelena Jankovic, she broke No. 4 Dementieva for 3-1 in the first set and held on, then rallied from 3-0 down in the second to force a tiebreaker.
2822	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	In the third, Zvonareva again rallied in a match in which she took her chances far better.
2823	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	Zvonareva converted seven of 10 break points, Dementieva only five of 22.
2824	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	"I was just trying to find a way to win the match.
2825	APW_ENG_20080419.0778.LDC2009T13	I kept fighting and I think it worked for me today," Zvonareva said.

2827	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The annual hajj in Saudi Arabia entered its final day on Friday as the last of almost 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims took part in the ritual "stoning of Satan."
2828	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Eager pilgrims who had travelled from across the world thronged around the Jamarat Bridge at Mina east of Mecca from the early hours to throw pebbles at the three massive pillars representing the devil.
2829	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	With cries of "Allahu Akbar" -- God is greater -- echoing around the valley, the vast multitude of hajjis completed the ritual as the ceremony began drawing to a close.
2830	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	People spoke of their joy at completing the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam which all Muslims must undertake once in a lifetime if they have the means to do so.
2831	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	"My husband is blind and we are both very old, but we are glad we're here though we have our disabilty to overcome," said Fozia from Pakistan as she led her elderly partner through the crowd.
2833	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	After throwing their pebbles at the pillars, pilgrims began returning to the Grand Mosque in Mecca before making their trip home.
2834	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	"It was a good release of anger and frustration, especially in our material world.
2836	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of slippers lost during the ritual and empty drinking bottles used by the faithful to carry pebbles littered the three- storey bridge overlooking the pillars.
2837	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	Security forces and medical staff stood by to guard against any repetition of tragedies that have marked the hajj in previous years.
2838	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	There have been no reported deaths or injuries caused by overcrowding at this year's celebrations, but thousands of people have lost their lives during previous pilgrimages, some in stampedes as pilgrims jostled and pushed to get close to Satan's pillars.
2839	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	In January 2006, 364 people were killed in a huge crush during the stoning ceremony, and a similar tragedy in 2004 saw 251 people trampled to death.
2840	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The worst incident was in 1990 when 1,426 people suffocated in a tunnel at Mina after a ventilation system broke down.
2843	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	The pillars at Jamarat are traditionally believed to be the place where the devil appeared to Abraham, his wife Hagar and son Ishmael.
2845	AFP_ENG_20071221.0268.LDC2009T13	His visit had an added political significance because of the sometimes rocky relations between Shiite Iran and Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia, both key players in the Middle East.

2856	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in California, charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the men to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment."
2858	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	He said Jeppesen provides support services, rather than the flights themselves, for airlines, private pilots and companies.

2862	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip."
2863	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause.
2864	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	"Either (Jeppesen) knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said.
2865	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," said Wizner.
2866	APW_ENG_20070531.0102.LDC2009T13	Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit.

2908	XIN_ENG_20071005.0195.LDC2009T13	The fires were spotted at 10:00 a.m. Friday in the forest areas between Heihe City and Yichun City, bordering the Lesser Hinggan Mountains in Heilongjiang Province, said a provincial meteorological bureau spokesman.

2917	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2007-06-08 16:13:46 UTC
2918	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered that Paris Hilton be brought to court Friday for a hearing on her early release from jail rather than listen to the proceeding by telephone.
2919	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer was the latest in a flurry of developments surrounding Hilton's early release from prison.
2920	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That move sparked protests by many -- including local and state authorities and civil rights leaders -- who argued it could interpreted as affording the socialite favors not available to other, less famous, inmates.
2922	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Judge Sauer has instructed the Sheriff's Department to go to Ms. Hilton's residence, pick her up and bring her here.
2923	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	That is happening now," Parachini told reporters outside the courthouse.
2924	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton on Thursday was originally ordered to report to court at 9 a.m. (1600 GMT) and the judge signed an order for deputies to bring her in a sheriff's vehicle from her home, said Allan Parachini.
2925	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	But early Friday, Parachini had announced that she would be allowed to take part in the hearing by telephone.
2926	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
2927	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk at news cameras.
2928	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	One of them was Moses Baltazar who was attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket.
2929	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he was no fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from her.
2930	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.
2931	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"Driving like that, you have to behave.
2932	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	If you're rich, you have money, you have to respect yourself," he said, adding he thinks she should be returned to jail.
2933	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence.
2934	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She had spent three days, and was credited for five.
2935	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton was fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and was expected to finish the sentence for a reckless driving probation violation at her four-bedroom, three-bath home.
2936	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
2937	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention.
2938	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Late Thursday, Sauer issued the order for Hilton to return to court after the city attorney filed a petition demanding that Hilton be returned to jail and to show cause why Baca should not be held in contempt of court.
2939	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca does not have to be in court, and it was unclear who would represent the Sheriff's Department.
2941	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"What transpired here is outrageous," county Supervisor Don Knabe told The Associated Press, adding he received more than 400 angry e-mails and hundreds more phone calls from around the country.
2942	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Hilton's return home "gives the impression of ... celebrity justice being handed out," he said.
2943	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Baca dismissed the criticism, saying the decision was made based on medical advice.
2945	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca said.
2946	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	California Attorney General Jerry Brown criticized the Sheriff's Department for letting Hilton out of jail, saying he believed she should serve out her sentence.
2947	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"It does hold up the system to ridicule when the powerful and the famous get special treatment," Brown told The Associated Press in an interview before testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.
2948	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'm sure there's a lot of people who've seen their family members go to jail and have various ailments, physical and psychological, that didn't get them released," he said.
2949	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"I'd say it's time for a course correction."
2951	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip.
2952	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	As word spread that the 26-year-old poster child for bad celebrity behavior was back home, radio helicopter pilots who normally report on traffic conditions were dispatched to hover over her house and describe it to morning commuters.
2953	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Paparazzi photographers on the ground quickly assembled outside its gates.
2954	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her attorney.

3106	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	There are "major uncertainties" swirling around the economic outlook for the euro zone in 2008, the president of the European Central Bank said.
3107	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	In an interview with EuroNews that aired Friday, Jean-Claude Trichet said that the bank's governing council, which sets interest rates for the 13-nation euro zone, are worried about the risk of weaker growth.
3108	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It is true there are major uncertainties with regard to the economic situation," he said.
3109	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"The council of governors of the ECB feels that there is a greater risk of weaker growth, with it going below around 2 percent."
3110	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	A transcript of the interview, along with a video, was posted on the broadcaster's Web site.
3112	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"France will be hit, like unfortunately all countries, by a lower growth rate," making the government's forecast of a 2.25 percent pace difficult to achieve, he said.
3113	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"It could be that the end of 2008 is a rebound moment if we see after six months that all the accounts have been balanced and confidence returns."
3114	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet, asked why the bank has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent since June, Trichet said the ECB has been acting within its mission to control inflation.
3115	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Our first mandate -- which the treaty requires of us and our fellow citizens demand of us -- is to ensure medium-term price stability is in line with our target, that is inflation of less than 2 percent and around 2 percent," he said.
3116	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"In terms of the 320 million people living in the euro zone we therefore make our monetary policy decisions to ensure price stability.
3117	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	That is our principal mandate."
3118	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Trichet also reiterated previous remarks that the bank would not tolerate the excuse of higher energy and food prices as a reason to increase wages, thus spurring inflation.
3119	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	"Because then, we would have what we call second-round effects, leading to inflation which would be long lasting, instead of being temporary and related to higher costs for oil and raw materials and we would be unable to comply with our mandate, to ensure price stability, and we wouldn't be doing what our fellow citizens expressly ask us to," Trichet said.
3120	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the day, the bank said it would mop up as much as euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion) in a move to drain liquidity from the markets.
3121	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The bank also reaffirmed its intent to keep steering liquidity to a more balanced condition so as to align short-term interest rates with the refinancing minimum bid rate, which is 4 percent.
3122	APW_ENG_20071221.0554.LDC2009T13	The move followed a similar operation on Thursday, that was also for euro150 billion (US$215.24 billion).

3179	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	The number two seed from Chile, who the day before had needed 138 minutes to dispose of Simone Bolelli, was on court for a further 130 minutes before securing his victory.
3181	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Mixing penetrating groundstrokes, frequent use of the dropshot and often playing serve and volley, he immediately recovered a break to level the first set at 3-3 and then broke against for the set with a perfectly executed drop volley.
3182	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Both players had break point opportunities in the second set, before Gulbis netted a weak backhand to give Gonzalez a break for 5-4.
3183	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	But the Chilean failed to serve out the set, and then was also unable to convert any of three break points at 5-5 as the set moved to a dramatic conclusion.
3184	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Gulbis held five match points in the 24-point tiebreak, before a double-fault allowed Gonzalez to level the match on his third set point.
3185	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez quickly established a lead in the deciding set, giving up just four points in the first three games before a final break, to love, left him serving for victory.
3186	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	"There were many match points and he was in control of the match," said Gonzalez.
3187	AFP_ENG_20081008.0139.LDC2009T13	"Most of the time I was the guy who was running and trying to reach some balls, and he was the one who was going for it every time.

3220	XIN_ENG_20070427.0058.LDC2009T13	But major opposition parties like the ANPP and Action Congress claimed that they do not believe and would not accept the election results.

3265	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	To Treat Illegal Migrants or Not, a High-Cost Dialysis Decision
3266	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.
3267	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She has never seen a bill.
3268	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
3269	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs.
3270	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
3271	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
3272	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
3273	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Health services and other benefits available to illegal immigrants can vary by the state.
3275	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
3276	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	With limited federal guidance, states often are left to make their own decisions, frequently shaped by political winds.
3277	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
3278	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The number of patients is not large.
3279	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In California, illegal immigrants account for about 1,350 of the 61,000 people on dialysis.
3280	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Their treatment cost taxpayers $51 million last year.
3281	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
3282	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The investment in a single patient can easily top $1 million over time.
3283	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states draw the line at illegal immigrants.
3284	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
3285	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	That is because patients without regular dialysis frequently end up in emergency rooms.
3286	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
3288	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health, it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue.
3290	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Such patients are at increased risk of heart attacks and infections.

3294	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In grappling with what services to provide for illegal immigrants, some states tip toward the need to care for the sick.
3295	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their presence.
3296	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Congress tried to establish a balance.
3297	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In 1986, it barred illegal immigrants from the federal health benefits generally available to the poor, with one notable exception: emergencies.
3298	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The federal government agreed to share the cost of caring for poor illegal immigrants through state-run Emergency Medicaid programs.
3299	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

3304	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	What's left is an ambiguous policy that the federal government itself has struggled to clarify.
3305	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.
3306	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	If California and other states were using federal funds to help provide routine dialysis, she said, they were mischaracterizing it as an emergency treatment.
3307	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	More recently, she acknowledged that the federal government has been sharing the cost in California for years.
3308	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It has long been left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis, she said.
3310	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Other states have wavered.
3311	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	North Carolina, for example, now provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants.
3314	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The courts haven't cleared up the issue.
3315	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
3316	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
3317	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	In a settlement last year, the state agreed to restore its policy of providing routine dialysis, but the settlement applies only to Arizona.
3319	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of one routine treatment is about $250.
3320	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
3321	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	To advocates of stricter immigration controls, such comparisons miss the point.
3323	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will lure more sick people from other countries.
3325	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
3326	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Now, a free transportation service picks her up three days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
3327	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"If I go home, I won't be able to afford this," said Aquino, 56.
3328	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"No way am I going home."
3329	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California, but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand the gravity of their plight.
3330	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
3331	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid program does not.
3333	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals pay for plane tickets back.
3334	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Mexico offers dialysis to those who can afford it, but access is far more limited for the poor.
3335	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
3336	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
3337	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
3338	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"I have friends who have died because of lack of dialysis," said Lopez, a longtime diabetic who arrived in the U.S. four years ago while her kidneys were still functioning.
3339	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal immigrants.
3340	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
3341	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three dialysis-free years.
3342	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Critics, however, say that dipping into the organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are waiting.
3343	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"It's not like you go to Costco and pick up a kidney," Krikorian said.
3344	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
3345	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She said she is grateful for the care she has received in California.
3346	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.
3347	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents in Mexico, she has never returned.
3348	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be able to get back.
3349	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	STARBUCKS PLANS RETURN TO ITS ROOTS
3350	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
3352	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The initiatives are intended to restore an authentic coffeehouse experience to the company's stores and, in turn, re-energize an ailing stock that has lost half its value in the last 15 months.
3353	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow customers to see baristas making their beverage.
3354	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He said the company would roll out the Swiss-made Mastrena machines to three- fourths of Starbucks stores by 2010.
3355	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one cup at a time.
3356	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The price was not disclosed.
3357	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will roll out Clover systems in select markets.
3358	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz described a host of other plans: a pungent new coffee blend, a partnership with Conservation International to certify environmentally responsible whole-bean espresso products, and a rewards program for users of the Starbucks customer card.
3359	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Beginning in mid-April, users of the customer card will be able to customize their drinks -- with soy milk or vanilla, for example -- at no cost.
3360	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The announcements are intended to help Starbucks hang on to customers in the face of intensifying competition for brewed coffee from Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's, which is widely introducing espresso beverages this year.
3361	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This was more of a position statement.
3363	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	amp
3364	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Co. "They are saying, 'We are not going to change who we are, we are going to defend turf aggressively."'
3365	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters.
3366	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"A lot of people are making unique claims about coffee and what they do," he said.
3367	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"What's interesting to me is that they are not coffee roasters."
3368	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	But Schultz tried largely to keep the focus on the company's internal challenges and future moves.
3369	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time the U.S. business is under pressure.
3370	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	It's a character test," he said.
3371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
3372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
3373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
3374	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Don't believe the media hype.
3375	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	There's no coffee war going on.
3376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
3377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
3378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
3379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
3380	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis.
3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
3382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the face of those pressures, Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago.
3383	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He quickly announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least profitable Starbucks stores in the United States.
3384	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He also said Starbucks would stop selling a line of breakfast sandwiches that were served warm, creating an aroma that overwhelmed that of the coffee in stores.
3385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the company's early devotion to high-quality coffee.
3386	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The new coffee blend, called Pike Place Roast, is a reference to the location of the first Starbucks store.
3387	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks will introduce the blend in stores next month.
3388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Baristas will be directed to brew smaller batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30 minutes.
3389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
3390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
3391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community, mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will contribute to a corporate blog.
3392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Customers will also be encouraged to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with employees.
3393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
3394	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
3395	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
3396	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
3397	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The last innovation widely thought to be successful was the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
3398	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz partly has his own relentless ambition to blame for the woes at Starbucks.
3399	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the last two years, citing ever-larger expansion goals, the company doubled its number of stores to more than 15,000 in 44 countries -- many in comically close proximity to one another and to competing coffee shops.
3400	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
3401	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
3402	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
3403	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event as early as 6 a.m.
3404	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	As a barbershop quartet sang and employees dressed in Starbucks' green aprons handed out free coffee, many shareholders expressed excitement over Schultz's return.
3405	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I'm glad Howard is back at the helm.
3406	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks is his heart," said Jan Melin, a retiree and shareholder from Seattle who was there with her husband, Bill.
3407	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"I have every confidence he will turn the company around so this stock can take our family on our 50th wedding anniversary trip next year."

3410	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The Bank of Canada took an unusual step Thursday of publicly reassuring investors that it will help provide stability to financial markets and the domestic financial system.
3412	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	Although these activities are part of the bank's normal operations, it affirmed that it is closely monitoring developments, and will deal with issues as they arise.
3413	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The bank's increased participation in the money markets stems from Thursday's turbulent Canadian and U.S. stock market activity.
3415	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	That sent stocks lower in Europe and the United States as investors looked for safer havens such as Treasurys.
3417	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	STARBUCKS REPORTS 28 PERCENT DROP IN PROFIT AND TRIMS STORE OPENINGS
3418	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO
3419	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Facing an increasingly stingy consumer, Starbucks is tightening its belt.
3420	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better- tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving some consumers with less discretionary income.
3422	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to reflect the tough economy."
3423	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said second quarter profit fell 28 percent, to $108.7 million, from $150.8 million a year earlier, while per-share earnings declined 21 percent, to 15 cents, from 19 cents.
3424	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The results included reorganization costs of about 3 cents a share.
3425	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company said revenue rose 12 percent, to $2.5 billion.
3426	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report came just a week after Starbucks warned of lower-than- expected earnings and cut its full-year forecast, citing a decline in quarterly sales and describing the economic environment as the weakest in the company's history.
3427	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Wall Street analysts had forecast 19 cents a share for the quarter.
3429	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
3430	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
3431	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbuck's shares.
3432	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The stock, which fell 11 percent after the company's warning last week, rose 3 cents, to $16.23 a share, in regular trading.
3434	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
3435	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue.
3436	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.
3437	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
3438	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"There are no sacred cows."
3439	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020 stores this year, down from its previous target of 1,175, and to open fewer than 400 stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
3440	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
3441	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
3442	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to $800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011.
3443	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
3444	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.
3445	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service.
3446	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company also announced three new cold beverages.
3447	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures.
3448	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	The company expects revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent this year.
3449	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.

3460	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"Independence offers the only guarantee against the risk" of instability, he said.
3461	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"It's also the only chance for a sustainable partnership with Serbia."
3462	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Under the plan, Kosovo would have its own constitution but would "for an initial phase" be placed under the international monitoring of "civilian personnel" named by the European Union.
3463	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	NATO forces would continue to be present at the outset and the Serb minority would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, according to the report quoted by Le Monde.
3464	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombing helped to drive out Serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
3465	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Some 10,000 ethnic Albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict.
3467	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Members of the UN Security Council are to receive the full final report from Ahtisaari on Monday.

3488	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	The spokesman of Wingate Institute told Xinhua that eight nations will compete in the four-day tournament, including European champion Serbia and Russia, which won the bronze medal at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
3490	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	All of the teams apart from the Israelis have competed in the Olympics.
3492	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	"Our biggest competition is Russia, within the teams that we are playing," Seker said.
3494	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	"It will be great exposure for the public to water polo," Seker said.
3496	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	The tournament is being held under the auspices of FINA, the organization which runs international water polo.
3497	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	It starts at 9 a.m. on Thursday with Greece facing France, with an opening ceremony at 6:30 p.m.

3503	XIN_ENG_20080121.0327.LDC2009T13	Although water polo is included in the Maccabiah Games, held in Israel every four years, a competition of this calibre has never been held in this country before.
3504	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	ON THE MONEY
3505	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were here to promote "The Counterfeiters."
3506	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Ruzowitzky wrote and directed and Markovics stars in the based-on-fact drama about a massive Nazi-run counterfeiting operation during World War II that used concentration camp prisoners.
3507	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	.
3508	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But their excitement was already evident about the possibility of winning this year's best foreign language picture Oscar - which, in fact, "The Counterfeiters" did.
3509	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics and Ruzowitzky spoke of the award with mounting animation - though not enough to mar their fluent, moderately accented, English.
3510	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's a category of its own, the Oscar," Markovics said when asked if the award had much meaning a continent away.
3511	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an event."
3512	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are back home," Ruzowitzky said.
3514	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
3515	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism, or its absence, is a central concern in "The Counterfeiters."
3516	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him.
3517	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's a crook, a survivor - but also a master of his trade and a man who does his best to protect his fellow workers.
3518	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But by doing so, he's helping the Nazi war effort.
3520	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Is Sally a hero?
3521	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
3522	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Neither?
3523	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"No, he's not a hero," Markovics said.
3524	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I don't believe in heroes - and he doesn't either.
3525	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are no heroes under these conditions.
3526	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There's only surviving to the next day and being able to face yourself in the mirror."
3527	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Heroism isn't the point, Ruzowitzky said of Sally.
3528	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"He himself believes he has no ideals or principles.
3529	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Then we find out he does have ideals.
3530	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good citizen.
3531	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But he definitely has them."
3532	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.
3533	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The printers take pride in their work because they are, in their way, artists, too.
3534	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A counterfeiter is not unlike an actor or filmmaker.
3535	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Each earns his income creating a version of reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
3536	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That affinity between counterfeiter and creator is "one of the reasons this character felt so familiar to me," Markovics said of Sally.
3537	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"When I read the script, I almost felt as if I knew him."
3538	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he appears in "The Counterfeiters."
3539	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Bearded and amiable, he could be a professor playing hooky from MIT, a few blocks away from the Hotel Marlowe, where the interview took place.
3540	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Of course I look different," he said with a smile.
3541	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I was supposed to be in a concentration camp."
3542	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The difference is more than just a matter of having put on a few pounds.
3543	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
3544	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I always have fun playing characters not really hiding but giving the impression there's much more under the surface," Markovics said.
3545	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"This always attracts me more than showing everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing.
3546	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	This character especially gave me a chance to do this."
3547	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The source of the movie is a memoir by Adolf Burger.
3548	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger, who's now 90 and attended the Oscars, was imprisoned for his radical political views.
3549	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He tried to sabotage the forgeries, risking the lives of himself and his fellow counterfeiters.
3550	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger is played in the movie by August Diehl.
3551	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
3552	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In a camp, you can't do the right thing or the wrong thing.
3553	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	All these different perspectives are understandable.
3554	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Writing the script, I was a bit afraid that my audience would love Burger because he's so heroic and has the right ideals and is the one who stands up against the Nazis.
3555	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So actually we shot some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow.
3556	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Why?
3557	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Because in real life we can identify with his approach, which is, yeah, I'm just trying to get along, not change the world, be a human."
3558	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	World War II seems very much a thing of the past to his generation, said Ruzowitzky, who's 46.
3559	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"It's the Holocaust, rather than the war, that I think about.
3560	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That's a real difference.
3562	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For us, I don't know any battles.
3563	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Talking about the Second World War is talking about the Nazis, talking about the Holocaust."
3564	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
3565	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The one hard and fast rule he had while filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's point of view.
3566	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
3567	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"So our master shot, which is usually in old-school filmmaking a wide shot from an objective point of view, was always following Sally - over his shoulder.
3568	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	We never, ever did a shot over-shoulder of one of the Nazis.
3569	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Burger says in the movie, 'I'd never be in the place of an SS criminal.'
3570	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	My ((director of photography)) and I felt this should be true for us as well."
3571	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The Counterfeiters" makes clear the Nazis' evil, but that doesn't mean it fails to acknowledge the various moral complexities arising from the title characters' situation.
3572	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are ways in which the World War II film it most resembles isn't one about the Holocaust but "The Bridge on the River Kwai."
3574	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"That aspect is there," Ruzowitzky agreed.
3575	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"If you meet Mr. Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone: whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
3576	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	But as soon as he starts discussing these works of art they were producing there, and how well they worked, and even the Bank of England thought they were right, his eyes light up!
3577	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	He's so proud, because he's a printer, and this was quite an achievement for them."
3578	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The response to "The Counterfeiters" (it's been sold to more than 60 countries) speaks to a greater interest in German-language films generally, Ruzowitzky said.
3579	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The success of movies like 'Lives of Others' and 'Downfall' ((the 2004 release in which Bruno Ganz played Hitler)) has helped us a lot.
3581	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Entertaining may be the wrong word for a concentration camp movie, but it is accessible.
3582	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	You're not tortured if you go watch this movie.
3583	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	I think German-language movies are quite successful these days."
3584	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign- language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for "The Counterfeiters."
3585	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's not just the films themselves that have won, though.
3586	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?'
3587	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's her Oscar as well."

3589	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev says Anheuser Busch takeover is finalized
3591	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev SA formed the world's largest brewer Tuesday when it completed its $52 billion (euro41 billion) takeover of Anheuser- Busch Cos.
3592	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Inc.
3593	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company, named Anheuser-Busch InBev, will be headed by InBev CEO Carlos Brito and will be headquartered at Leuven, Belgium.
3595	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch President and CEO August A. Busch IV joins the new company's board as a non-executive director.
3596	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch shares stopped trading Monday and will now be swapped for $70 each in cash.
3597	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The Belgian-Brazilian takeover of Anheuser-Busch comes after a bitter battle turned sweeter with a higher offer in July, despite protests in St. Louis that saw politicians criticize the deal and Web sites call for Bud to be saved from "the waffle guys."
3600	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch already plans to shed 1,185 jobs -- mostly by offering early retirement and not filling vacancies.
3602	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Grupo Modelo filed a notice of arbitration against Anheuser-Busch last month, saying the takeover violated their investment agreement and its right of consent to enter into a partnership with InBev.
3603	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Taking over Anheuser-Busch gives InBev a jewel of a brand in Budweiser -- the world's top selling beer -- which it promises to sell more widely by pushing into emerging economies in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe.
3604	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It will sell a fifth of all beer in both Russia and China.
3605	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	This will help generate growth as beer sales decline in North America and Europe where drinkers are cutting back and turning to wine and other drinks.
3606	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company leapfrogs SABMiller as top brewer and becomes one of the world's top five consumer goods companies.
3607	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Brito said the combination had created "a stronger, more competitive global company with a leading international brand portfolio and distribution network, and great potential for growth all over the world."
3608	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev said it now had all the regulatory clearances it needed for the deal.
3610	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It said it was necessary to prevent Anheuser-Busch InBev becoming a monopoly in the country.
3611	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	This curbs future growth in the world's most populous nation.
3612	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It caps Anheuser-Busch's 27-percent stake in Tsingtao Beer Ltd. and InBev's 28.5 percent holding in Zhujiang Beer Ltd.
3615	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It will hold on to Labatt in Canada.
3617	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	U.S. antitrust officials had worried that beer prices would increase in upstate New York because -- with Budweiser and Labatt Blue -- the two companies would supply most of the beer in the region.
3618	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev has borrowed $45 billion to pay for the deal and secured $9.8 billion in equity bridge financing that it had planned to replace with a share issue in October.
3619	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	But rocky financial markets forced it to postpone issuing new shares and it says it can keep the bridge financing in place for up to six months after it closes the deal and issue shares early next year.
3620	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev says the company is well positioned to cope with a slowing global economy because costs for key ingredients such as grain malt for brewing beer and aluminum for beer cans will fall even as sales stall.
3622	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Beer industry analysts Plato Logic says beer sales will slow significantly to expand just 3 percent next year as economies around the world shrink or stagnate.

3624	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Belgium 2007-01-29 11:33:11 UTC
3625	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The European Commission on Monday called for a temporary cut in EU sugar production to avoid surplus sugar stocks.
3626	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The 27 EU nations should cut their sugar production by 2 million tons, or 12 percent, for the 2007-08 production year, EU Farm Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said.
3627	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Part of the quota for that period will either have to counted toward the quota for the following year, or be sold for industrial use, such as bioethanol.
3628	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU governments will study the proposal and decide on a new production ceiling in October, the Commission said in a statement.
3629	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU reformed its sugar subsidy program in 2005, ending the dumping of cheap sugar on the world market.
3630	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The reform has caused job cuts at refineries and forced many farmers out of growing sugar beet and sugar cane.
3631	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Under the old system, production was supported by generous EU subsidies and import tariffs that guaranteed and inflated price for sugar.
3632	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	That will now be phased out.
3633	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU sugar prices are more than three times higher than the global market rate.
3634	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU also pays out export subsidies to get millions of tons of sugar off its market every year.

3655	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	China's education officials are joining with employment authorities to mount investigations into reports of agencies and individuals who lure minors to work, said the Ministry of Education on Thursday.
3656	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	"We have received reports that some agencies and individuals lured minors to work on the pretense of introducing them to part- time jobs or internships," said the ministry in a circular.
3657	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Education authorities across the country will join with officials who have law enforcement powers in labor departments and commerce and industry administrations to intensify supervision and management to stop illegal employment of minors by agencies and individuals, it said.
3658	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	The ministry asked its local branches and all schools to be aware and report illegal employment to the authorities.
3660	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Employers who violate the law can be fined and, if the crime is serious, their business licenses will be withdrawn.
3661	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	In June, private brick kilns in north China's Shanxi Province were found abusing workers, many of whom were underage, in a forced labor scandal.
3662	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	A total of 95 officials in the province have been punished in the wake of the forced labor scandal.
3663	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	The ministry also warned vocational schools not to violate regulations on internships, which ban students from interning during their first year.
3664	XIN_ENG_20071018.0247.LDC2009T13	Most vocational schools in China take in students who finish three years in secondary school, but do not go to high school.

3669	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	A dozen or more people were wounded in the melee when gunfire erupted as demonstrators were throwing rocks and fireworks at a phalanx of troops.
3671	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence came two days after a massive car bomb killed one of the country's top intelligence officials and 12 days after another explosion struck a U.S. Embassy convoy, killing three civilians.
3673	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"In these moments, our country is passing through its most difficult and dangerous times," he said.
3674	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The violence was the latest sign of deteriorating security in a country that has been paralyzed by a political standoff between two camps, one favoring the West and the other backed by Iran and Syria, over the formation of a new government.
3675	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The fighting erupted near the southern Beirut neighborhood of Ain al-Roumaneh, site of a 1975 massacre of Palestinians that helped spark a 15-year civil war in Lebanon.
3678	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of demonstrators, some wearing ski masks, gathered in the streets of the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya to protest power cuts.
3679	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	They said the disruption had left them with about six hours of electricity a day, compared with 21 hours for parts of central Beirut.
3680	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Shouting slogans and hurling epithets against Siniora's U.S.-backed government, they raced around the streets on motor scooters, set tires ablaze and tried to block roads, including the route to the airport.
3682	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	"We have jobs and work to do, and without electricity we can't do anything."
3683	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	An official of the Amal Party, a Shiite political group, was killed in an unexplained volley of gunfire.
3684	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	The angry crowds swelled.
3685	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	They tossed tires and explosives into a bonfire, set cars on fire and showered security forces with rocks.
3686	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Gunfire again erupted.
3687	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	One victim in his late teens fell to the ground, choking as he lay in a pool of blood.
3688	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Ambulances waiting at the scene rushed to take him and other wounded people to a nearby hospital.
3689	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	It remained unclear whether the victims were struck by gunfire from troops.
3690	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	In a statement, the army said it was launching an investigation to determine the identity of the shooters.
3691	LTW_ENG_20080128.0035.LDC2009T13	Many of the demonstrators said they were loyal to Amal, one of the groups in the camp led by the Shiite militia Hezbollah and backed by Iran and Syria.

3713	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	RICHARDSON COVETS ROLE OF CLOSER ON BIG DEALS MICHAEL HAEDERLE CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM ALBUQUERQUE.
3714	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	SANTA FE, N.M.
3715	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico has a reputation for doing whatever it takes to cajole companies to invest here in his home state, from giving movie producers his private phone number to building a special water-treatment plant for a cheese company.
3716	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	A darling of business leaders, Richardson likes to get involved in the fine details of each project, often using his considerable powers of persuasion to seal deals with investors with a handshake.
3718	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We would set it up and he would close it."
3720	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The governor has created a thriving film industry here from scratch and has nurtured a fledgling solar-energy sector, mostly through tax breaks for investors.
3721	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He has also persuaded several light manufacturers to set up shop, attracted investments from high-tech companies, built a commuter railroad and transformed a sleepy border crossing into a transportation hub to increase trade with Mexico.
3722	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	In perhaps his biggest gamble, Richardson has procured financing for a spaceport in southern New Mexico, called Spaceport America, from which he envisions tourists departing on cruises beyond the atmosphere.
3724	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's not one to spend a lot of time on small projects."
3725	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	It remains to be seen whether Richardson can do something similar on the national level.
3726	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he wants his commerce secretary to play a pivotal role in salvaging the economy, and aides to Richardson say they expect that he will try to expand the traditional role of the office.
3727	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to elevate this office to a level of importance that it genuinely deserves during this economic crisis," said Homans, who is the state tax commissioner.
3728	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He's going to be, in some respects, reinventing the Department of Commerce."
3729	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Richardson said at a news conference here on Thursday that he would apply to the national economy some of the same principles he used to create jobs in New Mexico.
3730	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Obviously," he said, "we need to rebuild America's economy, domestically and internationally, create jobs and get ourselves out of this stagnant situation."
3731	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But economists and political opponents point out that Richardson has benefited from record-high oil and natural gas prices during his tenure as governor.
3732	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	As a result, state coffers were overflowing with revenue from taxes on oil and gas production.
3733	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	The surpluses allowed Richardson to cut the personal income tax nearly in half his first year in office and still give tax breaks to manufacturers and offer filmmakers a 25-cent tax rebate for every dollar they spent on a production in New Mexico.
3735	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Economists say that job growth, too, owed a lot to the boom in the oil and natural gas fields.
3736	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	With the price of oil plummeting, the growth in jobs has leveled off here and a projected $500 million shortfall has opened up in the state budget.
3737	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Still, no one doubts the state would be worse off in the current recession had it not been for Richardson's success in attracting investment and creating jobs.
3738	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Business leaders whom Richardson has wooed say he is a tough negotiator, hard to resist one on one.
3740	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It was the only time I've ever been given a presidential candidate's cell phone number by a presidential candidate," Fine said.
3742	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	After they went over the fine points of the agreement, Richardson, a physically imposing man, suddenly stood and reached a big hand over the table and asked, "Do we have a deal?"
3743	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Ungeheuer was taken aback, but a few seconds later shook on it, according to people who were present.
3744	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"The way the deal was sealed was with a handshake, and he made sure he got that handshake before he left the room," said Fine, still sounding somewhat incredulous.
3745	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"We built a plant in New Mexico on the basis of a handshake."
3746	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Some of Richardson's detractors, however, say he can be overbearing and vicious when he does not get his way.
3747	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	He enjoys the limelight that comes from his visionary pronouncements, they say, and he is impatient with opponents.
3748	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"It's his way or the highway," said the state Senate president pro tempore, Timothy Z. Jennings, a Democrat who has clashed with the governor over spending.
3749	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"Anyone who dares to differ with him, he doesn't take very well."
3750	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the growth of the film industry in New Mexico attests to Richardson's skills as a salesman and deal-closer.
3751	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Shortly after taking office in 2003, the governor went to Hollywood to meet with the heads of major studios.
3752	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"To a person, their mouths were agape, as if to say, 'Is this guy really here?"'
3753	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	recalled Eric Witt, a deputy chief of staff.
3754	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	But Richardson has lured producers, one by one, from large Hollywood studios to New Mexico with tax abatements and personal pressure.
3756	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, more than 115 feature films and television series have been made here, among them the Oscar-winning "No Country for Old Men."
3758	NYT_ENG_20081208.0140.LDC2009T13	"He did it methodically, slowly, understanding the beast."

3761	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton continued the battle to win the Democratic presidential nomination, with record turnouts in the North Carolina and Indiana primaries Tuesday.
3762	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Voters lined up before sunrise in the capital of the midwestern state of Indiana, where the first polling stations opened at 6:00 am (1100 GMT) under overcast skies.
3763	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	The day's voting closes in North Carolina at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT), with a combined total of 187 pledged delegates on offer in the two states.
3764	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Pre-election polls showed Obama leading in North Carolina while Clinton appeared to have the edge in Indiana.
3765	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Judging by numbers, Obama is the Democratic front-runner so far, as he leads in pledged delegates and is also ahead in the popular vote.
3766	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	However, he has also been unable to force Clinton out of the race.
3767	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	If Obama can take both states, he will strengthen his advantage over Clinton and influence the superdelegates who will ultimately decide who will represent the Democratic Party in November's presidential election.
3768	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Clinton needs to at least take Indiana to stay in the race.
3770	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	A rolling average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com gives Obama 1,491 pledged delegates from all the races so far to Clinton's 1,337.
3771	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	Neither can reach the winning line of 2,025 without backing from the superdelegates -- party officials free to vote either way.
3772	XIN_ENG_20080506.0239.LDC2009T13	North Carolina and Indiana will also hold Republican presidential primaries Tuesday.
3778	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"If Americans are to be placed in harm's way, all of us, from every income group and position in society, must share the burden of war," Rangel said.
3779	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of our troops fighting in Iraq are young men and women who have chosen to enlist because military service is an economic opportunity," Rangel said.
3780	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"They are motivated by enlistment bonuses up to 40,000 dollars and additional thousands in scholarships to attend college.
3782	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	"It is time that all Americans -- including the wealthy -- be given the opportunity to prove their patriotism as well, by saluting when the flag goes up and defending their country in wartime.
3783	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	A military draft would ensure that."
3784	AFP_ENG_20070111.0683.LDC2009T13	Rangel first proposed legislation for the draft in January 2003 before the invasion of Iraq two months later, but it was voted down.

3796	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari arrived Saturday for his second visit since the junta violently suppressed anti-government demonstrations in September.
3797	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The day before his arrival in Yangon, the isolated Southeast Asian nation's largest city, the junta announced it planned to expel the top U.N. diplomat in the country, adding an extra hurdle to the envoy's already difficult mission.
3801	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The military has said 10 people were killed in the crackdown, but diplomats and dissidents say the death toll is much higher.
3802	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Thousands of people were detained.
3803	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta gave foreign diplomats and U.N. representatives a note saying the government did not intend to continue Petrie's assignment in the country.
3804	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.N. said in a statement that Gambari met with Petrie after his arrival and would "stay in Myanmar as long as necessary to accomplish his mission."
3806	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari was earlier dispatched to Myanmar after the government crackdown, meeting with Than Shwe as well as twice with Suu Kyi.
3807	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	But little of substance has changed on Myanmar's political scene since, and analysts expect that little will result from Gambari's current visit.
3808	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	"It's a game.
3809	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	It's the only game in town, but it's a game," said David Steinberg, a Myanmar expert from Georgetown University who visited the country last month and met with ministerial-level officials.
3810	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The United Nations has attempted to bring about reconciliation for almost two decades.
3811	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The junta has from time to time made minor concessions, such as brief meetings with Suu Kyi, but continues to perpetuate its 45-year stranglehold on power -- and sometimes snub its nose at the international community.
3812	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Protest leaders who recently escaped to Thailand say some still look on the United Nations with hope, but others are deeply disillusioned that it has failed to be more forceful in dealing with the generals.
3813	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	"The world seems to have accepted the lies of the (junta).
3817	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	Gambari has been on a six-nation Asian tour urging support from key countries for national reconciliation, a stepped-up transition to democracy, and the release of all detained demonstrators.
3818	APW_ENG_20071104.0155.LDC2009T13	The U.S. and other Western countries shun the junta for its poor human rights record and failure to hand over power to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi's party after it won national elections in 1990.

3824	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Addressing the press on Monday, North Eastern Provincial Medical Officer of Health Ahmed Omar said that one death has occurred at Sangailu dispensary while patients from Bilbil in Tana River District in Coast Province succumbed to the disease at the Garissa Provincial General Hospital last night.
3825	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	He said teams of 10 doctors were dispatched Monday morning to support other doctors on the ground to prevent the killer disease from spreading further.
3826	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Three of the four new cases are recorded in Ijara while the other is from Garissa District.
3827	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Omar said that due to the vastness of the province, it was difficult to tell whether the disease was under control adding that he was waiting for reports from doctors on the ground tomorrow.
3828	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	He decried the impassability of roads in the region and the nomadic lifestyle of the local community adding that the twin problems have hampered government effort to control disease once and for all.
3829	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Rift Valley Fever is endemic in Africa, naturally occurring in livestock but occasionally affecting humans.
3830	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Animals are infected with the virus by the Aedes mosquito.
3831	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The disease, characterized by bleeding from all orifices, is spread to humans in a number of ways: from infected mosquitoes

3833	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	or from the organs of infected animals.
3834	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	Symptoms of the disease include fever, general weakness and malaise, cough and diarrhoea, with severe cases progressing to show facial swelling and bleeding from the orifices.
3835	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) of Rift Valley Fever varies from two to six days.
3836	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	The fever mainly occurs following periods of heavy rainfall.
3837	XIN_ENG_20070101.0059.LDC2009T13	In 1998, an outbreak claimed at least 200 lives in the North Eastern Province following the El Nino rains.
3839	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	RATE HIKE LOOMS FOR MANY TEXAS ALLSTATE POLICYHOLDERS
3840	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
3841	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Allstate Texas Lloyds is raising home insurance rates 5.9 percent statewide, the company said Monday.
3842	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Coastal residents in counties once and twice removed from the Gulf of Mexico, such as Harris and Montgomery counties, will also see an additional average 2 percent rate hike.
3843	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	That's to help cover the cost of reinsurance, or insurance the company buys for itself to help pay for claims in the event of a catastrophe, the company said.
3844	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Residents of Galveston County and a sliver of Harris County will not be hit with the average 2 percent increase because the company dropped windstorm coverage in counties that touch coastal waters last year.
3845	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The rates will change on policies as they come up for renewal, Allstate said.
3846	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rising construction costs also contributed to the rate hike, the company said.
3847	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	About 700,000 of Allstate's 917,000 Texas policyholders are insured by Allstate Texas Lloyds.
3848	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, Allstate withdrew a proposed 6.9 percent statewide increase in homeowners rates after the Texas Department of Insurance signaled that it wouldn't approve rates.
3850	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	The range of rates coastal residents will pay was not available, he said.
3851	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies in Texas are allowed to implement their rate increases upon filing them with regulators without prior approval.
3852	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	However, regulators can disapprove the rates after they've been implemented and order refunds.
3853	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Rod Bordelon, of the Texas Office of Public Insurance Counsel that represents consumers, said he anticipates the office will oppose the rates.
3854	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"I see no basis for any such increase," said Bordelon, the public counsel.
3855	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	"We're still looking at it."
3857	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	He said that if Bordelon opposes the increase "that opinion has a great deal of weight to it."
3859	NYT_ENG_20070820.0234.LDC2009T13	Farmers which also withdrew proposed rate increases last month in anticipation of opposition from the state has yet to file a new proposal, a spokeswoman said.

3864	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola took the helm on Wednesday of the oil cartel OPEC at a time when plunging crude prices are casting a shadow over the previously glowing prospects of Africa's fastest growing economy.
3865	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	The resurgence of the southern African nation, which was devastated by a 27-year civil war, has been almost entirely dependent on its oil output which accounts for a staggering 90 percent of revenue.
3866	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola is OPEC's newest member, only joining in 2007, and sees its year-long presidency as a chance to forge a new image for a country more usually associated with conflict.
3868	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Angola has overtaken Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producer, pumping around two million barrels per day, and is now the biggest supplier to China.
3869	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Months of high oil prices, which hit a peak of 147 dollars a barrel in July, led the ruling party to announce ambitious spending plans ahead of parliamentary elections in September such as building one million new homes.
3870	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	But with price having now slumped to around 45 dollars a barrel, the government has had to revise its 2008 growth forecast from 20 percent to 16 percent and begin to eat into its reserves.
3872	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Should there be the need for a revision of the state budget due to the drop of the oil price in the world market that will be done next year," Junior said in parliament.
3873	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	This spending plan is essential for the reconstruction of a nation decimated by the civil war which ended in 2002, with 70 percent of the population still living on less than two dollars a day, according to the World Bank.
3876	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Many members of OPEC need oil to go up because they have calculated their budgets based on high oil prices," he told AFP.
3877	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"For instance Angola has promised to build one million houses and they have to find the revenues from somewhere to do that.
3878	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	And you see the same things happening in Nigeria and Venezuela for example."
3882	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Angola is a player -- and it's a player because of oil.
3883	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	Today if you talk about Angola, you talk about oil," he said.
3884	AFP_ENG_20081217.0448.LDC2009T13	"Now with the presidency of OPEC, they are going to have more visibility and I hope that this mandate goes well to guarantee a positive image for the governance of Angola."

4029	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We need to study if people should get access to handguns so freely," Vanhanen told reporters in Kauhajoki, 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Helsinki.
4030	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"I'm very, very critical about the guns and during next few months we will make a decision about it."
4031	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Finland has deeply held hunting traditions and ranks -- along with the United States -- in the top five nations in the world when it comes to civilian gun ownership.
4032	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The government also called Wednesday for an investigation into police handling of the case.
4033	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Police had questioned shooter Matti Saari, a student at the school, a day before the attack about YouTube clips showing him firing a handgun.
4034	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"We will obviously investigate what the foundation was for the decision to let him keep his weapon," Vanhanen said.
4035	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	An anonymous tip Friday led police to search for Saari, but they released him after questioning Monday because police said they found no reason to keep him in custody.
4036	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Some of the YouTube clips appeared to have been shot by another person and police said they would question Saari's acquaintances to find out who that was.
4037	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	However, police said there was no indication that Saari had an accomplice during the shooting.
4038	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Solemnly leading his nation in a day of mourning, Vanhanen and other ministers visited Kauhajoki, a town of 14,000 people, as flags flew at half-staff.
4039	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Grieving residents placed candles and flowers outside the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality.
4040	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The National Bureau of Investigation said all the female victims were students, while the two men who were killed were a teacher and a student.
4041	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Saari also shot another female student in the head before shooting himself in the head.
4042	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	That 21-year-old woman had two operations overnight but doctors said she was in satisfactory condition Wednesday.
4043	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Investigators said most of the victims were from the Kauhajoki area, like Saari, meaning he probably knew them.
4045	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"He left at home a message saying he wanted to murder as many people as possible.
4046	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	He tried to shoot fatal shots."
4048	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	"With this weapon and plenty of ammunition, he came into the school yesterday morning and he also had a largish bag which apparently had flammable liquids or something to start fires," Lintula said.
4049	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said panic erupted at the school, which offers courses in catering, tourism, nursing and home economics, as the masked gunman entered just before 11 a.m. and started firing in a classroom where students were taking an exam.
4050	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	A video clip posted on the Internet by the alleged gunman showed him pointing his gun to the camera and saying "You will die next" before firing four rounds.
4051	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	The rampage bore eerie similarities to another school massacre in Finland last year in which an 18-year-old gunman killed eight people and himself.
4052	APW_ENG_20080924.0608.LDC2009T13	After that massacre, the government promised to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 15 to 18, but legislation was never passed.

4058	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	China and Australia upgraded their security ties Thursday, announcing annual talks on international issues and overseeing a new energy trade deal that underscores their flourishing economic relations.
4060	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	The two also discussed climate change -- the core issue at a weekend summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
4064	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	China agreed to donate two pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australia.
4065	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard, in remarks to a conference of business executives, noted that Australia was in its 16th straight year of economic expansion and credited China's explosive emergence as contributing to it.
4066	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	"China's growth is undeniably good for the world.
4067	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	It has been undeniably good for Australia," Howard said.
4068	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Taking the podium after him, Hu echoed Howard, saying, "China's sound and steady economic growth has not only benefited China's 1.3 billion people, but also offered enormous business opportunities to other countries."
4069	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu's visit was not friction-free.
4071	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	On climate change, Howard is seeking a strong endorsement for a new approach to global warming from the leaders at the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
4072	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Hu, however, only reiterated China's stock position -- that while global warming is a problem, it is largely the fault and responsibility of already industrialized nations.
4073	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	In an indirect slap at Howard's agenda for APEC, Hu said he hoped that the summit's declaration would note that U.N.-sponsored talks "should remain the main channel" for the international efforts to tackle climate change.
4074	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	While the new security talks between Australia and China, which will be convened by foreign ministers next year, marks an upgrade in ties, its announcement comes as Australia also upgrades its security ties with Pacific allies the United States and Japan, who are traditional or potential rivals with China.
4077	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Asked by reporters if the Australia-U.S.-Japan dialogue represented a threat to China, Hu said the countries involved were better able to explain their intentions.
4078	APW_ENG_20070906.0497.LDC2009T13	Howard said the three-way talks were not directed at China, whose rapid military buildup has been a source of concern in Washington and other regional capitals.

4715	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are hip-hop Masses, Native American rituals to install a new presiding bishop and legions of gay and straight priests who don the rainbow stoles of gay liberation.
4716	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Its pews are full of Roman Catholics and Christians from other traditions attracted by its aura of radical acceptance.
4719	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.
4721	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance.
4724	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"But if the price of that is I have to turn my back on the gay and lesbian people who are part of this church and part of me, I won't do that."
4726	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Many in her church had been eager to hear her explain why she signed onto the communique, when she, as much as anyone, is clearly a product of the church's inclusive rainbow culture.
4727	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In her former diocese in Nevada, she allowed the blessing of same- sex unions and consented to the election of V. Gene Robinson, an openly gay man, as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003.
4730	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	She suggested that the struggle for equality for gay men and lesbians would eventually prevail, just as the slaves in Africa were eventually freed -- an occasion she and the other primates commemorated last Sunday at a ceremony at the Cathedral in Zanzibar, the site of a former slave-trading market.
4731	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori concluded by noting that Lent is about to begin, and said that both sides in this conflict are being asked to undergo a "season of fasting
4733	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Conservatives in the church were also wary about the communique's plan, but generally far more upbeat than the liberals.
4736	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
4738	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The General Convention, however, does not meet this year and is not scheduled for another meeting until 2009.
4739	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique calls for the House of Bishops to "make an unequivocal common covenant that the bishops will not authorize any Rite of Blessing for same-sex unions."
4740	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Some liberals on Tuesday were latching onto what they saw as a loophole because the wording specifies that the bishops will not authorize rites.
4741	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are many bishops who have not formally authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless allow priests to perform them.
4743	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"Blessings happen, sure," said Sisk.
4744	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"But I didn't authorize them."
4745	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	MacPherson, however, said that his understanding is that the communique asks the bishops to actually stop the performing of same-sex blessings in their dioceses.
4746	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The most despairing reactions came from gay men and lesbians in the church, who say this is not reconciliation, but capitulation.
4747	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to make people choose between the Communion and the church's commitment to gay and lesbian people," said the Rev.

5031	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida 2007-08-21 17:10:33 UTC
5032	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-week orbital drama that centered on a deep gouge in the shuttle's belly and an early homecoming prompted by a hurricane.
5033	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The space shuttle swooped out of the partly cloudy sky and touched down on the runway at 12:32 p.m. (1632 GMT).
5034	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	"Congratulations.
5035	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Welcome home.
5036	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	You've given a new meaning to higher education," Mission Control told commander Scott Kelly and his crew, which included teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan.
5037	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The main concern for much of the mission was the gouge to Endeavour's protective tiles.
5038	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA did not want the shuttle to suffer any structural damage that, while not catastrophic, might require lengthy postflight repairs.
5039	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Over the past few days and right up until landing, NASA had stressed that the 3 1/2-inch-long 3.5 (8.9-centimeter-long) gouge in Endeavour's belly would not endanger the shuttle during its landing.
5040	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	In 2003, a damaged wing on shuttle Columbia had allowed hot gases to seep in during the re-entry, tearing the shuttle apart.
5041	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	There was zero chance of a Columbia-style catastrophe this time, NASA managers insisted, although they acknowledged re-entry was always risky.
5042	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damaged area on Endeavour was subjected to high temperatures during the hottest part of atmospheric re-entry, but engineers were convinced after a week of thermal analyses and tests that the spacecraft would hold up.
5043	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	With its pilots reporting no problems, Endeavour zoomed over the South Pacific, crossed Central America and Cuba, then headed up the Florida peninsula into Kennedy Space Center.
5044	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Its trip spanned 13 days and 5.3 million miles (8.53 million kilometers).
5045	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The shuttle was not supposed to return until Wednesday, but over the weekend, mission managers decided to cut its space station visit short because of Hurricane Dean.
5046	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	At the time, NASA was uncertain if Dean would veer toward Texas and threaten Houston, home to Mission Control.
5047	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Even though forecasters later put Houston out of harm's way, NASA held to a Tuesday landing.
5048	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	During Endeavour's liftoff on Aug. 8, a piece of foam insulation or ice had broken off a bracket on the external fuel tank, fell onto a strut lower on the tank and then bounced into the shuttle, gashing its tiles.
5049	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The astronauts inspected the especially vulnerable areas Sunday, after undocking from the international space station.
5050	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA on Monday cleared Endeavour for landing after engineers finished evaluating the latest laser images of the shuttle's wings and nose and concluded there were no holes or cracks from micrometeorites or space junk.
5051	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	Brackets have shed debris in launches since Columbia, but it was not until Endeavour's flight that such debris caused noticeable damage again.
5052	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	The damage triggered a weeklong analyses that involved hundreds of engineers and thousands of hours of supercomputer simulations.
5053	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	NASA does not plan to launch another space shuttle until the problem is solved.
5054	APW_ENG_20070821.1000.LDC2009T13	For now, Discovery is supposed to lift off in late October.

5075	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Vets were urgently carrying out tests to confirm whether the horse at Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse was infected, but the initial outcome appeared to realise the racing industry's worst fears, officials said.
5077	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The previous tests have been accurate so we are holding little hope.
5078	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The test on the second sample will be expedited and we should know for certain later," he said.
5079	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It is such bad news."
5080	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Trainer Anthony Cummings said the suspect horse had an elevated temperature but he was hoping tests would still clear the animal of infection.
5082	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"The symptoms are not present in him or the horses around him but we will wait and see."
5083	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The unprecedented outbreak of equine flu in Australia was first detected among recreational and pleasure horses a week ago, forcing a halt to all movements of horses across the country and a cancellation of all race meetings.
5084	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	The outbreak has left the multi-billion dollar racing industry reeling and wiped millions in turnover from the major betting firms.
5085	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	But racing was expected to resume this weekend in all states apart from Queensland and New South Wales, where officials had hoped they could restart races in a limited form in the next couple of weeks.
5086	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	If the positive result for horse flu in a thoroughbred is confirmed, the racing calendar in New South Wales is likely to remain blank for some time, with experts predicting Randwick will be locked down for at least a month
5088	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"It would then place the place under total quarantine, and there wouldn't be any possibility for racing for quite some time," McDonald told ABC radio.
5089	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	Some 700 thoroughbreds are stabled at Randwick and trainer John O'Shea said the racing community was despondent about the prospect of a horse flu outbreak.
5090	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"Once one horse is diagnosed, we all know there is just a matter of time before all our horses are infected with the same disease," he said.
5091	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"My staff, myself and my owners, we live for the spring carnival.
5092	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	It's the two or three months of the year where that's what's it's about, being involved in the racing industry.
5093	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	"That's now been taken away from us and it's horribly unlikely that we'll be back racing in the next two to three months."
5094	AFP_ENG_20070830.0647.LDC2009T13	There have even been reports that race organisers could saddle up camels or hold phantom meetings without spectators in a bid to satisfy punters unable to place a bet because of the ban.

5171	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	European aviation giant Airbus on Tuesday announced more delays to the delivery of its giant A380 superjumbos, saying the current schedule was not one it could meet.
5172	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be able to deliver 12 of the aircraft in 2008 instead of the 13 previously announced, and 21 in 2009 instead of the 25 it had earlier said it could manage, a statement said.
5173	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A review that led to the revised schedule did not cover financial costs, said the statement from parent company and aerospace giant EADS.
5174	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"The extent of the additional costs will be influenced by the actual production and delivery scenario," it said.
5175	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The company would be discussing the new schedule with its customers in the coming months, the statement added.
5177	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"Beyond these aircraft, the changes in production schedules will potentially have some impact, the details of which we will need to understand from Airbus," an SIA spokesman said.
5178	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA has ordered 19 A380 aircraft in all and took delivery of the first in October, some 18 months late after earlier technical problems held up production and led to a dramatic restructuring and cost-cutting programme at Airbus.
5179	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	"We have seen the announcement from Airbus and are now waiting to hear from them in detail about what the changes to their production schedule mean for deliveries of our aircraft down the line," SIA said.
5180	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	SIA launched the first commercial A380 flight from Singapore to Sydney in October, followed by services to London.
5181	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	A380 flights to Tokyo are to begin on May 20.
5182	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The double-decker plane can carry 853 people.
5184	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	EADS shares fell sharply in the wake of that story.
5185	AFP_ENG_20080513.0583.LDC2009T13	The report said quality problems on components, and airline interior design requirements -- which make production more complex -- were causing difficulties.
5186	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama momentum mounts in Democratic White House race
5187	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Barack Obama's White House drive picked up pace Friday with more superdelegates rallying to his side, including the head of a leading union, as former rival John Edwards all but endorsed his campaign.
5188	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Since Obama's convincing win in North Carolina on Tuesday over rival Hillary Clinton and their photo-finish finale in Indiana, nine more of the Democratic Party elite with free votes on the nomination contest have swung over to the Illinois senator.
5189	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	The trickle of support is predicted to turn into a flood, with only six primaries now left in their marathon battle to carry the party's flag into the November presidential elections against Republican John McCain.
5190	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Edwards, who dropped out of the close race in late January, stopped short of endorsing Obama on Friday, but said he has virtually wrapped up the contest, ahead of the last primaries on June 3.
5191	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"Let's just assume that Barack is the nominee because it's headed in that direction," he told NBC television.
5192	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	He added he thought Obama, who is on a historic quest to be the country's first black president, also had a "better chance" to beat McCain.
5193	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	While the former first lady had fought a good campaign, "the problem is the numbers," Edwards said, referring to the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the party's nomination.
5194	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who is also seeking to make history by being the first woman elected to the Oval Office, trails behind Obama in the number of pledged delegates to the party's nominating convention in August.
5195	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And while she still holds the lead in the number of superdelegates, whose vote will be decisive in who wins the party nomination, Obama is hot on her heels.
5196	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Independent pollsters RealClearPolitics.com on Friday put Obama ahead with 1,854 delegates, including 265 superdelegates, compared to 1,696 for Clinton, who has pocketed some 272 superdelegates.
5197	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	That leaves more than 250 superdelegates still uncommitted, at least publicly.
5198	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In a further blow to Clinton's White House hopes, another one of the party grandees defected from her side Friday.
5199	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"After careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that Barack Obama can best bring about the change that our country so desperately wants and needs," Congressman Donald Payne told the Newark Star-Ledger.
5200	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	And three other superdelegates also came out for Obama.
5201	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	His campaign announced that Ed Espinoza, a Democratic National Committee member from California, was backing Obama, while The Oregonian reported that Representative Peter Defazio pledged his support to him.
5204	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	"We think the country needs change and we think now is the time."
5206	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Clinton, however, has vowed no surrender and plunged straight back into campaigning before the May 13 primary in West Virginia, where she is favored in polls.
5207	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	On Friday she was in Oregon, which will hold its primary along with Kentucky on May 20.
5208	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	Obama has said he could declare victory after the May 20 primaries which may put him over the top, in terms of elected delegates.
5209	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In that event, "we can make a pretty strong claim that we have got the most runs and it's the ninth inning and we have won," Obama said Thursday, using a baseball analogy.
5210	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	In another sign of his growing stature, Obama was mobbed by Democratic lawmakers during an unannounced visit to Congress on Thursday.
5211	AFP_ENG_20080509.0144.LDC2009T13	At least 10 superdelegates escorted him out of one meeting, jostling to get into the camera shot with him, despite not having publicly announced their support.

5232	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The battles took place near a military camp in Ladha in South Waziristan between Wednesday and Friday, said army spokesman Maj. Gen. Waheed Arshad.
5233	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"The militants suffered heavy casualties, but we cannot give any specific number on their dead," he said, without giving further details.
5234	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The six suspects, one of whom is a retired army major with alleged links to al-Qaida, were arrested in December in raids in different parts of eastern Punjab province.
5235	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The arrests were only made public within the past week.
5237	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We found explosives, suicide belts and maps of military installations" in their hideouts, he said.
5239	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	The official said the suspects were "brainwashed" by clerics in the area.
5240	APW_ENG_20080112.0653.LDC2009T13	"We learned from them that they wanted to attack the army to avenge the killings of fellow militants," he said.

5335	AFP_ENG_20070213.0296.LDC2009T13	The breakdown in the narrowly-divided Senate is 51 Democrats to 49 Republicans, meaning bills require a greater degree of bipartisan support to pass.

5431	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	When AgriBioTech, the world's leading seller of forage and turfgrass seed, filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, agriculture officials say it put farmers at an even graver risk.
5432	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The bankruptcy has already caused an estimated loss of more than $100 million in agriculture revenue nationwide.
5433	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Founded in 1995, ABT sought to consolidate the seed industry through mergers and acquisitions.
5434	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By 1999, the company had successfully purchased 34 smaller seed distributors.
5435	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	For the past five years, ABT has been the nation's main provider of alfalfa and other seeds used in crops such as corn, soybean, wheat and other vegetables.
5436	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	The company has also supplied the turfgrass-grounding for many major league athletic facilities, and its product was even used by White House landscapers.
5437	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Agriculture officials in Washington and in Western states say ABT's bankruptcy is having a domino effect across the country.
5438	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Crop farmers, who are already struggling nationwide, must cope without being able to purchase seed from ABT, which could lead to even more dramatic losses.
5439	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Even the John Deere Company has been affected, reporting an estimated $800,000 in cancelled farm equipment orders in the last two weeks.
5440	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	ABT, however, says it never intended to be a provider for the seed industry, that they wanted to quickly sell off the smaller companies - something they had trouble doing.
5442	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	By September, ABT had reassured its growers through letters and meetings that the company was ``healthy and solvent,'' on its way to almost $400 million in yearly revenue.
5444	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	``They said to stick with them, and now farmers are in a cash-flow crisis with no where to turn.''
5445	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	Also being crippled by ABT's closing are the seed growers who were selling their product to the Nevada-based company.
5446	NYT_ENG_20000216.0440.LDC2007T07	One grower said that nore than 1,000 seed growers indirectly contracted by ABT could still be held responsible for delivering seed without payment for the next two years.

5531	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-01-17 01:28:51 UTC
5534	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
5535	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
5536	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East.
5537	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the United States" and its national security.
5539	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"I'm not surprised at all," he said.
5540	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"It's typical for this Republican administration to ignore environmental protections under the banner of fear."
5541	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and ears.
5542	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
5543	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been fighting the Navy's sonar training, said the group would challenge Bush's exemption.
5544	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises.
5545	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar would have to be shut down when mammals were spotted within 2,200 yards (2,010 meters).
5546	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
5548	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other marine mammals.
5549	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.
5550	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might threaten its ships.

5559	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The state's home insurer of last resort told state regulators Friday that a 25 percent increase in its base rate on Cape Cod would be a major step toward covering the company's costs, but added that it is receptive to offering premium reductions to consumers who install hurricane shutters and roof tie-downs or accept higher deductibles.
5560	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Massachusetts Fair Plan's rate request, which follows the approval of a similar-size increase in October, faced near-united opposition from the attorney general, several Cape lawmakers, and a number of homeowners who came from the Cape to testify.
5561	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	They called a 25 percent increase excessive and warned that it could force many seniors from their homes and trigger an economic meltdown on the Cape.
5562	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"When you add the high cost of home insurance to the high cost of housing, you're going to cripple the market and eventually the state," said Harvey Baumann, a retired surgeon from Wellfleet.
5563	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The price of home insurance is becoming a major issue on the Cape and islands, in New Bedford, and most of Plymouth County.
5564	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Premiums have been rising quickly in those areas because a handful of little-known companies that use computer models to forecast the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes have dramatically raised their damage estimates.
5565	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	These estimates have had a ripple effect throughout the insurance industry.
5566	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Reinsurers, the companies that insure insurance companies against catastrophic events, have raised their rates substantially.
5567	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
5568	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Some companies have decided the risks are too great on the Cape and either reduced their exposure there or walked away, leaving homeowners with no choice for insurance but the Fair Plan.
5569	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
5570	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of them have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the homes on the Cape and islands.
5571	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan, which operates as an independent company but is financially backed by all of the state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
5572	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's current base premium on the Cape is $1,155 and would rise to $1,444 if the pending rate increase is approved.
5573	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan's average premium on the Cape is currently $1,500.
5576	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said rates should be higher, but have been adjusted downward to prevent rate shock.
5577	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	He said the numbers indicate a 75 percent increase in New Bedford is warranted.
5578	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Jane Logan, an insurance broker from Sandwich, said she doesn't understand why rates are so much higher on the Cape than in Boston, which is also on the water.
5579	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	She also charged that the modeling companies operate under the influence of insurers and are churning out estimates that benefit them.
5580	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Other members of the insurance industry question the accuracy of the models, too.
5582	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"I worry that all of these models, though well-intentioned, are biased upward in the states where events are fewest and actual data therefore most sparse," Stone wrote.
5583	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"Rating agencies and the modelers themselves have more to lose by underestimating the risk in seldom-hit locations than overestimating it."

5593	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Gaza's border crossings closed since June, when the Islamic militant Hamas seized control of the territory.
5594	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a time.
5595	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
5596	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	One of the protesters, Salman Fawaz, 55, said he worked as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia and had been home for a visit when Hamas seized control and the borders closed.
5597	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	His work visa in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of those allowed to leave.
5599	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"Both are responsible for our suffering," Fawaz said.
5602	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"It's possible to have an effective, efficient mechanism that will get the human beings of Gaza and out of the enormous jail they are in."

5624	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	"Just three months ago I was at college," said Bojan.
5625	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	"To be honest I still can't believe everything that is happening.
5626	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	"The feeling of scoring here at Camp Nou and then celebrating with my team-mates was incredible."
5628	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Barcelona climb to second level on points with Villarreal who can replace Real at the summit with three points over Almeria on Sunday.
5629	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Sevilla challenged for the title with Real and Barcelona last season but the troubled club fell to their seventh defeat of the season - they only lost nine in the whole of the last campaign - with a 2-1 home reverse against Real Mallorca on Saturday.
5630	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	It does not get any easier for the UEFA Cup holders who host Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday looking to seal their passage to the knockout phase.
5633	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Murcia levelled four minutes after the break with De Lucas rising highest to power in a header.
5634	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	The red mist then descended on Guti who was sent off for stupidly kicking his opponent and Murcia almost won it late on missing one guilt-edged chance.
5635	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Barcelona went into their match with criticism ringing in their ears after former favourite Edmilson, now at Chelsea, claimed there were several black sheep in the dressing room and that some of his former team-mates were slacking in training.
5636	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	"There have been various things that have not helped us but we just concentrated on playing football," explained Bojan.
5638	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Messi went closest for Barcelona missing two glorious opportunities, both of which he created with nimble footwork, either side of the interval.
5639	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	His compatriot Milito showed him how to do it with a brilliant header to break the deadlock.
5641	AFP_ENG_20071124.0020.LDC2009T13	Messi got the goal he merited late on as Barca, who travel to Lyon in midweek, showed the home form of champions but six points from 18 away from home is the problem that needs to be solved.
5644	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	No-one was injured by the device which went off without warning.

5662	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	ETA declared a "permanent" ceasefire in March 2006, raising hopes for an end to the violence.
5663	AFP_ENG_20080729.0258.LDC2009T13	But an ETA bombing at Madrid's airport in December 2006 that killed two men put an end to tentative peace talks with the government and in June 2007 the outfit formally called off its ceasefire.

5674	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Congressional Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a bill to keep the U.S. government open for another week as lawmakers fashioned an omnibus spending bill and sought agreement among themselves and with the White House.
5675	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The House passed the short-term funding bill by a 385-27 vote
5677	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments whose budgets have yet to pass.
5678	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It is expected the omnibus measure will pass by then, allowing Congress to finally adjourn for the year.
5680	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of the politically sacrosanct program.
5681	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But Democrats had yet to resolve differences among themselves, much less with the White House.
5682	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Differences over Iraq and whether to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still to be resolved.
5686	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
5689	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The issue of Iraq has yet to be resolved, though expectations were growing that Senate Democrats would relent and allow Republicans to provide up to $70 billion (euro47.6 billion) in new war funds to the measure, without restrictions that have provoked Bush veto threats, such as a December 2008 target date for withdrawing combat troops.
5691	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps months of wrangling.
5692	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23 billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the funding to increases for domestic programs such as health research, education, grants to state and local governments and energy research.
5694	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat Saturday.
5696	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The measure would fund every Cabinet department except the Pentagon.
5697	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Under Bush's budget, domestic Cabinet departments other than Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would see their budgets frozen.

5717	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	SAN ANTONIO
5718	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues -- through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the election.
5720	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
5722	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	And so ensued a series of ongoing volleys on an issue that, until eclipsed by rising concerns over the economic meltdown, had retained national interest.
5723	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
5724	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Even before the economy took over as the top campaign issue, neither candidate took the initiative to bring up immigration on the trail because both actually share similar views and neither saw a clear opening to gain political muscle.
5726	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State University in San Marcos.
5728	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Through these attack ads, they've found a safe way to make their case on who's the best candidate for Latinos," Subervi said.
5729	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"They've found a common denominator that's not offensive to the broader public."
5730	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Each campaign's point person for Hispanic media accused the other's boss of being the culprit of the ad war while avoiding a direct answer on why it's being conducted only in Spanish.
5732	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unlike McCain, who's only willing to tackle immigration in Spanish so he won't get burned by his party's more restrictionist base, de Jesus said, Obama shares his views in both languages.
5733	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"We don't have anything to fear or hide," he said.
5735	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.
5736	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Their views on the economy, health care, education and national security are just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.

5762	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"A Capital City" was fine for awhile, until Washington's high murder rate in the late 1980s produced an unwanted double meaning.
5763	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	And while residents lined up for "Taxation Without Representation" license plates in 2000, that tagline was more local protest than tourist come-on.

5792	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua)
5793	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	China's government employees should be banned from offering or receiving cigarettes on social occasions as a first step towards the country's goal to minimize the harm of tobacco on people's health.
5794	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Government departments and their employees are responsible for taking the lead in China's tobacco control," said Yan Aoshuang, a deputy to the 11th National People's Congress (NPC) from Beijing.
5795	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Yan said government employees should not be allowed to accept cigarettes for free or at discounted prices from tobacco companies.
5796	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Besides, all government offices should ban smoking in the workplace to ensure a smoking-free environment," she said on the sidelines of the annual parliamentary session.
5797	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Yan said the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television and Ministry of Culture should draft regulations to ban disguised tobacco adverts and scenes of smoking in films or TV plays.
5798	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	"Film producers and cinemas should play anti-smoking adverts during intervals, and all TVs should air these adverts for free at prime time," she said.
5799	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Beijing banned smoking in taxis last October, a latest move toward a smoking- free Olympic Games in August.
5800	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	In a regional ban enacted in 1995, the city put hospitals, schools, theaters, libraries, banks, shops and all means of public transport as smoking-free areas.

5808	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	"It will be a long and difficult investigation," said a source close to the case.
5809	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Investigators were not ruling out any motive for the crime, saying it may have been the work of thieves acting at the behest of an art collector or small-time robbers wanting to get their hands on some valuable loot.

5826	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson's most important contribution in the match so far came when he and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin (28 not out) helped lift Australia from a perilous 128 for 5 in the second innings with a 65-run unbeaten partnership.
5827	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	At stumps Australia was 193-5 wickets and had a lead of 263.
5828	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson compiled a nerveless 32 not out from 67 balls and was ecstatic with his input over the first four days.
5829	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"This test has been the most fun I've ever had playing cricket," he said.
5830	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing learning experience.
5831	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Just batting out there is the most I've ever learnt in an innings."
5832	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson overcame the duel dangers of offspinner Harbhajan Singh, who was responsible for the early damage with 2-76, and the searing reverse swing of Zaheer Khan.
5833	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"It's been an amazing three or four days so far," he said.
5834	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"I'm having more fun than I ever thought I'd have playing cricket.
5835	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I'm just making the most of it and enjoying every second."
5836	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson, 27, was called into the touring squad last month after Andrew Symonds was stood down for disciplinary reasons.
5837	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	It was the end of a long road back from a run of injuries that started when he dislocated a shoulder while fielding in a test against the West Indies in 2005.
5839	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson also chipped in with three wickets as Australia dismissed India for 360 and gained a 70-run first innings lead.
5840	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	He removed Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Saturday before trapping Anil Kumble lbw in the morning session.
5841	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"Wickets to me don't matter," he said.
5842	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"My role is to bowl as tightly as I can and build pressure, to make it extremely hard.
5843	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	I enjoy every wicket I get -- but they're a massive bonus."
5844	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Watson will get more bowling on the final day once Australia decide when to declare its innings and push for victory.
5845	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	Paceman Stuart Clark has a sore elbow that is preventing him from throwing overarm but he is expected to bowl on Monday.
5847	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"The ball is going to reverse swing fairly quickly, which is very handy for our quicks," Watson said.
5848	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	"The wicket is deteriorating a little, but definitely not as much as I thought it would.
5849	APW_ENG_20081012.0400.LDC2009T13	We are going to have to bowl extremely well to bowl the Indians out."

5852	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The regulator said that under the settlement's terms, Citigroup has agreed to effectively buy back 7.4 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it marketed to tens of thousands of customers.
5853	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The deal also requires Citigroup to "liquidate" by the end of 2009 some 12 billion dollars' worth of auction-rate securities it sold to other investors.
5855	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"This settlement in principle is an outstanding example of federal and state regulatory cooperation for the benefit of investors and markets," Thomsen said at a news conference at SEC headquarters in Washington.
5856	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The settlement was announced by federal and state regulators as a widespread credit crunch continues to weigh on major Wall Street banks.
5857	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Officials said the buyback will benefit around 38,000 investors, small businesses and charities who had purchased the securities through Citigroup.
5858	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Auction-rate securities, essentially debt instruments issued by financial firms, municipalities and student-loan companies, typically have a fairly lengthy maturity, but the interest rates on such securities can be volatile and change at weekly and monthly auctions overseen by banks.
5859	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	The SEC said Citigroup had marketed the securities as "liquid" investments, meaning they were almost as safe and accessible as cash, but the regulators said the securities were illiquid, making it hard for investors to reclaim their holdings.
5860	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Such instruments formed a vital and lucrative business for many banks in recent years, but the market for auction-rate securities collapsed in February as the credit squeeze -- which began in the housing and mortgage markets -- worsened.
5862	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	"It will help to restore confidence in this marketplace," Cuomo said, referring to the Citigroup settlement.
5863	AFP_ENG_20080807.0196.LDC2009T13	Cuomo's office is also probing how other big banks marketed auction-rate securities.

5914	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The bewildering crisis in Lebanon has taken another perplexing twist with reports that the gridlocked parliament has agreed to choose the country's top general, Michel Suleiman, as its next president.
5916	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The presidential selection process has been anything but free or fair.
5918	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the power balance in parliament isn't based on election results
5919	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	rather, it tracks the tally of assassinations.
5920	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	After four anti-Syrian lawmakers were murdered, their colleagues have been holed up since September in the Phoenicia Hotel in Beirut, trying to hang on to their slim parliamentary majority by the simple expedient of staying alive.
5922	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The vote to replace him has been delayed six times and is now scheduled for Dec. 6.
5923	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	The United States and France have supported the pro-democracy movement that drew more than a million people into the streets in the Cedar Revolution that succeeded in driving Syria from Lebanon in 2005.
5924	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But the West has not done enough since then to keep Syria or Hezbollah from paralyzing political progress.
5928	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Enter Suleiman, who is no white knight but who might be able to keep Lebanon from a new civil war.
5929	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Originally handpicked by the Syrians, Suleiman refused to use the army to crush pro-democracy demonstrators.
5931	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	Yet he enjoys close ties to Hezbollah and, as army chief, has allowed the smuggling of weapons from Syria to the Islamist fighters.
5933	LTW_ENG_20071201.0056.LDC2009T13	But it should not allow Lebanon to again become ground zero in a proxy war sponsored by Syria and Iran.

5947	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Forecasters said tropical storm conditions are possible on the island by late Saturday night.
5948	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bertha had maximum sustained winds of about 90 mph (150 kph) with some higher gusting.
5949	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm was barely moving but expected to chug north-northwest at about 5 mph (7 kph) later in the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
5950	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	The storm is expected to pass well east of Bermuda, although any inclination toward the west would create stronger winds.
5951	APW_ENG_20080712.0319.LDC2009T13	Bermuda will likely receive up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain in the next two days.

5975	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	While Obama has said he will seek advice from his commanders, their resistance to a faster drawdown could present the new president with a tough political choice between overruling his generals or backing away from his goal.
5976	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	The plan, completed last week, envisions withdrawing two more brigades, or some 7,000 to 8,000 troops, from Iraq in the first six months of 2009, the military officials said.
5977	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	But that would leave 12 combat brigades in Iraq by June 2009, and while declining to be more specific, the officials made clear that the withdrawal of all combat forces under the generals' recommendations would not come until some time after May 2010, Obama's target.
5979	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	They said all participants had sidestepped the details of how to reconcile Obama's timetable for withdrawing combat forces with the more extended one recommended by the generals.
5980	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	A transition official said that in future meetings, "the military will get a chance to articulate their preferences."
5981	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	In the campaign, Obama said he would not hesitate to overrule his commanders.
5982	NYT_ENG_20081217.0168.LDC2009T13	By early December, however, he signaled some flexibility when he said that he still wanted combat troops out of Iraq in 16 months but that he would also listen to the recommendations of his generals.

6017	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	America's growing love affair with energy-efficient cars is starting to take a toll on the nation's crumbling highways and roads.
6018	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Requiring fewer fill-ups at the pumps, the vehicles are putting a pinch on the federal Highway Trust Fund -- the major government funding source for highway and mass-transit projects.
6019	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
6020	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	To be fair, federal officials say, it's not just energy-efficient autos that are sucking the fund dry.
6021	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
6022	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for each gallon of gas.
6023	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
6024	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"This total dependence on gas tax isn't working anymore."
6025	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters also chairs the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that is reviewing the situation and will make recommendations to Congress in a report this year.
6027	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
6028	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
6029	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
6030	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
6031	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.
6032	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in Atlanta.

6034	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	After the commission files its report, legislators could decide to adopt its recommendations or use them as a guide for funding federal projects, said Chris Bonanti, special assistant to the administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration and staff liaison to the commission.

6039	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
6040	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
6041	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund surfaced in 2005.
6042	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
6045	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
6046	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Taylor acknowledged that over the years, automotive technology has made all cars and trucks more fuel-efficient and contributed to fewer trips to the pump.
6047	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
6049	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
6050	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
6052	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
6053	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
6054	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
6056	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.
6057	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.
6058	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nobody wants to pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what they're currently paying."

6080	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Shark fin soup might taste good.
6081	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But it won't do much for cancer.
6082	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Shark cartilage, a widely used alternative therapy for cancer, did not help patients with lung cancer live longer, according to the results of one of the first rigorous studies of the approach.
6083	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But two smaller studies showed some preliminary but encouraging evidence that two other complementary therapies, ginseng and flaxseed, might have some benefit for cancer patients.
6085	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It is relatively unusual for this meeting to highlight alternative therapies, but doctors here said that might be changing.
6086	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	They acknowledge that many of their patients are taking these supplements -- widely available in health food stores -- and asking them about them.
6087	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	So, they said, well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine whether these approaches are helpful or harmful.
6088	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks," said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University, who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.
6089	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
6091	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Charles Lu of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the trial's lead investigator, said there was reason to believe the cartilage might work.
6092	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Cartilage has been found to contain factors that can impede the formation of blood vessels.
6093	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And cutting off the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with other drugs.
6094	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had died by that point.
6095	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Those who got a placebo had a median survival of 15.6 months.
6096	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
6097	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage extract was given as a liquid that the patients drank twice a day.
6098	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Results were somewhat more promising, though far less definitive, for flaxseed.
6099	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center, involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have their prostates removed.
6100	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	After the glands were removed about a month later, the tumors were studied.
6101	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It was found that the tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did not.
6102	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight fatigue, which is common in people with cancer.
6103	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The study involved 282 patients with various types of cancer.
6104	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	About one quarter of the patients who took one of the two higher doses of powdered extract of ginseng root, either 1,000 or 2,000 milligrams a day, reported that their fatigue had become "moderately better" or "much better."
6105	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That contrasted with only one 10th of those who took either a smaller amount of ginseng or a placebo.
6106	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Doctors said that it was too early to recommend that patients take flaxseed or ginseng, though they said the supplements were not harmful.
6107	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Debra L. Barton, an associate professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic and the lead investigator of the ginseng study, cautioned that many ginseng supplements do not use the Wisconsin ginseng used in the study.
6108	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And the quality and quantity of active ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
6109	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The investigators said the mechanisms of action of the flaxseed and the ginseng were not well understood.
6111	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"The theory is ginseng would help the body moderate the negative things going on," she said.
6112	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	In a more conventional study presented here, researchers in Europe found that preventive radiation therapy to the head reduces the risk that tumors will spread to the brain in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
6113	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The treatment also helped patients live longer.
6114	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of all lung cancer cases, but it is an aggressive type.
6115	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Previous studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small area.
6116	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
6118	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That compared with 40.4 percent in a control group.
6119	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Some 27.1 percent of the treated patients were alive a year later, twice as many as the 13.3 percent of the control group.

6137	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"Some want Hanukkah at that same level of commercialization as Christmas, because that makes everyone more aware of the holiday.

6139	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	They want more separation to avoid the mode of thinking that Hanukkah is somehow intertwined with Christmas."

6156	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	So while families still buy replacement candles for menorahs or oil for traditional lamps for cooking, other old-school gifts have largely fallen out of style.

6370	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU suspended financing fuel deliveries for Gaza's power plant -- which provides some 25 percent of electricity in the territory -- over fears that Hamas would benefit from the aid.
6371	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The EU blacklists Hamas as a terror group and refuses to have any dealings with the Islamists.
6372	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	If it provides fuel to a power plant, and Hamas earns money from that plant's production, the bloc could be seen to be indirectly financing the movement.
6373	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
6374	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
6375	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would function independently.
6377	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
6378	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
6380	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
6381	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	He said the fuel cuts were "the result of the illegal takeover of control electricity company by the Hamas putschists, and the collecting of citizens' (electricity) bills to pay members of its militia."
6382	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
6383	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15, with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.

6429	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The lines formed at dawn and remained long throughout the day -- hundreds upon hundreds of Venezuelans queuing up to buy scarce milk, chicken and sugar at state-run outdoor markets staffed by soldiers in fatigues.
6431	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"You have to get in line and you have to be lucky," said Maria Fernandez, a 64-year-old housewife who was buying milk and chicken on Sunday.
6432	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She said trying to find milk is a constant frustration.
6433	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with the last can.
6434	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The long lines for basic foods at subsidized prices are paradoxical for an oil-rich nation that in many ways is a land of plenty.
6436	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Yet other foods covered by price controls -- eggs, fresh chicken -- periodically are hard to find in supermarkets.
6437	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Fresh milk has become a luxury, and even baby formula is scarcer nowadays.
6438	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for re-election indefinitely.
6440	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
6441	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The government's price controls are also "totally divorced" from reality -- in some cases below production costs -- making it unprofitable for suppliers to sell their products at official prices, said economist Pedro Palma of the Caracas consulting firm MetroEconomica.
6442	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	More investment is needed in agriculture but the government's agrarian reform effort -- assuming control of vast farmlands and offering them to poor farmers -- has made traditional producers reluctant to invest, he said.
6443	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	And importers also face hurdles.
6444	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Currency exchange controls imposed in 2003 by the government require state approval to obtain dollars at the official rate.
6445	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Those without approval regularly turn to the black market, buying dollars for about three times the fixed rate.
6446	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	To compound the problems, Palma said, some of the products Venezuela looks to import, such as milk and sugar, are scarce internationally.
6447	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Many of those in line at the Megamercal said they are grateful to Chavez for subsidized markets offering prices far cheaper than commercial supermarkets.
6448	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	But they also complained of struggling to find milk, chicken, sugar and cooking oil elsewhere at prices set by the government.
6449	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"I arrived at 6 in the morning to get in line," said Doris Bastida, 32, a mother of four who wheeled an infant son in a stroller.
6450	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had been waiting for about four hours by the time she reached the entrance.
6451	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"What am I going to do?
6452	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	I don't have anywhere else to go," she said.
6453	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Powdered milk is sold by black-market street vendors at US$10 (euro6.80) or more per kilogram (US$4.50/euro3 or more per pound) -- about twice the regulated price and four times the price offered by the state markets.
6454	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Bastida said she still believes in Chavez and plans to vote in favor of his reforms "so that things will get better."
6455	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Plus, she said, if "everyone votes 'no,' they're going to take the Megamercal away from us."
6456	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run again in 2012.
6457	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"We have to vote 'no,'" said 50-year-old Fatima Rodriguez.
6458	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"Do you think it's good to be here waiting in line?"
6459	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Chavez says he is aiming to boost agriculture with projects including state-supported sugar harvesting and a milk processing plant started with help from Iran.
6460	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	For now, Venezuela still imports most of its food, and imports overall have more than doubled in the past three years.
6462	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He said leg of pork -- a popular holiday dish -- was imported because local suppliers declined to participate.
6464	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	He suggested there were political motives behind the shortages.
6465	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"That's the objective, that the people reach the point of desperation," Oropeza said.
6467	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Oropeza said the government sold a record 5,948 metric tons (6,557 tons) at its weekend markets nationwide.
6468	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	At one state market in Caracas, the line snaked around a block, while soldiers manned barricades at the entrance.
6469	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	A banner hung above read "Continue on with Chavez."
6470	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Red campaign signs plastered on walls urged: "Yes, with Chavez."
6471	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Factory worker Eugenio Ruiz praised Chavez for the subsidized food and said he plans to vote "yes" so that Chavez can run again.
6472	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	"Look at all he's done for us," Ruiz said, explaining he thinks the situation would be worse without Chavez.

6475	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Margaret Johnson had such a tough time finding fun learning games for her daughters that she created a company to market a game she created that uses computer play to teach reading.
6476	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	With technology powerhouse Microsoft as a partner, Johnson on Wednesday debuted the first of what she hopes will be a line of computer games that revives a moribund "edutainment" market for children.
6477	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" launched by Sabi Inc. immerses children in an animated world that they control and shape by using software developed by Microsoft Labs.
6478	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	On-screen boys and girls coax players into helping with missions that involve drawing houses, trees or other objects brought to animated life and into understanding increasingly sophisticated sentences along the way.
6479	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"ItzaBitza" is Sabi's "stab at establishing a new category for kids gaming," Johnson said.
6480	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"We wanted to have a fun game fine-tuned to the way children learn," she said.
6481	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity stakes in firms.
6483	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Sabi consulted learning specialists and brought in engineers that worked on videogames for Microsoft's XBox 360 consoles and computers running the Windows operating system.
6484	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	They set out to create a computer game for children that bolsters reading skills along with creative expression.
6485	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Out of that came Living Ink, which we hope delights children in that what they draw comes to life and they interact with it," Johnson said.
6486	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"What has happened in the edutainment field is games feel like work.
6487	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	It is our goal and passion to establish this category of games that children actually think are fun and, you know what, you happen to start reading."
6488	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Some believe that the education entertainment computer game industry has languished because titles tend to take on the appearance of interactive school assignments based on academic curricula.
6489	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
6490	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market," said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures Program.
6491	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"There aren't that many games today that offer the rich, engaging experience of other games with the educational component.
6492	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	I do think this will resonate with parents, big time."
6493	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Popular cerebrum exercising titles such as Nintendo's "Brain Age" are "Brain candy" aimed at getting adults to keep their minds in shape with daily workouts, according to Johnson.
6494	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Mia Todd, a mother of four whose family tested the game, said her children "experience something new and exciting" each time they play the game.

6497	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	EU to propose deep cuts in new car emissions
6498	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for cleaner air.
6500	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	New passenger cars currently emit about 160 grammes of CO2 per kilometre.
6501	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Under the proposal, auto makers would be required to limit average emissions across their fleet to 130 grammes per kilometer by improving the technology they use.
6502	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	A further 10 grammes would be cut through requirements on tyre, equipment and fuel makers to improve air-conditioning efficiency, tyre pressure monitoring and gear shift indicators while increasing the use of biofuels and other measures.
6503	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	With car makers failing to meet existing voluntary targets, the commission was in agreement that binding limits were needed, but Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas and Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen were divided over how much an effort should come from car makers.
6504	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Dimas sought a tough binding limit of 120 grammes for car makers while Verheugen wanted measures to be shared with tyre, equipment and fuel makers, easing the burden on the automobile industry, which he says employs 12 million people directly or indirectly in Europe.
6505	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The compromise proposal is to be officially presented after its adoption by other commissioners.
6506	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission is aiming to present by the end of the year formal legislation that will then have to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.
6507	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European car industry is up in arms about the proposals, which it says could force them to relocate production elsewhere.
6508	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European car industry association said in a statement.
6509	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"It will lead to a loss of jobs and a relocation of production outside Europe," it added.
6511	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission says they have so far only decreased emissions by 12.4 percent, which the EU executive describes as "not satisfactory."
6512	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	Road transport pollution has risen 30 percent since 1990 and now makes up more than a quarter of the EU's carbon dioxide emissions, with half of that from passenger cars.
6513	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission's hesitation to bring forward plans on car emissions cast a shadow over a recent drive to fight climate change, which was one of the main planks of a wide-ranging energy action plan it unveiled last month.
6514	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Just a month ago, the EU unveiled its new energy strategy to great fanfare, with claims that the EU was going to play a real global leadership role -- and yet here we see it falling at the first hurdle, failing at the first test," said Green euro-deputy Caroline Lucas.
6518	XIN_ENG_20080731.0146.LDC2009T13	During a TV message, Chavez said that he was "interested, and we are going to nationalize the bank (Santander)."

6562	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q and A: Fashion
6564	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I've been trying to find a large, roomy leather tote for carrying to work, but I am debating if it's really worth the back pain for such a heavy load.
6565	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is the large tote trend going to die down this spring?
6566	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
6567	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
6568	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Do you want to carry magazines, files, bottled water and gym clothes with you every day?
6569	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Then a big tote is essential.
6570	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If not, a smaller bag might be right for you.
6571	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	The gargantuan bag (a la Chanel's Cabas style) is heading "out" of fashion, but if you need a big bag I say go for it.
6572	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	One thing to note in the back pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their design.
6573	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it -- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for my back, even when empty.
6574	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	So it's best to buy these in person.
6576	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	But I'm at a loss for a replacement bag that I can wear over my shoulder and across my chest, yet still fit in my lunch, a book, my iPod, phone, etc., etc.
6577	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Tips?
6579	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I saw some great leather (or maybe they were pleather?)
6580	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	messenger bags at Target.
6581	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	They cost $30 to $40 each and were nice and roomy, with some cool, understated hardware that distinguished them from the pack.
6582	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'd also suggest scouring the men's furnishings dept at department stores -- they often stock more of these styles than ladies' bag departments.
6583	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: Four of us girls (late 20s and early 30s) are going to ... (the ballet) on a Saturday night.
6584	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Some of them want to get really dressed up, but I'm trying to convince them that if we show up in long dresses, we'll probably be outnumbered.
6585	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A( Kelly): I would advise against wearing a long dress.
6586	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	It's just not that formal an occasion, and you'll be far more comfortable and look much chicer in a short dress or pants and a dressy top.

6588	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Would you suggest I wear a pashmina or jacket to ward off the chill?
6589	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Also, should my accessories be understated and neutral, like golds and browns?
6590	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I'm also wondering about bare legs this time of year.
6591	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Should I wear Spanx and closed-toed shoes, or are open-toed sandals (gold) acceptable?
6592	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
6593	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	1.
6594	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A cropped jacket of some sort would be more chic than a pashmina, which is a perfectly acceptable but not terribly fashion-forward choice.
6595	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.
6596	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	2.
6597	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, matte bronze or even dark burgundy would look great here.
6598	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	If you choose gold, make sure it's nothing too sparkly-bright.
6599	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	3.
6600	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
6601	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	And if this weather keeps up, they'll be practical, too!
6602	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Q: I recently purchased a long, black, boyfriend-style cardigan ... (that) ends about two inches above my knee with buttons going down the front and has three-quarter-length sleeves.
6603	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
6604	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): You could try a dress if it's a slinky, Calvin Klein/Helmut Lang-type sheath style, cut from a thin T-shirt fabric.
6605	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look lumpy under the cardigan.
6606	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Alternately, I'd try wearing the cardigan as a dress on its own, or layering it over skinny jeans.
6607	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital) last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.
6611	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori said, however, that she believed the church was being asked to pause, not retreat from its positions on the divisive issues.
6612	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``If we can lower the emotional reactivity in the midst of this current controversy, we just might be able to find a way to live together,'' she said.
6617	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead, he said, it should ``get on with the work of the Gospel.''
6620	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	(Optional add end)
6621	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	At several points during her hour-long webcast from New York, in which she answered questions submitted by phone, e-mail and from a studio audience, she acknowledged the anguish and anxiety the conflict was causing those on all sides.
6622	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	That pain was evident in several of the questions.
6624	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Another woman, who said she was listening to the webcast with her partner, said she could not view the proposed restrictions for gays with the understanding and patience that Jefferts Schori advised.
6625	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``It seems very harsh,'' the caller said.
6626	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	Jefferts Schori, who has expressed support for gay clergy and blessing same-sex unions, told the woman she shared some of her concerns.
6627	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	But she repeated her call for forbearance.
6628	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``We are being pushed toward a decision by impatient forces within and outside this church who hunger for clarity,'' she said.
6629	LTW_ENG_20070301.0125.LDC2009T13	``That hunger for clarity at all costs is an anxious response to discomfort in the face of change.''

6631	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	TOKYO 2007-01-13 12:19:22 UTC
6634	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	H5N1 has killed 157 people worldwide.
6636	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	By Saturday, the death toll has risen to 3,800, public broadcaster NHK said.
6637	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The National Institute of Animal Health near Tokyo has identified the virus as the type-A influenza of the H5 family and is running DNA tests to determine further details, Tanaka said.
6638	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Further epidemic prevention procedures, including sterilization of the farm, are also under way, he added.
6639	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The confirmation of the virulent H5 virus means all remaining 10,000 breeding and egg-laying chickens raised at the farm must be culled, beginning as early as Sunday, Tanaka said.
6640	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Since 2003, the virulent H5N1 of bird flu has claimed at least 157 lives worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
6641	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	There has been one confirmed human case involving the H5N1 virus in Japan, but no reported human deaths.
6643	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japan has had several other outbreaks of less virulent bird flu viruses not harmful to humans in 2005.
6644	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The government has set up a taskforce and ordered nearly 20 poultry farms within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius of the affected operator to halt shipments of eggs and chickens for the time being.
6645	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	The Agriculture Ministry also ordered a nationwide inspection of poultry farms to detect any signs of sick birds, and environment officials began a national survey to look into the possibility that a bird flu virus might have been brought by migratory birds from other parts of Asia.

6649	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Tuareg rebels in Niger released 25 soldiers who were taken hostage nine months ago in the country's troubled northern desert, the government said on Monday.
6652	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	In neighboring Mali, the government thanked Gadhafi for "his brotherly work" in ending the crisis.
6654	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He, too, thanked a foundation set up by Gadhafi for the men's release.
6655	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The Tuaregs, the light-skinned nomads that have made a home out of the Sahara desert, have long been at odds with the darker- skinned rulers of the band of countries cutting across their native sand dunes -- especially in Mali and Niger.
6656	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	The latest spate of hostage takings began last year following a resurgence of hostilities between the ethnic Tuareg rebels and the government of the two countries.
6658	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	Albade said that Niger "wanted to reiterate the gratitude it feels toward the Gadhafi foundation for its good work."
6660	APW_ENG_20080310.1947.LDC2009T13	He said the government would only negotiate with these rebels once they put down their arms.

6664	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Under pressure from global trade rivals, EU nations were expected to push former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions on Tuesday to complete negotiations on new regional free trade pacts by the end of 2007, deals which aid groups fear could lead to more harm than good.
6665	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over 55 trade development ministers from the European Union and its former colonies are to debate how they will meet an end-of- year World Trade Organization deadline to conclude the controversial market-opening trade talks.
6666	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Regional "economic partnership" trade pacts with the 27-nation EU are supposed to be concluded this year, but the talks have been stalled for months due to market access, good governance and aid levels.
6667	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Many of the 78-poor nation grouping known as the ACP group of former European colonies are also loathe to give up over three decades of dependency on privileged access to EU markets.
6670	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ministers and officials were to debate how to provide energy to the poorest nations in Africa, while making sure the electricity they use come from renewable sources.
6671	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Wolfowitz appealed to the EU ministers at informal dinner talks Monday night that the trade pacts go hand in hand with substantial aid to build up key infrastructure like roads and electrical grids, which are critical for an economy to function.
6672	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	"What they need right now is more financial assistance, there are many other things as well but you can't build a private sector without electricity and roads," Wolfowitz said.
6673	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The trade accords foresee gradual market openings in parallel with EU funding for good governance and reforms in developing nations so as to spur trade among them.
6674	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Aid groups however, have derided the negotiations saying the deals threaten to undermine poverty reduction.
6675	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Klaus Schilder from aid group World Economy, Ecology and Development, WEED, said the trade pacts on the table "go beyond what is being negotiated" at world trade talks, and include such areas like investment, services and other business sectors which developing countries do not want to include in the talks.
6676	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	Over the past month EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and EU Development Commissioner Louis Michel held talks with the six regional groupings negotiating trade pacts with the EU.

6680	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The European Commission said all the talks concluded so far that they need to create "the widest possible market access" to the EU's vast market for ACP regions.
6681	APW_ENG_20070313.0058.LDC2009T13	The ACP nations are mostly ex-European colonies.

6686	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report estimates that between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion people will be suffering from water scarcity problems by 2080 and between 200 million and 600 million more people will be going hungry.

6691	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report will be followed in April by volumes focusing on the impacts of climate change and on the social-economic costs of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
6692	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	A chapter on Australia in the report on global impacts warns that coral bleaching in the Barrier Reef is likely to become an annual occurrence by as early as 2030 due to warmer, more acidic seas.
6693	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Bleaching occurs when the plant-like organisms that make up coral die and leave behind the white limestone skeleton of the reef.
6697	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The human and economic costs of climate change are likely to be highest in poor countries, with water shortages crippling many African nations and increased coastal flooding hitting low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and many Pacific islands, the report says.

6744	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	retires from tennis
6746	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Martina Hingis said Thursday she has been accused of testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon, and then announced her retirement from professional tennis.
6747	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
6748	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous that I've decided to confront it head on by talking to the press," she said.
6749	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I am frustrated and angry.
6750	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I believe that I am absolutely 100 percent innocent."
6751	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Her voice broke as she fought back tears in reading the statement.
6752	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	At the end, she took no questions and left the news conference.
6754	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said the positive test, which could lead to a doping suspension of up to two years, led to her retirement because she doesn't want to spend years fighting the case.
6755	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
6756	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis returned to the sport two years ago after a four-year absence because of injuries.
6759	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	On March 31, 1997, Hingis became the youngest female player ever to lead the world rankings.
6760	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She was 16 years, 6 months and 1 day at the time.
6761	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She is currently ranked No. 19.
6762	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, who lost in the third round of the U.S. Open, hasn't played since her second-round loss to Peng Shuai of China, 7-5, 6-1, in Beijing on Sept. 19.
6764	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Both were banned for three months and ordered to return prize money and forfeit rankings points.
6765	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Others have tested positive for a variety of banned substances.
6766	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she was accused by "an outsource testing company" of taking cocaine during Wimbledon.
6767	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She said she was "shocked and appalled" when notified that her urine sample came back positive after the loss to Granville.
6768	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.

6775	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample taken during Wimbledon.
6776	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.

6812	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
6813	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
6815	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedestrians have flowed back, giving hope of renewal to many people in the area.
6816	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"This place has gone from being an area in which you risked your life to something approaching pleasurable," said Ramon Martinez, a waiter at a restaurant on the boulevard for the last four years.
6817	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
6818	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Citing morgue records, newspapers here reported 265 killings last month, which would make it one of the deadliest in the city's recorded history.
6819	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The police disputed the figure, saying that there were 169 killings.
6821	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Considered a contingent of Chavez's urban political base, the vendors had for several years successfully prevented the authorities from removing them or collecting taxes.
6822	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the boulevard's exclusive shops and outdoor cafes had shut down, as their customers avoided the area.
6823	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Before the efforts began to restrict them, the city had about 150,000 of these vendors, according to Cedice, a research organization.
6824	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors have created an anarchic feel to many streets and plazas, including hundreds perched around the National Assembly downtown, fueling criticism of a government that preaches socialism but tolerates unfettered capitalism on its streets.
6826	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"At least they should use Cuba as an example in this respect."
6827	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Along Sabana Grande, whose name refers to a region of savannas and tabletop mesas in southern Venezuela, the facades of Art Deco apartments remain crumbling or covered in grit.
6828	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Squatters have occupied some abandoned buildings.
6829	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But the police are more visible, and mimes and street musicians now attract growing crowds.
6830	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	A few reminders of the boulevard's past survive, like Suma, a cavernous bookstore, and the open-air Gran Cafe.
6832	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"The vendors have a right to work, but they should be given the opportunity to do something more creative," said Janette Rodriguez while passing out copies of La Mancha, a leftist newspaper.
6833	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
6835	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
6838	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching transformation, though, after migration surged from other regions.
6839	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
6840	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
6841	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle with each other outside."
6842	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
6843	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Critics of the municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic because it took place only after the president won re-election in December.
6846	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
6847	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	An earlier effort would have been difficult.
6848	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
6849	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
6850	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors say promises of government loans have gone unmet.
6851	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
6852	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."
6853	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's revolution.
6854	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedro Aponte, 72, a retired fruit seller, relied on nostalgia to discuss the boulevard's potential.
6855	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We have to conserve this place," said Aponte he set up chess sets a recent morning under an awning, where a growing crowd gathers each day to play.
6856	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Officials even organized a small Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.
6857	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We would throw something called smile powder on the girls," Aponte reminisced.
6858	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They would smile," he said.

6953	AFP_ENG_20080429.0159.LDC2009T13	The Hornets went 56-26 to win their first Southwest Division title and place second in the Western Conference.
6954	AFP_ENG_20080429.0159.LDC2009T13	They also set a club record with 26 road victories.
6955	AFP_ENG_20080429.0159.LDC2009T13	Scott began his NBA coaching career in 2000 with the New Jersey Nets, going 149-139 in 3 1/2 seasons.
6956	AFP_ENG_20080429.0159.LDC2009T13	He helped lift the Nets from the bottom of the Eastern Conference to the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003, losing both times.

6968	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	On the major issues, such abortion, race, religion, the death penalty, gun rights, gay rights and presidential power, the justices have been sharply divided.
6969	LTW_ENG_20080929.0015.LDC2009T13	The court regularly splits 5-4 on those issues, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy casting the deciding vote.

7042	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, topping the agenda of a meeting of alliance defence ministers Thursday, now comprises almost 35,500 troops.
7043	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to official figures released Wednesday.
7044	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had rotated among different nations every six months.
7045	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	NATO expanded its operations from Kabul and the relatively quiet north and west of the conflict-torn country, to the south and east, where a resurgent Taliban militia has opposed it.
7047	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Its fighters seized control of one town last week.
7048	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Britain, along with Canada -- with 2,500 troops -- and the Netherlands, 2,200, have born the brunt of the fighting in the Taliban's heartland in the south, and NATO commanders have urged the allies to inject more resources.
7049	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	On the eve of the NATO meeting in Seville, Germany announced plans to deploy six reconnaissance jets -- and the 500 personnel needed to run them -- but it insists they will play no combat role.
7051	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Poland has started deploying around 1,000 troops, which are likely to be in place by April.
7053	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Officials say, though, that no new offers are likely to be made in Seville.
7055	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	The way it plays out could determine the future of the 60-year- old military alliance and whether its vocation involves combat operations, or more modestly just peacekeeping and reconstruction.

7066	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
7071	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
7072	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
7074	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
7076	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
7079	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"I have always said that all options are on the table but the first option for the United States is to solve this problem diplomatically," Bush told reporters in the White House Rose Garden.
7083	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful and it needs nuclear energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out.
7086	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Analysts fear that Iran would cease crude exports and could block key Gulf oil shipping routes if attacked.
7087	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"When just a statement (about a possible attack) makes this much volatility in the market, can you imagine that if any action happens ... what would be the result in the oil market?"

7090	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The comments, made at the World Petroleum Congress industry event, followed signs of growing tension between crude producing and consuming countries over who is to blame for record crude prices.

7096	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	The vacation was the family's first.

7099	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	It has to be one on one," Rospars Keffer said.
7100	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	About a year ago, Michael Keffer's sister, Wendy Heaton, sent an e-mail asking DeGeneres to consider the Keffer family if she were to dedicate a show to a deserving family.
7102	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	In January, the comedienne surprised Heaton and Rospars Keffer with a phone call during a taping of the show, telling them she would provide a trip for both families.

7105	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Meals were paid for by Disney, which also let the Keffer family spend one night at the Cinderella Castle Suite, replete with a butler.

7107	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"It really was incredible," Rospars Keffer said.
7108	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	During the trip, the family went on rides, interacted with characters at meals, lounged at the hotel pool and spent time with the Heaton family and other relatives who also went along.

7110	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	For Riley, who is conversational, the monorail was the best part of the trip.
7111	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	Although Abbie, who does not have functional language skills, had difficulty getting through the dark and confined waiting line areas, Rospars Keffer said she loved the roller coasters.
7112	LTW_ENG_20080424.0148.LDC2009T13	"The faster and the scarier it was," she said, "Abbie liked it more."

7129	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Inc. on Monday, accusing the drugmaker of defrauding the main health benefit program for the poor and other government insurance programs by hiding the risks of heart problems associated with its pain medication Vioxx.
7131	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	For its residents receiving Medicaid assistance, New York City paid a substantial share of those costs.
7132	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit says tens of millions of dollars (euros) were paid for prescriptions for patients with preexisting heart conditions.
7133	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Those funds would not have been spent had the risks associated with Vioxx been known, court papers say.
7135	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, removed Vioxx from the market in Sept. 30, 2004 because it doubled risk of heart attack and stroke.
7136	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	Before stopping Vioxx sales, court papers say, Merck "undertook a concerted and tenacious campaign of false and fraudulent statements to minimize the import and seriousness" of the possible association between Vioxx and heart problems.
7137	APW_ENG_20070917.1274.LDC2009T13	This "disinformation campaign" continued until a month before Merck ceased sales of the drug, causing New York doctors to continue writing prescriptions for Vioxx that they otherwise would not have written, according to the lawsuit.

7196	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	European space experts worked Monday to learn what caused one of four engines to malfunction shortly after the maiden launch late Saturday of an automated space transport headed to the international space station.
7197	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Officials with the European Space Agency said all other systems on the state-of-the-art spacecraft were working well following its launch from the agency's base in South America, and they did not expect the engine problem to keep the transport, named the Jules Verne, from docking with the space station next month.
7198	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The glitch developed as NASA prepared the space shuttle Endeavour for a launch scheduled for early Tuesday morning.
7201	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The planned 16-day shuttle mission, the longest so far to the space station, is part of a concerted effort by NASA to finish assembly of the long-delayed space station by September 2010, at which point the three space shuttles will be retired.
7202	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The agency will not have any replacement vehicles to carry astronauts and cargo to the station for at least five years, and the just-launched European "automated transport vehicle" is part of the agency's plan to continue operating during the five-year gap.
7204	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Europeans' Jules Verne, which is carrying 4.6 tons of cargo, is the first of six transport launches the Europeans promised as their contribution to the space station effort.
7205	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The vehicle has taken almost a decade to develop and launch.
7207	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Bonacino said that researchers and engineers were working to fix the problem from mission control in Toulouse, France, and that the problem did not appear to pose any serious threat to the mission.
7208	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	Even if it cannot be fixed, he said, the transport will still be able to dock with the space station.
7209	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	That docking cannot take place, however, until the shuttle Endeavour has arrived and departed -- more than two weeks from Tuesday.
7210	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	With that much time to work on the problem, European space agency officials said they expected to be able to fix it.
7211	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	About half of the Jules Verne's payload is propellant for use by rockets that periodically push the space station higher to compensate for the natural decay of its orbit.
7212	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The rest is oxygen, drinking water and dry goods.
7213	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	After spending four months docked to the station, the transport will carry away waste and will burn up in the atmosphere as the transport plunges to Earth over the southern Pacific Ocean.
7215	LTW_ENG_20080311.0119.LDC2009T13	The Jules Verne is the first automated spacecraft designed to dock with the station in full compliance with the tight safety constraints imposed after the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.

7220	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	They are two angry political warriors bearing grudges from the past, convinced the other is a liar and an incompetent destined to destroy the country.
7222	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	It was then that Zapatero unexpectedly swept to victory, ousting Rajoy's Popular Party from power as enraged voters protested the government's mishandling of terrorist bombings that killed 191 people in Madrid three days before the election.
7223	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The candidates have used this year's campaign not only to lay out starkly different visions for Spain but also to settle personal scores.
7224	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Rajoy still contends that he was a victim of circumstances in 2004, robbed of victory after his party insisted that the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA was responsible for the attack, despite evidence that pointed to radical Islamists.
7225	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, the election swept in a government that lacked legitimacy and since then has abused its mandate by shattering family values, weakening the economy, embracing unworthy immigrants and coddling terrorists.
7227	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	For him, Rajoy is a prisoner of the past who has sought revenge for his electoral loss in 2004 by using the conservative party he heads to try to undermine the government's ability to rule.
7228	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Despite the mudslinging, political analysts and pollsters say neither candidate has managed to excite voters or lay out a coherent vision.
7229	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	But in poll after poll for months, Zapatero has consistently stayed in the lead.
7230	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	The wild card in the election is potential fallout from the chilling gang-style killing of a former city councilman from the Socialist Party on Friday.
7231	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Both the government and the opposition have blamed ETA for the killing.
7232	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Throughout the campaign, Rajoy has attacked Zapatero for negotiating with ETA.
7233	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Zapatero cut off the talks after ETA bombed Madrid's airport in December 2006, then admitted in January of this year that indirect contacts had continued.
7234	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	Since then, Rajoy has accused him of lying.
7235	NYT_ENG_20080308.0082.LDC2009T13	ETA, which has killed more than 800 people over four decades in a bid for an independent Basque homeland, is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union.

7266	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang said the method of cultivation allows rice fields to be playgrounds for ducks, which eat insects and apple snails that harm rice crops and whose excrement can be used as organic fertilizer.
7267	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	But since Fangjung Rice Plant launched the program to use ducks in rice farming in 2006, only six farmers have participated in it, with the total farmland using this method reaching only three hectares, Huang said.
7268	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Hoping that more farmers and consumers will support this unique organic farming technique, Huang said she is trying to get produce generated under the program certified as organic produce.
7269	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She said she is confident this can be achieved within one year.
7270	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang explained that three years is the minimum time it takes for a farm's produce to pass organic examinations.
7271	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Contract farmers have to abide by certain regulations.
7272	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	They have to grow the strain selected by the rice production plant and cannot use any pesticides or chemical fertilizers, Huang said.
7273	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Persuading farmers to switch from the pursuit of production volume to quality is the most difficult part of promoting the farming technique, even though farmers know that it is a good technique passed down by their ancestors, Huang said.
7274	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She is the fourth-generation owner of the plant that was founded in 1926.
7275	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	The six contract farmers currently using this method raise ducks beside their rice farms.
7276	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Three farmers who cultivate a 1.68-hectare plot of land together have had to raise about 500 ducks to help them with their organic efforts, Huang said.
7277	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	"We experimented with creatures like frogs and chicken in carrying out the mission, but found that ducks are the most effective, " Huang said.
7278	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	All produce grown on farmland using this special technique have passed pesticide tests, she emphasized.
7279	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	Huang noted that while ducks eat rice too when there are not many bugs around, they are still beneficial to farmland.
7280	CNA_ENG_20081016.0028.LDC2009T13	She added that having ducks in rice fields is also a good way to attract tourists to the area.

7284	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Girardi did not believe it would be the final time he would manage in the ballpark.
7285	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He expected the Yankees to make the playoffs in his first season, expected the Stadium to live into October in its last season.
7286	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But sometime soon, the Yankees will learn that they have been mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.
7287	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi will stop saying that the Yankees have not yet been eliminated.
7288	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
7289	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The optimist in Girardi, who is present 23 hours 45 minutes a day, has repeated that the Yankees still have a chance for a miracle.
7290	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
7291	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
7292	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We expected more.
7293	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	For whatever reason or whatever number of reasons, we didn't get to where we thought we were going to get."
7295	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
7296	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.

7301	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
7302	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
7303	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think sometimes, managers get blamed too much."
7304	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Confident enough to wear No. 27 as the Yankees chased their 27th World Series title, Girardi is now trying to keep his team from finishing in fourth place.
7306	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Why did Cano and Cabrera stumble under Girardi's tutelage?
7307	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
7308	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?

7311	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi says he still can make that 27 on his back meaningful.
7312	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You don't really know what it's like to be the manager of the New York Yankees until you go through it," he said.
7313	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like people will say, 'I know what you're going through.'
7314	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.

7316	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked to describe what it was like, he said he could not because he was unsure what people imagined the job to be.
7317	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
7318	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He acknowledged that he was guarded with information about injuries because he did not want to give opponents the tiniest morsel of data.
7319	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
7320	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
7321	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.
7322	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I worry about the people who know me understanding why I did something."

7326	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
7327	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins in 2006, needed to improve in other areas.
7328	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
7329	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
7330	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's one thing to be positive, which obviously is what he's trying to do.
7331	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	It's another thing to also be honest about how you really feel and what's going on.
7332	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
7333	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
7334	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
7336	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Tony Pena, the first-base coach, said Girardi would meet with the coaches after games to try to solve problems.
7337	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We suffer," Pena said.
7338	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Everybody suffers.
7339	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We don't want to lose.
7340	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't think our players want to lose, either.
7341	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough road.
7342	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough year."
7343	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Few have had as tough a year as Cano, whose average has plummeted to .260 this season from .306 last year.
7344	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	His on-base percentage is a sickly .294.
7345	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Larry Bowa, a former third-base coach for the Yankees, said he motivated Cano by getting "in his face."
7346	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
7347	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	In a move that is more about next season than this season, Girardi removed Cano from Sunday's game for not hustling on a fielding play.
7348	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Andy Pettitte said Girardi held several team meetings in which he showed a fiery side, estimating that Girardi had challenged the Yankees as much as Torre ever did.
7349	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
7350	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
7351	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It's like beating a dead horse."
7352	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not specific.
7353	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
7354	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He added that this season's experiences could cause him to change, too.
7355	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi, like the Steinbrenners, said he did not consider a season triumphant unless it ended with a championship.
7356	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There are always "successful things" that happen across 162 games, he said, but how a team finishes is all that is relevant.
7357	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Did you get to where you thought that you should get?"
7358	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said.
7359	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"With this team, right now, the answer is no."
7360	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The final answer will undoubtedly be no.
7361	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The season will end in disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something Girardi had not envisioned.
7362	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Stadium will close earlier than Girardi expected.

7364	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua)
7365	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite a former Bank of China official who allegedly siphoned 1 billion yuan (128 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to Canada, the Beijing Daily reported Friday.
7370	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	According to the report, the accountants of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. reported on Jan. 4, 2005, that more than 293 million yuan had disappeared from the company's account at the Bank of China.
7371	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Other customers also reported the disappearance of huge funds from their BOC accounts.
7372	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The total sum exceeded 1 billion yuan.
7373	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	On Jan. 13, 2005, Zhang Xiaoguang, former chairman of the board of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was charged with embezzlement of public funds and is awaiting trial in China.
7374	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	China has been active in seeking international cooperation in its fight against corruption.
7376	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	The successful extradition from the United States of a Guangdong Province branch head of the Bank of China in 2004 was lauded as a powerful deterrent to corruption.
7377	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Yu Zhendong, the banker, was convicted of misappropriating 483 million U.S. dollars before fleeing to the United States.
7378	XIN_ENG_20070126.0256.LDC2009T13	Sources from the Ministry of Public Security said 800 suspects at large abroad were wanted for economic crimes.

7384	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	But Mann's lawyer Jonathan Samkange said he had only learnt his client had already been flown out when he lodged legal papers on Friday relating to a final appeal against his deportation.
7385	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The idea was that by the time we filed a notice of appeal he would have gone.
7386	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	This was designed to defeat the notice of our appeal," Samkange told AFP.
7387	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"Deporting a person at night is not only mischievous but unlawful."
7388	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann had lost a bid for freedom earlier this week when a high court judge upheld an earlier ruling by magistrates but he was still pinning his hopes on a final appeal before the supreme court.
7389	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	The lawyer had turned up at court on Friday morning to file the appeal papers when he was shown documents confirming the deportation order had been already carried out at the behest of acting attorney general Bharat Patel.
7390	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Patel was also one of the judges at the high court ruling.
7391	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Samkange said the authorities had deliberately concealed the fact Mann had been moved out of the Chikurubi maximum security prison, near Harare.
7392	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"I spoke to the officer in charge of Chikurubi last night and he assured me that he was there," said the lawyer.
7394	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"On 31st January Thursday 2008 at about 0130 hours, I was informed by the police to process the extradition papers of Simon Mann as his appeal had been dismissed," Siziba wrote.
7397	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"They boarded an air force plane which took off about 0450 hours," said Siziba.
7398	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann's legal team applied on Friday for a court order for their client to be returned to Zimbabwe but the application was rejected by a high court judge.
7399	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	"The application has been dismissed because Simon Mann was deported before the appeal was noted at the supreme court," Julia Woods, another of the Briton's lawyers, told AFP after the hearing.
7400	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	An alumnus of Britain's famous Eton school, Mann was arrested with 61 others when their plane landed at Harare international airport in March 2004.
7402	AFP_ENG_20080201.0259.LDC2009T13	Mann said he and his co-accused were on their way to the Democratic Republic of Congo and needed the weapons for a security contract at a mine.

7464	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	SOME HOPE REPORT FINDING HPV IN MORE THAN 25% OF WOMEN DIFFUSES TENSION OVER CONTROVERSIAL CANCER VACCINE
7465	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	HOUSTON
7466	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer, health researchers say.
7468	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The overall prevalence was slightly higher than previous estimates.
7470	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The new report, based upon a national analysis of nearly 2,000 women, was released amid a heated debate in Texas over whether 11 -year-old girls should be required to receive a vaccine that protects women from the virus.
7471	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
7473	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
7474	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
7476	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry said his goal was to protect future generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000 women a year in this country.
7478	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The Texas Medical Association, too, has said the vaccine shouldn't be mandated, citing, in part, the high cost of the three-shot regimen, which starts at $360.
7479	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
7480	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
7482	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.
7483	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The earlier studies indicated that widespread use of the vaccine would save money because initial investments in the cost of the vaccine would be more than recouped by a reduction in cancer treatment expenses and eventually might increase the recommended interval between Pap smears, Stanberry said.

7828	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The barrier island community of Galveston is not ready for residents to return even briefly to the city thrashed by Hurricane Ike, officials said Thursday as they pleaded for at least another week to make repairs.
7829	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Ike's death toll in the U.S. stood at 53, with 19 in Texas.
7830	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	In the Caribbean, Ike killed more than 80 people.
7831	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Many of the city's services -- including water, sewer and power -- are recovering but remain several days away from returning to full function, City Manager Steve LeBlanc said.
7832	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The only hospital on the island is getting some power, but not enough to care for the 60,000 residents of Galveston Island.
7833	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	The extra strain placed on the city by the return of residents would only slow the recovery effort, LeBlanc said.

7835	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	"We're not there yet."
7836	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Authorities let residents and business owners back onto the island briefly Tuesday to "look and leave," but quickly reversed course after the decision created traffic jams that backed up for miles Tuesday and Wednesday on Interstate 45, the only road onto the island.
7837	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Officials ruled out a resumption of that policy Thursday.

7840	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Thomas told residents that by waiting they were "making it possible for us to get you home in a week or so, instead of the months it would take if the city's infrastructure were more overwhelmed at this point."
7841	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	Roughly 15,000 residents defied forecasters' warning of "certain death" to ride out the storm on the barrier island, and many remained there despite the repeated urgings of officials -- worried about threats that include mosquito-borne disease -- to get out.
7842	APW_ENG_20080918.1157.LDC2009T13	There are clear signs of life returning to Galveston.

7897	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	But he said Washington hoped the sanctions would "result in further action by other countries, will sensitise companies that are doing business with Iran to the potential risk of doing so and the fact that by doing so they may be further advancing these proliferation activities or terrorist financing activities."
7898	AFP_ENG_20071029.0174.LDC2009T13	McCormick insisted that the sanctions were aimed at promoting a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff with Iran.

7906	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	NASSAU, Bahamas 2007-03-21 16:54:57 UTC
7907	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	DNA tests to identify the father of Anna Nicole Smith's infant daughter may not resolve legal struggles over custody of the girl, a lawyer for Smith's former partner said Wednesday.
7908	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Howard K. Stern, who has been caring for 6-month-old Dannielynn in the Bahamas, was complying with the court ordered tests, but may not relinquish custody even they prove the father is Smith's ex-boyfriend Larry Birkhead, attorney James Neavitt said.
7909	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"Howard is the legal father.
7910	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	If Mr. Birkhead's DNA matches, then he can come and say he's the biological father, and then you'll have that court battle," Neavitt told The Associated Press.
7911	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Neavitt did open the possibility of a negotiated settlement if the test proves his client is not the biological father.
7912	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	He said Stern respects Birkhead and that the two men will likely reach an agreement if the Los Angeles-based photographer is proven to be the father.
7913	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"At that point, it will be a whole different scenario, and the two guys will have to work something out," he said by phone from Los Angeles.
7914	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	"Dannielynn's interests are the most important, and Howard's been protecting her from the start."
7916	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	At the gated, waterfront home where he lived with Smith, Stern drove away with Dannielynn on Wednesday morning, then returned later without speaking to reporters.
7917	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	The paternity dispute intensified after Smith, 39, died of still- undisclosed causes in Florida on Feb. 8.
7918	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Frederic von Anhalt, the husband of Zsa Zsa Gabor, also says he may be Dannielynn's father.
7919	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Last month, he too filed legal documents seeking a DNA test.
7920	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Another contender for custody is Smith's mother Virgie Arthur, who says she could provide a more stable home than Stern and has asked the court to name her Dannielynn's guardian.
7921	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Stern has been ordered not to leave the island nation with the girl before a custody ruling.
7922	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	The girl, Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern, could inherit millions from the estate of Smith's late husband, Texas oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II.
7923	APW_ENG_20070321.1098.LDC2009T13	Smith had been fighting Marshall's family over his estimated US$500 million (euro380 million) fortune since his death in 1995.
7925	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	panic prevailed elsewhere
7929	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Similar warnings reached governments as far away as Bangladesh and Kenya, where coastal residents and tourists were ushered off beaches with megaphones and onto higher ground.
7930	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They were quite fast in delivering the warning.
7932	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"The president announced the system will be ready in 2008, but this earthquake showed it's working already."
7933	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Officials acknowledged there were glitches, with evacuations in Indonesia marked by fear and panic in some hard-hit neighborhoods.
7935	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The 2004 tsunami hit southern Thailand, including the tourist resort of Phuket, and killed more than 8,000 people.
7938	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	That disaster was marked by failure to warn many communities about the impending waves, mostly due to faulty equipment, poor communications and cumbersome bureaucracy.
7939	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It prompted the United Nations and six government donors, including the United States, to create a US$130 million (euro97 million) tsunami warning system, which is expected to be fully operational at the end next year.
7940	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Progress was initially slowed by bickering over technical problems with deep-sea monitoring buoys.
7941	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	Governments also came under fire for failing to educate citizens about the threat of tsunamis, bolster coastal infrastructure, and establishing ways to pass along warnings to remote villages.
7942	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	But in recent years, Indonesia, which was hit hardest by the 2004 disaster, has installed dozens of tidal gauges and deep-ocean tsunami monitoring buoys to detect waves as well as more than 150 seismometers to detect earthquakes.
7943	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It has vastly improved its communication network, resulting in a quake alert going out within minutes of the actual temblor.
7944	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The quake was detected on a seismograph which relays a message to the country's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency.
7945	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	It then sent a warning to hundreds of emergency management personnel in the disaster-hit regions.
7947	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	G.G. Somaratne from Payagala, a southern coastal town in Sri Lanka, said that all his neighbors were panic-stricken when the tsunami warning came.
7948	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"We took all our valuable goods to the second floor of a neighbor, carried whatever we could take and went to a relative's home some seven miles away," said Somaratne, who is still rebuilding his beachside home destroyed in 2004.
7949	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People were in temples and churches, relatives and friends, and returned after the warning was lifted, but some are still scared to come back," he said.
7950	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	In Bangladesh, volunteers with bullhorns warned villagers to evacuate to higher or inland areas, while local television and radio stations issued warnings as town halls opened control rooms to monitor the situation.
7954	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"People didn't run to the water," after the quakes, he said.
7955	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	"They got out of their houses and moved away from the water.
7956	APW_ENG_20070914.0302.LDC2009T13	The point is that people responded, which is something that wouldn't have happened two years ago."

7962	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The other half of the Nashville duo Big and Rich, the singer- songwriter has penned lyrics for a rock-infused anthem focused on the 5 1/2 years Republican presidential candidate John McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his refusal of an early release.
7963	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He stayed strong, stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out.
7965	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Its refrain: "We're all just raising McCain" -- a play on the phrase "raising Cain" that refers to causing trouble.
7968	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	He finished the song about a month ago and sent it to McCain's daughter Meghan, who sent it onto campaign officials.
7969	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"I wanted to offer him something that he didn't have, a rally song, one that really captures that maverick spirit," Rich said.
7971	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"This guy is a hero," Rich said.
7972	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"He was physically tortured for years, and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades."
7974	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	The song became an online sensation, drawing more than 8 million hits on YouTube alone.
7975	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	Rich said that while he admired Obama and was "proud as an American" that a black candidate was on the verge of winning the Democratic nomination, he disagreed with the Illinois senator on most major issues and felt he didn't have enough experience to be president.
7976	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"The entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us," Rich said.
7977	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	"National security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues.
7978	APW_ENG_20080731.1303.LDC2009T13	That's why I think John McCain is the guy to keep us safe."

7990	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	Vietnam, which has just taken its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, is seeking to strengthen its political role on the international stage.
7993	AFP_ENG_20071027.0320.LDC2009T13	But South Korea has become a leading foreign investor in Vietnam, which opened up to the world in 1986 and since then has seen speedy economic growth and international integration.
8002	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"What really annoyed me was that there was one phase in the the second half where we were in the Welsh 22 for five minutes where Jason Robinson was stood totally unmarked on the wing, 15 metres out, with the play going around him and was completely ignored," Ashton said.
8003	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"Jason on his own against three defenders, you give him the ball in that situation and I think there were two or three occasions where we did create opportunities and the communication system broke down for some reason.

8006	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	However, Ashton was adamant England hadn't simply played a 'nine- man' game against Wales.
8007	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't all that tight a game at all.
8008	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	There was a real mixture," he said.
8009	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	"In the first half I remember our backs taking their guys on in the middle of the field one-on-one and making clean line breaks which we should have finished off.

8012	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half and our kicking game came into play with our last two tries."

8018	AFP_ENG_20070805.5002.LDC2009T13	He very rarely makes mistakes, his distribution is good and he puts players through holes.

8026	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Waterwitch Looks Down, Not Up, for Drought Relief
8027	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va., farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a well.
8028	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	With his leathery hands, he gripped the handles of two L-shaped copper rods, held them parallel, tucked his elbows into his ribs, puffed out his chest, marched a few paces back and forth and silently bid the earth to reveal its watery secrets.
8029	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
8030	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``There they go!''
8031	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	said the 82-year-old grandfather and former book publisher -- and part-time water witch.
8032	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Also known as dowsers, most water witches say they are born with a capacity to locate underground water by channeling its energy, or electromagnetism, or something loopy and twitchy of that kind that has yet to be named by science, through a pair of metal rods, a forked twig, a coat hanger, a pendulum or, in rare cases, acutely alert fingers.
8033	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
8034	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	A dry spell this summer has led Maryland and Virginia to seek drought relief for farmers and could prod more homeowners to turn to dowsers to find productive wells.
8035	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But well drillers today are often uneasy with the practice.
8037	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``I've seen a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've seen 'em miss.
8038	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	And I can't say if it works.''
8039	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Some people decry dowsing as the handiwork of the devil
8040	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
8041	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Others, in the name of rational skepticism, just call it bunk.
8042	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
8043	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
8044	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
8045	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	His father preferred fresh limbs cut from a cherry or willow tree, but Shirley uses brass rods to pinpoint and drill where he believes underground streams cross -- a prime location for a multigallon-per-minute well.
8046	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	He will dowse only if clients permit, but nearly all do, said his wife, Jackie.
8047	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Detractors say there's no hard proof that the method works.
8048	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself ``strongly opposed'' to the practice.
8049	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Experiments have shown that the odds of finding water through dowsing are no better than random attempts and that rods lack special powers, said Cliff Treyens, the association's public awareness director.
8050	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
8052	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
8053	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Several dowsers who were interviewed said they work for free or charge a nominal fee.
8054	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Hydrogeologists say there is a strong chance of hitting groundwater wherever one digs.
8055	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Dowsers and their supporters say that misses the point.

8058	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The use of twigs and rods dates to biblical times, dowsers say.
8059	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Over the centuries, practitioners uttered incantations to empower rods with divine grace to seek water and other hidden substances, from precious metals to lost cats to bad vibes.

8066	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The rod doesn't find water
8067	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	the dowser does,'' said dowser Tom Stewart, 61, of North Carolina, who recently retired as a teacher and started an online business selling his homemade rods.
8068	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	John Fincham Jr., 72, of Winchester, has a penchant for his pendulum, an amethyst quartz stone hanging from a fine chain.
8069	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	By spinning clockwise for yes or counterclockwise for no, the pendulum channels a magnetism of sorts to answer questions that transcend matter, Fincham said.
8071	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Cross had called Fincham, who learned the art of dowsing at a school in Arkansas, for a second opinion about where to drill a new well.

8075	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his knack with rods, an enigma.

8093	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Indonesia is failing to protect millions of domestic workers, some as young as 12, who face long hours, potentially deadly beatings and sexual abuse, Amnesty International said in a report released Wednesday.
8094	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The estimated 2.6 million domestic workers in Indonesia are generally considered second-class citizens, the London-based rights watchdog said.
8095	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Too many women domestic workers in Indonesia ... face human rights abuses at work," said the report entitled Exploitation and abuse: the plight of women domestic workers.
8096	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Often forced to work from as young as 12 years of age, they suffer economic exploitation and poor working conditions, as well as gender-based discrimination.
8097	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Many are subjected to physical, psychological and sexual violence.
8098	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some are even killed."
8099	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	The report details cases of women and girls who were abused, raped and even beaten to death by their employers.
8100	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty said their plight often remained hidden, as they were ashamed of talking about their experiences, and the authorities and general public appeared oblivious to them.
8102	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Some 640,000 Indonesians work abroad, mostly as maids, with Malaysia one of the top destinations.
8104	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"This means they are not able to form trade unions or get any help legally."
8105	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Government moves to address the problem were falling short, the report said, "leaving millions of women vulnerable to abusive employers."
8106	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	While the government had submitted a draft law on domestic workers, it omitted basic rights given to other workers such as limits on working hours and a minimum wage, and most people were also unaware that a law on domestic violence applied to maids, Amnesty said.
8107	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"Like every other human being, domestic workers have rights -- including the right to be free from violence, the right to rest and the right to be paid an adequate wage.
8109	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	Amnesty called on the government to ensure maids received the same protection as other workers.
8110	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	"The government needs to stop viewing domestic workers as inferior and give them the same legal protections as other workers.
8111	AFP_ENG_20070214.0139.LDC2009T13	It also needs to educate police, the courts, employers and recruitment agencies on the fact that violence against domestic workers is a criminal offence," Hill said.

8258	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Many believe that spirits spend the month sniffing for souls to take, prompting the superstitious to crowd dzi-dzat stores looking for offerings to appease dead relatives.
8261	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"For some people who cannot buy the actual items, they pursue the desire in the paper-goods form," said Xin Zhao, a professor of international marketing at the University of Hawaii.
8262	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"It's like vicariously having them."
8263	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lately, Southern California Chinese have become very particular about what they take to heaven, opting for fashionable upgrades of older dzi-dzat models, funeral workers said.
8264	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Which explains the paper cell phones, paper DVD players, paper jewelry and clothing.
8265	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	It also explains why mourners purchase paper laptops: so their dead kin can keep track of the paper credit cards that came with them.
8266	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	At Lam's funeral in December, several paper cars, including a gray sedan with a red-jacketed chauffeur behind the plastic windshield, were parked on the altar amid mounds of pears, apples and pomelo.
8267	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Lam was a simple man with a gentle soul, according to his son, Konn Lam, 37.
8268	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Born in Guangzhou, China, he got married in Vietnam, raised his four children in Hong Kong and moved to Alhambra in the 1980s.
8269	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	He made some money in the import-export business but also endured some financial difficulties.
8270	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Now, Lam's family wanted to give him all the luxuries that eluded him in life.
8272	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	White flowers framed a large photo of Lam on an altar, which about 25 mourners approached with incense sticks, bowing as the sutras continued playing over speakers.
8273	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Smoke from incense sticks curled under the gold and silver paper bridges that Lam's spirit was expected to cross, near a golden servant boy and a silver servant girl.
8274	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Strips of yellow paper listing Lam's name and the date of the ceremony hung from each offering, like a letter to be sent to an afterlife address.
8275	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Outside, during the burning, two attendants chanted Lam's name after each toss, also reciting the name of the object and a short verse symbolically delivering the goods into the afterlife.
8276	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Within minutes, the intricate models settled into ash.
8277	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The mourners bowed three times toward the bin, then went back inside to finish the funeral.
8279	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A wide variety of paper goods -- kitchen utensils, trendy paper pumps -- are strung up like pinatas over spreads of candles and religious figurines.
8281	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In one corner of the Commonwealth Trading Co. in Chinatown, near a paper bathroom scale shrouded in plastic, the screen of a boxy gray paper TV with a "multi-system Penesonic" label shows a printed panorama of an Asian city.
8282	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Perched nearby, a papier-mache tabby with plastic whiskers and a lush coat of paper strips glares through beaded eyes at a paper microwave.
8284	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The paper products usually cost between $5 and $30, she said.
8285	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In the back of a dark shelf in Kwan's shop, a bulky blue paper land-line phone with a removable receiver collects dust.
8286	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	A more prominently displayed set features a sleek black cell phone with a "Moropalo" sticker that is similar to Motorola's logo.

8289	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Kwan started receiving custom requests: a paper wheelchair for someone who was disabled, paper fishing poles for an avid fly- fisher.
8290	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And, appropriately for car-crazed Los Angeles, Kwan is often asked for a specific paper Honda model with silver rims, or a BMW in a particular color.
8291	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	She usually rejects individualized requests because the range of paper materials needed to construct models is limited in the U.S., as is the pool of qualified artisans, she said.Occasionally, Kwan takes orders for specialized paper houses and contracts them out, but because each house takes 14 days to make and costs at least $500, those requests are rare.

8293	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Mourners in Asia certainly have no problem burning -- literally -- through money.
8295	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	And although China's economic renaissance has softened most regional authorities toward the ritual, burning paper replicas is still officially banned in most of the country.Communist ideology does not recognize filial piety and life after death.
8296	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The air pollution from burning paper also don't help, said Zhao, the professor.
8297	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	The Communist government has also commented on what it views as inappropriate items for burning.
8298	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Apparently the afterlife has a booming red-light district.
8299	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	In April 2006, China's deputy secretary of the Ministry of Civil Affairs prohibited the burning of "adult" items such as paper condoms, karaoke hostesses and Viagra.
8300	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	U.S. funeral directors and merchants predict the ritual is headed for a downturn, however, as the community becomes more assimilated.
8301	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	Younger, American-born Chinese avoid Kwan's shop, she said, because many do not understand the paper-burning tradition.
8303	LTW_ENG_20080215.0053.LDC2009T13	"People born here just don't believe."

8361	XIN_ENG_20081003.0110.LDC2009T13	U.S. stocks retreated Friday as investors worried about the outlook of economy despite the U.S. government's 700-billion- dollar financial rescue plan.
8362	XIN_ENG_20081003.0110.LDC2009T13	The major indexes rallied Friday morning as the markets believed the House would approve the rescue plan and the Federal Reserve could cut interest rate to boost the weak economy.

8478	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain Moves to Soften the Tone at Rallies, if Not in Ads
8480	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences with Obama.
8481	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The Republican nominee drew a cascade of boos from the crowd when he called Obama "a decent person" and told an expectant father that he does not have to be scared if he is president of the United States.
8482	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"We want to fight and I want to fight, but we will be respectful," McCain said, again prompting loud boos when he declared that he admires Obama's accomplishments.
8483	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"I want everyone to be respectful, and let's be sure we are.
8484	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... That doesn't mean you have to reduce your ferocity.
8485	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It's just got to be respectful."
8486	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At one point in the event, McCain grabbed back the microphone from an elderly woman who had begun to say that she didn't like Obama because he is an Arab.
8487	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"No, ma'am.
8488	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	No, ma'am," McCain said.
8489	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have serious differences with on fundamental questions."
8490	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was mentioned.
8491	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
8492	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I wouldn't be running."
8495	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
8496	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of that relationship."
8497	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	At the town hall, McCain promised not to relent on tying Obama to Ayers, telling the crowd, "We'll be talking about that more."
8498	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning will backfire.
8499	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"They can run misleading ads.
8500	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They can pursue the politics of anything goes.
8501	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It will not work.
8502	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Not this time," Obama said.
8503	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
8504	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses, a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and complement what has already been done for major financial institutions.
8505	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain said the federal government should suspend rules that require seniors to begin withdrawing from their retirement accounts when they reach age 70 1/2 to allow them more times to try and recoup recent losses.
8506	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But throughout the day, McCain's campaign continued to focus on Obama's character.
8509	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"ACORN is an organization that has violated the law on a repeated basis," Davis said.
8510	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
8511	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign put its accusations into a 90-second Web ad, in which an announcer accuses ACORN of "bullying banks, intimidation tactics" and "disruption of business."
8512	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It says ACORN stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to ACORN run long and deep.
8513	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... They even endorsed him for president."
8514	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama aides rejected the charge, saying that Obama was never an ACORN community organizer and represented the group only as a lawyer.
8515	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	They said his work as an organizer in 1992 was not connected to the group.
8517	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama "believes that the registration of voters at record levels is good for our democracy, and the McCain-Palin campaign's false claims are nothing more than another dishonorable, shameful attempt to divert voters' attention from the unprecedented challenges facing their families and our nation."
8518	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The voter registration group has come under increased scrutiny since its offices in Nevada were raided Tuesday morning.
8520	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Officials from ACORN brushed aside the charges of fraud, saying they attempt to verify obviously bogus information on voter registration forms that they collect.
8521	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	But, in many states the law requires them to submit forms to election officials even if they contain suspect information.

8557	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	There are some things that a girl just can't get along without on the big day.
8558	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	But even the necessities can be made nice:
8559	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Specs
8560	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Those funky, chunky black specs that define you as a cultural creative in the office might be a bit too jarring for your wedding get-up.
8561	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you need eyeglasses, are disinclined to wear contact lenses and think prenuptial vision correction surgery falls into the category of budget-buster, think about picking out some special frames for the big day.
8562	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Heidi Tanner, manager of DisRespectacles in Denver, says some women can pull off an over-the-top frame, but she typically steers brides-to-be toward frames that are "a little more minimal, softer and feminine."
8563	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Pick from a lineup of new jeweled frames, or select a vintage frame.
8564	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Among Tanner's favorites at the moment is a white Vivia frame, studded with silver sparkles, handmade in France by Francis Klein.
8565	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	They run about $515, not including lenses.
8566	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Vintage frames are less expensive, averaging around $125 in the eyeglasses store, and are way less expensive if you shop at garage sales or thrift stores.
8567	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Expect to spend about $160 for lenses.
8568	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And, yes, you do need the anti-reflective coatings -- you don't want flash photography to bounce off your glasses.
8569	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Getting your frames fit with new lenses can be done pretty quickly, but Tanner recommends getting the work done a few weeks in advance, just to be on the safe side.
8570	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Old frames can be very fragile, so if you've chosen vintage frames, select an optician who has experience with old specs and will handle your glasses with lots of TLC.
8571	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Hair
8572	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Whether you're veiling up or approaching your vows bareheaded, chances are good you'll want some kind of hair ornament, possibly including fresh blooms.
8573	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you're thinking of adding flowers to your 'do, make sure to do a trial run with the hairstylist.
8574	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If you have very short hair and don't plan to have a pro help with styling, a trial run is especially critical.
8576	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If a test run isn't in the budget, spend time going over -- in excruciating detail -- what you want from a headpiece.
8577	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Henry says she also tries to develop combs and pins that can be placed in the bride's 'do right before the ceremony or pictures.
8578	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"We try to design it in a way that can be placed on styled hair right at the end," she says.
8579	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"Freshness is always an issue when you're working in heat and sun."
8580	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Don't get hung up on a particular bloom until you talk to a florist.
8581	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	The flowers you fell in love with in pictures taken for bridal magazines might not survive in searing summer heat.
8582	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Jewelry
8583	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	So you've pored over grandma's jewelry box and picked the perfect piece to wear on your wedding day but realize that clip-on earrings make your lobes throb or the necklace dips too deeply into your d?colletage.
8584	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	What to do?
8585	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	See a custom jeweler.
8586	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Colin Miller, production manager at Master Goldsmith in Boulder, says that if your vintage piece is a good quality metal, fixing its style flaws is relatively simple.
8587	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And don't be afraid to ask for help with costume jewelry.
8588	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Some old costume pieces are very high quality, and the technology that jewelers use today -- such as laser welding tools -- make changes less risky.
8589	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Miller likes working with vintage pieces because he gets to see work from other eras and other cultures.
8590	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	He recently restored a jeweled, gold-filled locket for a client.
8591	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"It was not special in terms of materials, but it was very sentimental."
8592	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Converting clip-ons to posts starts at about $50
8593	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	completely restyling a piece can go sky high.
8594	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Miller advises not leaving the work until the last minute -- he likes to have two weeks for most projects.
8595	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Tip: Worried that your yellow gold vintage jewelry or "something borrowed" will clash with the silver beads on your dress?
8597	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	-- Shoes
8598	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	Unless you're exchanging vows on the beach, you're going to need shoes.
8599	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	And news flash, ladies, there's no reason they have to be ugly or uncomfortable.
8600	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"I tell brides all the time that it's fun to have a shoe that is not one of those dye-able, icky satin wedding shoes that are going to sit in your closet until you give them away," says Elyse Burja, who owns Strut in Denver.
8601	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	"Get a pair you love."
8602	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	For her own wedding last year, Burja wore a patent- leather- covered wedge with a snake upper in off-white.
8603	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	If she had it to do again this year, she'd pick the gold "Linda" open-toed pump from Blay.
8604	NYT_ENG_20080218.0136.LDC2009T13	When you're shopping, keep comfort in mind, she says.

8609	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	LUSAKA, May 2 (Xinhua)
8611	XIN_ENG_20070502.0244.LDC2009T13	NTAI chairperson Peter Mangani said here Wednesday the taskforce has drawn up a budget of 12 million U.S. dollars for the creation of the national capacity to respond to a possible outbreak of the disease.

8624	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The operators of a Utah mine at the center of a collapse that led to nine fatalities in August last year have been fined 1.6 million dollars, health and safety officials announced Thursday.
8625	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said the operators of the Crandall Canyon Mine had failed to report repeated collapses at the facility which meant inspectors were unable to assess practices at the facility.
8626	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Six miners were killed on August 6 when pillars propping up tunnels some 1,500 feet (450 meters) underground collapsed.
8627	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	Three rescue workers were killed 10 days later after a tunnel they were working in collapsed.
8630	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	"MSHA also found that the operator was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor.
8631	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	This dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support."
8632	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The MSHA said Genwal had been fined 1.34 million dollars for violations that directly contributed to the deaths six miners.
8633	AFP_ENG_20080724.0022.LDC2009T13	The mine operators were also hit with fines totaling 296,664 dollars for 11 non- contributory violations arising from the investigation.

8684	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	The president of the United States is arriving in a large city plaza to deliver the keynote speech in the kick-off of a groundbreaking international anti- terror summit attended by 150 world leaders.
8685	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	A teeming throng crowds the plaza: waves fly, cameras roll.

8687	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	The president approaches the podium, raising both arms in salutation and triumph.
8688	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Then: crack, a gunshot.

8690	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	The president goes down, and a bearded man in a white shirt bolts across the stage.
8691	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	A small boom, followed by mayhem.
8692	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Then a monstrous boom, followed by more mayhem, as a bomb explodes inside the plaza.
8693	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	The smoke clears to reveal a horrific expanse of blood and broken bodies, and it's clear that hundreds -- maybe thousands -- have died.
8694	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Ambulance sirens and wails of agony pierce the aftermath.
8695	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Now ask yourself: Doesn't that sound like a fun time at the multiplex?
8696	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Before you collapse from post-9/11-depressing-movie fatigue (and by the way, you really should see "In the Valley of Elah"), consider the tingles of excitement to be found in a nice, straightforward, good old-fashioned geopolitical conspiracy thriller with no pretentions.
8697	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	"Vantage Point" is nothing but a potboiler, but there is room in this world for potboilers -- especially intelligent and well-structured potboilers that grab us by the hair and send us flying.
8698	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	This is a very crafty film with a very kick-butt car chase.
8699	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	And sometimes, that's all we need from the cinema: a concentrated dose of adrenaline.
8701	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Every few scenes or so, the movie "rewinds" 21 minutes to that same, fateful noon and retells the events from a new perspective.
8702	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	In this manner it cranks through multiform points of view: television journalists covering the summit (Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana)

8707	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	and assorted terrorists.
8708	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	This could get tedious fast.
8709	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	It doesn't -- thanks to the film's airtight (or close to it) logic and attention-deficit pacing, which means that any existing plot holes whoosh past too fast to notice.
8710	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I did not feel encouraged to think while watching this movie.
8711	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I did, however, feel encouraged to gasp in amazement whenever cinematographer Amir Mokri hyper-zoomed on someone's eyeballs (they're staring
8712	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	I get it) and gasp in shock at the plot twists, some of which were stupidly and unnecessarily blown in the trailer.
8713	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Ninety percent of the movie is utterly effective, though I will admit to laughing for all the wrong reasons at Matthew Fox's character arc.
8714	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Good actor meets ill-fitting role.
8715	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	The rest of the cast acquits itself just fine in a film that doesn't allow much room for actorly flourishes.
8717	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Everyone utters every line as though the fate of the world depended on it.
8718	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	"We have to be better than this," says a politico near the end, and he says it with all due solemnity.
8719	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	But I have to disagree: they don't have to be any better than this.
8720	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	Neither does the movie.
8721	NYT_ENG_20080220.0118.LDC2009T13	For what it is, it's more than good enough.

8825	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Golf: Cabrera dreaming of Open double by by Angus MacKinnon
8830	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I know now that I can beat the best players in the world and that I can win major championships.
8831	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I feel that I could win the Open on certain golf courses and I think I have a chance to win at Carnoustie.
8832	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"That said, the course doesn't really favour me.
8833	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	It's tough and if you play badly you're going to shoot over par, and the weather conditions are going to be a factor."
8834	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Along with the enhanced belief, Romero admits he has had to deal with the enhanced expectations that go along with his new-found status.
8835	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It is a little bit hard but that is what comes with winning a major," he said.
8836	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"You have to deal with the pressure of the public, the crowds, the press and everybody."
8838	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I've had so many invitations but I've not been able to go to all of them because of my tight schedule," Cabrera revealed.
8839	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"But I will meet the President for dinner when I get back."
8840	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	When the Open was last played at Carnoustie, in 1999, the course was famously dubbed Car-nasty by some of the disgruntled players who found the thick rough virtually impossible to deal with.
8841	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	More than half the field ran up at least one round of 80 or higher and unheralded Scot Paul Lawrie finally came through the field to win the tournament with a six-over par four-round total.
8842	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	Organisers have attempted to create a fairer test this year with the rough cut back significantly and some subtle changes introduced to take some of the sting out of the holes that caused most problems last time around.
8844	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"On the (par five) sixth the lay-up area was squeezed into 12-15 yards max and remember you are hitting drive and a two iron to lay up where you would be hitting a six or seven iron for your third shot," he recalled.
8845	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"I think a few holes were definitely a little bit narrower."
8847	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"The course is in magnificent shape," he reported.
8848	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It is nothing like the course we played the last time the Open was there.
8849	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	We've got a chance of finding our ball if it goes in the rough.

8851	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	JEEP WRANGLER LESS ROUGH, STILL READY
8852	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Whether planning to drive up the beach on South Padre Island in Texas or on the red-rock trails of Utah's stunningly beautiful Arches National Park, the newest generation of the Jeep Wrangler might very well be the best way to go.
8853	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
8854	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Jeep rolled out the redesigned Wrangler, whose roots can be traced back to the military jeeps used by the U.S. armed forces during World
8855	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	War II.
8856	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	This latest version, though, is a lot more refined than even the previous model, let alone those rather crude early military models.
8857	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable doors.
8858	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Another innovation: Jeep added the first four-door version to the lineup with the redesign -- the model called the Wrangler Unlimited.
8859	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	While some Jeep purists might complain that the newest Wrangler is too gentrified for their tastes, I don't agree.
8860	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	I appreciate having a somewhat comfortable as well as ultimately capable vehicle to take me into the places most people never will see.
8861	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What's important is that the Wrangler's styling remains true to the brand, something Chrysler's designers clearly understood when they created the new generation.
8862	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler still has the signature shape, seven-slot grille, round headlights, trapezoid-shaped wheel flares, exposed door and windshield hinges, and a windshield that can be folded down.
8863	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Changes to the exterior were subtle and included a new molded front bumper with integrated fog lights and sealed headlights with 20 percent brighter halogen bulbs.
8864	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The current Wrangler is 5 inches wider than before, with a track that is 3.5 inches wider.
8865	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The extra width was added to increase interior space, but might be a problem on really narrow trails, such as the ones in Washington state that are used for the annual Cascades Jeep Jamboree.
8866	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	But for most trails, the extra width won't get in the way.
8867	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family.
8868	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The back seat is meant for just two, and there is virtually no cargo space behind the seat.
8869	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
8870	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There still is room only for four people in the two-door model, but the front seats now have 4.6 inches more hip room and 5.1 inches more shoulder room.
8871	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Rear seats have 3.9 inches of additional shoulder room, 1.6 inches more hip room and an inch more legroom.
8872	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
8873	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it -- 46.4 cubic feet.
8874	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The four-door has a 116-inch-wheelbase versus 95.4 inches for the standard-length Wrangler, and it's 20.6 inches longer.
8875	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Even with all of the changes -- including the quietest cabin ever in a Jeep -- the Wrangler still has the off-road abilities that have made the Wrangler the preferred vehicle of serious four- wheel-drive enthusiasts.
8876	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	In fact, the automaker says the new model offers even more off- road prowess than its predecessor.
8877	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The newest Wrangler has more ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems.
8878	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Also added were optional electric axle lockers and an electrically operated disconnecting sway bar.
8879	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and the Rubicon.
8880	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield combinations, Jeep said.
8881	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base price $28,190 plus $700 freight).
8882	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Ours didn't come with the optional hardtop or the glass power windows
8883	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	we had the canvas top, traditional half-doors and zip-down plastic windows.
8884	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	We didn't have the power door locks, either.
8885	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	What we did have was the Rubicon's great off-road equipment, which includes
8886	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep's Off-Road Rock-Trac transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, as well as the front and rear electronic axle lockers, the sway-bar system and 32-inch B.F. Goodrich off-road tires.
8887	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter.
8888	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Suspension improvements include advanced shock tuning.
8889	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wranglers -- both the two- and four-door models -- come with a choice of removable hard or soft tops.
8890	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Among those is a three- piece modular top, whose two front sections can be stored inside the vehicle after being removed.
8891	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A new "Sunrider" soft top includes a sunroof feature that allows it to open partially.
8892	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	It also can be removed completely to turn the vehicle into a convertible.
8893	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Powering all Wranglers is a 3.8-liter V-6 engine rated at 202 horsepower and 237 foot-pounds of torque.
8894	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, no four-cylinder is offered, which probably was a mistake considering what has happened with gasoline prices.
8895	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.
8896	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	EPA ratings are 15 miles per gallon city/19 highway with either gearbox for the four-wheel-drive models and 15/20 for the two- wheel-drive model.
8897	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	New for 2009, Hill Start Assist is standard on all 2009 Jeep Wrangler models to prevent rollback on graded surfaces.
8898	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Nine exterior colors are offered, and wheel choices include 16-, 17- and 18-inch versions.
8899	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three skid plates are included on four-wheel-drive models to protect the fuel tank, transfer case and automatic transmission oil pan from rocks and logs.
8900	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	X and Sahara four-wheel-drive models come with Jeep's second- generation Command-Trac part-time, two-speed transfer case.
8901	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	A Trac-Lok limited-slip rear differential is optional.
8902	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The only extras on our test vehicle were the automatic transmission ($825), navigation system ($1,275), trailer-towing package ($270) and "deep water blue pearl coat" paint ($225).
8903	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Total sticker price was $31,485, including freight and options.
8904	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The trailer package now includes Trailer Sway Control, which Jeep says monitors the vehicle's movement relative to the driver's intended path and activates the stability control system if the trailer begins to sway.
8905	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	IRAQ-NYT
8907	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD -- A suicide bomber detonated a car full of explosives in the historic booksellers' district of Baghdad Monday, killing at least 20 people and injuring 65 others, police officials said.
8909	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The attack in the book market raised questions about the effectiveness of the security plan, which has apparently succeeded in reducing the number of execution-style killings in the capital but not the number of car bombings.
8910	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The explosion set shops and other cars on fire, and sent deep black smoke billowing above the city.
8911	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Glass littered the roadway in the booksellers' district, known for its historic buildings including former government offices, and as the place where intellectuals once gathered in the city.
8912	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	The bomb exploded next to a printing shop, sending sheets of paper blowing into the air and littering the street with smoldering bundles of envelopes.
8913	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	Firefighters at the scene tried to get the flames under control, but the blaze flared up repeatedluy because of all the paper.
8919	NYT_ENG_20070305.0050.LDC2009T13	"The prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the incident of breaking into the security compound in Basra and stressed the need to punish those who have carried out this illegal and irresponsible act," said the full text of a statement issued late Sunday by his office.

8924	APW_ENG_20070705.0756.LDC2009T13	"It was a lady who at the end of the meal at a friend's house, and after washing the dishes ... decided to take the leftovers of the meal down to the basement to store in the deep freeze," Wilwerth said.

8937	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The maker of medical and lighting equipment said in a statement it expects to raise profitability by 7.5 percent and rearrange its units.

8941	APW_ENG_20070910.0474.LDC2009T13	The company also said it aims to deliver a minimum of 6 percent comparable annual average sales growth for the two-year period through 2010.

8948	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	The teacher, who was smiling but looked visibly tired, said she had been unaware of the media attention the case had generated, but had been horrified at the furore her innocent actions caused.

8951	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	But despite her incarceration, which she described as "terrifying", Gibbons said she bore no ill-will towards Sudan or its people -- and was sad to be leaving her class and colleagues so soon after arriving.
8952	AFP_ENG_20071204.0537.LDC2009T13	"It has been an ordeal but I was well treated in prison and everyone was very kind to me," she told reporters.

9021	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
9022	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	ATLANTA -- He was an hour outside of London when the bell began to toll.
9024	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"You need to see this," the pilot said.
9025	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
9026	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The date was July 17, 2007.
9027	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The football team on which Blank had lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as completely as any football team ever has.
9028	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season that never ended.
9029	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Every day there was another twist to the story - there was the Michael Vick story, and then there was the Bobby Petrino story.
9030	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was like someone kept adding another stick of wood to the fire."
9031	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Then, after a pause: "But fires do burn out."
9032	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	This fire, alas, had a wickedly long tail.
9033	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Within five months, Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the quarterback's singular skills.
9034	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the field," the work carries no guarantee.
9035	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
9036	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
9037	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"Clearly the answer we felt was, 'Yes.'
9038	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But whether he would have proved he could play at a very high level - a consistent level - we'll never know."
9039	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
9040	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
9041	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	But Vick never played a down for Petrino, who left under cover of darkness for Arkansas after 13 games.
9042	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6?
9043	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would the grumbling about Petrino's methods have been silenced?
9044	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It's possible, but to be frank, the issues Bobby had with the players and communication started from the very beginning.
9045	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The players from the get-go felt disconnected.
9046	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We would have had to win a lot of games for (pacification) to take place."
9047	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	For the owner, what was the nadir of the season without end?
9048	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Receiving the indictment?
9050	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Watching Vick address the media after pleading guilty?
9051	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Having Petrino bolt the day after Vick was sentenced to 23 months in jail?
9052	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It was the day (Aug. 24) we received the document," says Blank, referring to Vick's pre-plea statement of facts.
9053	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"A lot had been speculation up to then.
9054	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... Even after the indictment, Michael was still saying, 'I'm innocent
9055	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	you'll find that out.'
9056	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The reality was that what Michael had been saying was not true.
9057	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was difficult when Bobby left, but I didn't have a six-year relationship with him."
9058	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom Brady)?
9059	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What about Indianapolis (with Peyton Manning)?
9060	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	With Michael, as spectacular as he was - not always great - with that kind of exciting player, he becomes in many ways the face of the franchise."
9063	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of his reconfigured club, Blank says, "I have tremendous expectations this team will play hard and play well.
9064	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... There'll be a lot of energy, a lot of discipline.
9065	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We'll surprise a lot of people."
9066	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Already the summer has yielded one bit of cheer.
9067	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The 2008 Blank family vacation passed without untoward interruption.
9068	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"We went to Italy for 10 days," he says.

9075	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Shoreline Cruises and Capt. Richard Paris pleaded guilty to not having enough crew members aboard the Ethan Allen tour boat when it overturned during a fall foliage cruise on Oct. 2, 2005, throwing its passengers into the cold water of the Adirondack Mountain lake.
9076	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Warren County Judge John Hall fined both Paris and the company the maximum $250.
9077	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Paris also agreed to serve more than 200 hours of community service in lieu of 15 days in jail.
9078	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Paris was the only crew member aboard
9079	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	state navigation law required at least two for the 47 passengers that day.
9080	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	District Attorney Kate Hogan had said a more serious charge of criminal negligence was not supportable because there was not enough evidence to show the operators knew the boat would capsize.
9081	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Paris said he was eager to get the whole situation behind him.
9082	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	"It's over," he said outside court.
9084	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	At least nine civil lawsuits are pending over the drownings.
9085	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board believe the 40-foot (12.19 meters) boat was rocked by a wake produced by on or more passing boats.
9086	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	A grand jury heard conflicting testimony from survivors -- some said there was no wake, others said it was 6 to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters).
9087	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The federal board concluded last year that the boat was dangerously unstable and should have carried only a quarter of the passengers onboard.
9088	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The Ethan Allen was certified to carry 48 passengers plus two crew, according to weight limits that have since been modified.
9089	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	There were 48 people on the boat -- including Paris -- when it capsized, but federal investigators said the boat should not have been certified to carry that many people.
9090	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The boat's passenger capacity was calculated when it was manufactured in 1966, but modifications over the years made it less stable and its capacity should have been slashed to 14 people, the NTSB reported.
9091	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan woos young women with " cute marketing "
9093	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ayano Sasao is defying the conventional wisdom that cars targeted to a niche consumer category like young women are doomed to fail.
9095	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's so cute.
9096	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	I just love it," she said.
9097	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	To make sure women like Sasao get the message, Nissan Motor Co. launched a merchandise line for Pino, including pink bear-shaped cushions, seat covers with hearts, a CD case that looks like fat red lips, and a colorful cover for a tissue box.
9099	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	It's made by Suzuki Motor Inc.
9100	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But under a manufacturing agreement, Nissan packages Suzuki's Alto model differently, with fancier seat fabric, a distinct front design and a hubcap inspired by a snowflake so the wheels appear to sparkle on the road -- all touches to give the car that cute look.
9101	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan had 5,500 orders for the Pino in the first month since it went on sale in January, more than double the company target of 2,500 a month.
9102	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Sasao knew the Alto looked a lot like her Pino and was quite a bit cheaper.
9103	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The Pino starts at about 1 million yen (US$8,600
9104	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro6,500), while the Alto starts at 650,000 yen (US$5,600
9105	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	euro4,200).
9106	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	But she still was willing to spend more -- and take out a six-year auto loan -- for the Pino because she thought it was so much cuter.
9107	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	While models such as sportscars or family minivans target segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they usually don't sell in numbers.
9108	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Toyota Motor Corp. officials often say they don't believe in overly specific marketing tactics, which are apt to backfire for an automaker known for best-sellers like the Camry and Corolla.
9109	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	And in most countries, experts tend to advise against making autos pink or adding other "cute" features to appeal to female drivers partly because that may smack of sexism and turn off women -- except in Japan.
9110	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Here, young women are extremely powerful in setting trends, and the culture of cute is so prevalent grown men aren't embarrassed about dangling little mascots from cell phones.
9114	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Even the advertising for Pino is tailored to women who are about 20 years old.
9116	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The TV ads also tell a similar story.
9117	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan marketing manager Miwa Ishii says one goal for Pino is to court young drivers to the Nissan brand with hopes they'll move on to buy more expensive models in the future.
9118	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities -- exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.
9119	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"Rather than talk about the features of a minicar, we thought it's better to talk about how cute it is," she said.
9120	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model.
9121	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	We're starting from zero to build public awareness about it."

9129	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Secretary of the Home Ministry Umesh Mainali said the task of holding CA polls across the country at the same time would be difficult because of the insufficient number of police personnel, including Armed Police Force (APF) at the government's disposal.
9130	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Speaking at a program held in Dolakha, some 50 km east of Kathmandu, Mainali said, "With the Election Commission's (EC) repeated refusal to hold the elections, it will be very difficult for some 55,000 police and 23,000 APF to provide security at all polling booths."
9131	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Stating that it was impossible to assign three-four police personnel per polling station, Home Secretary Mainali said that it was necessary to set up temporary security outfits for the election.
9132	XIN_ENG_20070707.0141.LDC2009T13	Claiming that the Home Ministry was committed to holding timely election come what may, Mainali informed that 455 vehicles -- enough for each police post -- had already arrived and that the government will make arrangements for 10,000 communication sets.

9194	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Legislator Haim Ramon was a distant third with 8 percent, the poll of 1,000 Labor Party members showed.
9198	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Addressing supporters at Labor Party headquarters in Tel Aviv early Wednesday, Ben-Eliezer conceded defeat but said he would keep his supporters together, hinting that he would continue to challenge Mitzna's supremacy from inside the party.
9199	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	He said Mitzna called him, and Ben-Eliezer pledged the Mitzna his support in the election campaign.
9202	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``The voters are saying we want a different leadership and (Ben- Eliezer) lost because he has been a party of the leadership for the past 20 months,'' said political commentator Akiva Eldar.
9206	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``I think the outcome is excellent for the Likud,'' he said.
9207	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Weizman Shiri, a Ben-Eliezer backer, confronted leading party dove Yossi Beilin on television, accusing Beilin, a key Mitzna backer, of destroying the party by moving it to the left.
9209	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The actual vote was expected to be trickle into party headquarters in Tel Aviv in the course of the evening.
9213	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Likud leads the hawkish bloc of parties, and Labor the dovish one.
9215	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``There's no reason in the world for us to be in the Gaza Strip,'' he said in an interview Tuesday morning as he toured party branches in the Tel Aviv area.
9216	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``We will put our forces around Gaza, around the fence, protecting Israel.''
9217	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said a Gaza withdrawal wouldn't depend on negotiations with the Palestinians, but that he also intended to resume talks without conditions.
9219	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	The bearded Mitzna said that if he became convinced that no agreement with the Palestinians was possible, he would pull out unilaterally from parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
9224	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna acknowledged he might lose in January, but said his election as party leader would give Labor a stronger showing in parliament that would allow it to be a ``fighting opposition'' if it didn't win office.
9225	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Ben-Eliezer had said his appeal among more hawkish voters made him the better challenger to Likud since Mitzna would ``take us further to the left and keep us as the opposition for a long time.''
9227	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	Mitzna said he wouldn't join a new unity government under the same formula that Labor joined Likud in the past, but said he would consider a coalition if Likud accepts his positions on disengaging from the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling settlements.
9228	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	``If we can make unity around separation from the Palestinians, OK.
9229	APW_ENG_20021119.0653.LDC2007T07	But to go back to the Likud government of 2001-2002, no way in the world,'' he said.

9245	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	THIS RESEARCH IS A JOKE
9246	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don and Alleen Nilsen take humor seriously.
9247	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
9248	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They can tell you why a particular joke succeeds and why another falls flat.
9249	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take the show The Simpsons.
9250	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
9251	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Their research may seem light- hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to studying science and technology.
9252	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
9253	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Using humor can give you power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships.
9254	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	A spontaneous joke relieves tension or saves face when your presentation flops.
9255	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It also can have the opposite effect.
9256	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Tell the wrong joke and you alienate people and become a jerk.
9257	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	(More on that later, including how to keep out of trouble.)
9259	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	His students paid more attention to a funny paragraph than to a bunch of sentences.
9260	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
9261	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are both literature professors, and the study fit with their love of language.
9262	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor
9263	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
9264	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.
9265	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Instead of toiling in a lab, the Nilsens watch television sitcoms and rent DVD comedies.
9266	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are voracious readers of anything funny.
9267	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can jot down anything funny that he reads or hears.
9268	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Once a year, the couple attends an academic humor conference where about 300 academics from around the world give humor presentations.
9269	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting.
9270	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.
9271	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't stop him from trying.
9272	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and setting up the joke.
9273	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	I get it set up really well, and then I think, 'What was it about?'
9274	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	My students love to see me get caught this way."
9275	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Even though he is joke-challenged, he and his wife believe the average person can learn to be funny.
9277	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of humor.
9278	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
9279	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use," Alleen Nilsen said.
9280	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor is much broader.
9281	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	What is funny
9282	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In their research, the Nilsens have put together 11 basic types of humor.
9283	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They range from "superiority," which includes jokes that put down Congress, to "hostility," which can be perceived as hate speech, depending on the audience.
9284	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Ambiguity," in which something can be understood in two or more ways, is widely used.
9285	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck: Our business is picking up."
9286	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some humor fits into more than one category, yet nearly all jokes have common threads.
9287	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
9288	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Take this joke: "What do you give a man who has everything?
9289	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Penicillin."
9290	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It uses disease to play absurdly on words that mean an ultimate dream.
9291	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Humor pitfalls
9292	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Just as humor has common threads, humor gone awry can mean trouble.
9293	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
9294	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
9295	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.
9296	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
9297	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
9298	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
9300	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
9301	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The most successful administrators were the ones who made spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments.
9302	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	People who were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
9303	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."
9304	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One person makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the meeting.
9305	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Someone else adds a funny thought.
9306	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
9307	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"The people who laugh together bond," Alleen Nilsen said.
9308	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Making fun of one's self also is fairly safe.
9309	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."
9310	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make people aware of how important humor is in communication.
9311	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In the end, humor can help you cope with life's problems.
9312	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's like changing a diaper," Alleen Nilsen said.
9313	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's not a long-term solution, but it helps for a while."

9440	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	A twice-convicted killer with a history of violence that continued even after he was sent to death row was executed Tuesday for gunning down two video store workers during a robbery 14 years ago in Dallas.
9441	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I love all y'all.
9442	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I forgive all y'all.
9443	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	See y'all when you get there," Leon David Dorsey IV said in his final statement.
9444	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"Do what you're going to do."
9445	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey, 32, acknowledged his sister when witnesses filed in but didn't direct any comments to the relatives of his victims.
9446	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was pronounced dead nine minutes after the lethal drugs began to flow.
9447	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey was the seventh prisoner executed this year in America's most active death penalty state and the first of two inmates scheduled to die this week.
9448	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Two more are to die next week.
9449	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year upheld his conviction and death sentence and no late appeals were filed to try to block Dorsey's lethal injection.
9450	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Prison records showed that since Dorsey arrived on death row eight years ago, he's had at least 95 disciplinary cases, including a 2004 attack where he used an home-made knife to stab an officer 14 times in the back.
9452	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Less than two weeks ago, authorities recovered another shank from his cell.
9453	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	His threats of violence kept prison officials from making him available for media interviews as his execution date approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome inmates.
9454	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	But prison officials said he offered no resistance as he was led to the death chamber.
9455	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said, calling him a "true psychopath."
9456	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery, when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video store in East Dallas where they worked.
9457	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after midnight to steal $392 from a cash register.
9458	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He shot the workers when Armstrong had difficulty opening a safe at gunpoint and Lindsey tried to run.
9459	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Most of the crime was recorded on security cameras in the store.
9460	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been the gunman.
9462	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	He was in prison for that slaying when he was questioned again about the double slaying and confessed.
9463	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview from prison while he was awaiting trial.
9464	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"I've done cut folks
9465	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've done stabbed folks
9466	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've killed folks," he told The Dallas Morning News.

9468	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey at age 12 moved to Waxahachie to live with his grandparents after he was booted from Germany where his mother was stationed in the Air Force.

9471	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He'd walk down the street with a sawed-off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open -- just to see the reaction of people," Shook said.

9476	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	On a positive note, the Dodgers won't have to experience a home opener the rest of the season.
9477	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may not spare them outfielders being eaten up by the expanded, all-color advertising/scoreboard walls, or pitchers limping off the field because they didn't down enough sports drink, but at least they won't have to suffer any more ignoble openers.
9478	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kids skipped school for this.
9479	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Lawyers emptied downtown glass skyscrapers and billed phony hours for this.
9480	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	People fibbed and played hooky, and a few even legitimately took the day off for this.
9482	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	A local celebration.
9483	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers and a weekday afternoon home opener.
9484	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Only the Dodgers looked flat, lost the game 6-3 to the Rockies, lost two of their starting nine to injury and momentarily lost the momentum built after sweeping the evil Giants up north.
9485	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Hey, but it was sunny and reasonably warm and the new parking scheme didn't turn into Chavez Ravine road rage and they still served Dodger Dogs.
9486	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, on to the next one.
9487	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers never led this one, and the game was pretty much devoid of dramatics.
9488	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	They almost seemed to treat the opener as this little requirement that had to be dealt with before moving on to other things, like the other 80 home games.
9489	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There was plenty of pregame pomp and festivities, but in the end a lot of bunting left hanging around another loss.
9490	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"We're glad it's over with," said Dodgers manager Grady Little.
9491	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Mostly Little was glad the initial medical reports on outfielder Matt Kemp and right-hander Jason Schmidt were less than frightening.
9492	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Little said before the game that Kemp and Andre Ethier were not in an official platoon in right field, but in competition for the full-time job.
9493	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Some competitions last longer than others.
9494	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp has been off to a solid start, but in the fourth inning he chased a drive by Jeff Baker to the wall in right.
9495	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The drive hit the wall at about the same time as Kemp.
9496	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	This is a new wall, one that oddly doubles as a scoreboard, or streamlined video board.
9497	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The video board is about double the size of last season's out-of- town scoreboard.
9498	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's filled with stats and advertising, like the promise of "Oceans 13" coming June 8, or about the time I normally write off the Dodgers.
9499	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It's covered in plexiglass, which supposedly gives, but apparently not too much.
9500	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit an area that would have been padded last year -- the padding added years ago after Darryl Strawberry separated his shoulder crashing into the wall.
9501	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I got hops like Jordan, I jumped so high," Kemp said.
9502	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp hit the video wall with his right shoulder and fell in a clump.
9503	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Pain flashed through his shoulder and he feared serious injury.
9504	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"At first I thought it was worse than it was," he said.
9505	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Kemp left the game and was taken to a local hospital for X-rays.
9506	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Seasons had gotten off to better starts.
9507	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	New Dodgers trainer, and former Giants trainer, Stan "No Relation" Conte said X-rays were negative, revealing no fractures or apparent dislocation, but more would be known today.
9508	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodgers veteran second baseman Jeff Kent remained understandably skeptical about the logic of a video-board outfield wall.
9509	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about that," Kent said.
9510	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"Plexiglass?
9511	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	That may have to go.
9512	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"I don't think guys are going to want to climb that."
9513	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Then in the top of the fifth, Nomar Garciaparra bobbled a Kazuo Matsui grounder for an error.
9514	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, covering first, immediately grabbed the back of his right hamstring after hitting the bag.
9515	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Dodger hearts dropped.
9516	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, the Dodgers' $47 million offseason acquisition, also left the game, though Conte later said the right-hander was simply dehydrated and cramped.
9517	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt is expected to make his next start.
9518	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	"He'll be fine," Little said.
9519	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Schmidt both allowed and received his first Dodger home runs in the opener.
9520	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	He gave up a first-inning home run to Garrett Atkins, but then provided the Dodgers with their only power of the day, hitting a solo shot off Jeff Francis in the third.
9521	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	It was that kind of goofy, not-quite-together opener.
9522	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Things got off to a less than auspicious start when the two F-16s from Edwards Air Force Base that were supposed to fly over as the climax of the opening ceremony flew over Dodger Stadium before the anthem was even sung.
9523	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers took the field with Wilson Valdez at shortstop for the injured Rafael Furcal and Ramon Martinez at third for Wilson Betemit.
9524	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Betemit is healthy but erratic, and that Dodgers commitment to him at third lasted a whole five games.
9525	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	There were several small moments to make the Dodger faithful nervous -- Juan Pierre unable to throw a runner out at the plate on a ball so shallow Kent almost could have gotten there

9530	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	Still, it was one game.
9531	NYT_ENG_20070410.0048.LDC2009T13	The Dodgers had also lost their season opener at Milwaukee.

9546	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	When it comes to supplying the United States with oil, Africa is quietly trumping the Middle East.
9547	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	U.S. crude oil imports from Africa topped supplies from the Middle East in 2006 for the first time in 21 years, recent government data show.
9548	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent, or 1.3 million barrels a day.
9549	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Now, the fractional edge given to African crude oil suppliers underscores a number of market changes and may grow wider in coming years.
9550	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Surging growth from Asia -- led by China, where oil demand is expected to grow 6.2 percent this year -- is drawing huge volumes of Middle East crude.

9552	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude supplies from Africa and the Middle East each accounted for a 22 percent share of U.S. crude imports, but in actual physical supplies, Africa's flow topped the Middle East by 8,000 barrels a day.
9553	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Crude from Africa, at 2.23 million barrels a day, was the highest since 1979 and a 4.8 percent jump from 2005.
9554	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The 22 percent share -- the biggest in 25 years -- compares with 21 percent last year and a share of less than 13 percent in 2002.

9556	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The flow of Middle East crude into the United States was at the lowest level since 1998 and the 22 percent share is the slimmest since 1997.
9558	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Major producers such as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil exporter -- and other Middle East producers have targeted more volumes to China and India, where they've also built joint ventures to sell petroleum products.
9559	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia saw its third straight decline in crude supply to the U.S. market, with a 1.7 percent dip to 1.42 million barrels a day, the lowest volume since 1999.

9574	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu has killed a man in northern Vietnam in the country's second death from the illness this year, and health officials warned Thursday that the virus could spread further.
9576	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The man's test results came back positive Sunday for the dangerous H5N1 virus strain.
9577	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	He was the 49th person to die of the virus in Vietnam since bird flu began raging across Asia in late 2003.
9580	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	"The danger of the bird flu virus spreading further remains very high," Nga said "We have repeatedly urged people to report sick poultry to animal health authorities and to refrain from eating sick birds."
9581	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Dong Van Chuc, director of the Department of Animal Health in Hai Duong, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Hanoi, said nine of the man's 12 fighting cocks had died since late January.
9582	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Chuc said the man's wife cooked the dead chickens and shared them with a relative, then cremated the three sick birds, meaning that animal health officials could not test any of their flock for the bird flu virus.
9583	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	No members of the man's family have fallen ill, but health authorities were testing them and close neighbors for the virus, Chuc said.
9584	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	Bird flu remains hard for people to catch, but health experts worry the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily among humans, sparking a pandemic.
9585	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	So far, most human cases have been linked to contact with infected birds.
9586	APW_ENG_20080214.0227.LDC2009T13	The World Health Organization says at least 226 people have died worldwide from the virus.

9625	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The government will provide a public subsidy of 30 sen (9 cents) per liter of gasoline to keep the retail price lower than the market rate, Abdullah also said.

9627	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The new mechanism comes after the government hiked gasoline prices by 41 percent in June to curb a runaway subsidy bill.
9628	APW_ENG_20080801.0492.LDC2009T13	The increase caused year-on-year inflation to spiral to 7.7 percent that month -- the steepest rate in more than 27 years.

9652	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua)
9653	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Two suspects were arrested for their alleged involvement in two arson cases in the recent Lhasa riots which led to the deaths of two innocent victims, China's Ministry of Public Security said here on Tuesday.
9654	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The two men, both 27 years old, are named Tanzen and Losang Gyaltsen, respectively, according to a report from the Tibet Autonomous Region public security bureau.
9656	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Around 2 p.m. on March 14, Tanzen allegedly participated in such criminal activities as randomly assaulting passersby, vandalizing properties, looting and arson in the neighborhood of Duosengge Road in the Tibetan capital.
9657	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He set fire to several shops and used a lighter to burn pants in a garment store named Playboy.
9659	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	On the same day, Losang Gyaltsen set fire to a pants store called Hongyu on the Youth Road in Lhasa.
9661	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Losang Gyaltsen also collaborated with others in looting and burning an outlet of the garment brand Metersbonwe and a Snow Spider shoe store.
9662	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Wu said an investigation of the two was still underway.
9663	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The ministry has now made public four deadly arson cases -- those in a Yishion outlet, a motorcycle shop, the Playboy garment store and the Hongyu pants store -- that led to the deaths of 12 civilians.
9664	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	According to the ministry spokesman, apart from the cases already known to the public, six more people were found to have been killed in the March 14 riots.
9665	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	They are:
9666	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He Jianshu, male, 60, Han ethnic group, from the southwest Sichuan Province
9667	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Lhapa Tsering, male, 30, Tibetan ethnic group, from Lhasa, Tibet.
9668	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Wangdu Dargye, male, 24, Tibetan ethnic group, from Damxung County of Lhasa, Tibet.
9669	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	A male surnamed Gao, 30, Han ethnic group, from the northwest Gansu Province.
9670	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Another two males killed in the riots have not yet been identified.
9671	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Local police were making further investigations, Wu said.
9672	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	To date, the deadly riot has claimed the lives of 18 civilians and one police officer.
9673	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
9674	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
9675	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He said that police have captured the primary suspects who allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on March 14 in Lhasa.
9676	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	"The suspects are closely connected with the Dalai clique," he said.
9677	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique, Wu revealed.

9685	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	He was released in the afternoon but Hua Huiqi was still at an undisclosed location, he said.
9686	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"I told him not to go because it's during the Olympic Games and this period is sensitive," Hua Huilin told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
9687	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"But he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized.
9688	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	So I went with him hoping to protect him."
9689	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The line was disconnected three times during Hua's conversation, a sign that authorities were monitoring the telephone.
9690	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huiqi had been planning for days to be at the church at the same time as Bush, but it was not immediately clear what he was going to do.
9693	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	China allows worship only in officially approved churches such as the one Bush visited Sunday with first lady Laura Bush, so millions of people pray privately in house churches to avoid detection.
9694	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	After attending the service, Bush gathered for photos with parishioners on the front steps.
9695	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"It just goes to show that God is universal," Bush said.
9696	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	"No state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion" -- a reference to China's tight control of churches.
9697	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	It was not clear if Bush was aware of Hua's situation.
9699	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Photos on the group's Web site show a woman identified as Padma- Dolma being dragged on the ground as police and plainclothes agents try to wrest the flag away from her.
9700	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Shortly after, three other activists tried to unveil a banner that said "Tibetans are dying for freedom" but were stopped by authorities, the group said.
9701	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	All five protesters -- including two Americans and two Canadians -- belong to the New York-based group.

9705	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	The demonstration lasted about five minutes and all five were led away, the group said.
9706	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	It was the latest in string of similar protests in the past week as Beijing became a focus of international attention because of the games, which opened Friday.

9714	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups say that charge stemmed from an incident in which Hua and his mother scuffled with police as they prepared to deliver a petition to the central government over the demolition of their home in 2001.

9731	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	EAST MONTPELIER, Vt.
9732	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Hundreds of gallons of groundwater flow to the surface in rivulets here each hour, helping to create this town's signature spring, a lush current typical of northern New England.
9734	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The idea makes his neighbors nervous.
9735	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Like two-thirds of Vermonters and 40 percent of New Englanders, most residents of East Montpelier depend on wells.
9736	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Some worry that a water-bottling operation will compromise their ability to shower and flush
9737	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	others just do not want their local water sold elsewhere.
9738	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In corners of the state, once-reliable well-water supplies have become intermittent in recent years, with homeowners blaming local developers or mining operations or a bottling operation.
9739	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In March, the town of East Montpelier postponed any bottling for three years.
9740	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Three months later, in a move that put Vermont in the company of a growing number of states, the legislature adopted a law making its groundwater a public trust.
9741	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Beginning in 2010, anyone seeking to pump more than 57,600 gallons a day will need a permit, with exceptions for farming operations, water utilities, fire districts and some geothermal systems.
9742	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Groundwater worries, long commonplace in the arid West, have spread to the country's wettest areas (and few could be wetter than Vermont this summer).
9743	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In recent years, eastern aquifers have been drawn down in areas around Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as Atlanta.
9744	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Water had to be trucked into Montgomery, a town in northern Vermont, last summer during a drought.
9746	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The amount of water that we use will increase and we will be looking for fresh water in many places."
9747	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	With the growing recognition that groundwater is not limitless, more states and localities are looking for ways to protect it.
9750	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"Public policy makers are wrestling with legal systems designed in an era of abundance," said Andy Buchsbaum,director of the Great Lakes office of the National Wildlife Federation.
9751	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"They were not designed to address shortages."
9753	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	We make the assumption that just because you get so many gallons out of a well now, you will forever."
9755	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
9756	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.
9759	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is now a sense that groundwater is finite and needs to be protected."
9760	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In the past decade, commercial and industrial users, including golf courses, mining operations and, most notably, water bottlers, have faced increasing local opposition in damp regions from Maine to Wisconsin.
9762	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There was a recognition by people that something was going to pass," he said.
9763	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"The desire by the business community was to play an active role and shape it as we were able."
9764	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Early opponents, like farmers, mostly stayed on the sidelines when their water uses were grandfathered under the law.
9765	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Surface water in streams, lakes and rivers, has been legally managed for hundreds of years.
9766	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	But groundwater, until recent years, was often treated as something separate, hydrologically and legally.
9767	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Both distinctions are now breaking down.
9768	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."
9769	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Replenishment from rain or surface water, or "recharge" as the experts term it, tends to be gradual.
9770	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Extraction of ground water tends to alter natural flow patterns and speeds, the report said.
9772	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Mapping a Vermont aquifer and measuring its contents is thus akin to tracing a Jackson Pollock painting -- there are numerous units, of irregular dimensions, to delineate.
9773	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	While some residents of East Montpelier worry that their wells may suffer if Antonovich's firm, Montpelier Springs Water Co., opens for business, Antonovich said that he has had the aquifer mapped and that there is more than enough water for all.
9774	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, he keeps cordial relations with those who oppose him, said Carolyn Shapiro, one of a group of Antonovich's neighbors who pushed for the moratorium.
9775	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Antonovich, a New York-area furrier who has been vacationing in Vermont for half a century, said he did not plan to contest the moratorium.
9776	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also typified the debate over the public-trust law.
9777	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Jon Groveman of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, one of the bill's architects, drew praise not only from its legislative sponsors but also from MacLean, who represented the golf course and bottled-water industries.
9778	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The law, Lyons said, commanded such broad support in part because it calls for mapping and monitoring, not increased regulation.
9779	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"It is a beginning," she said.
9780	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum said he believes that the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis, or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that the West is now," he said.
9781	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	"There is no water and they're trying to apportion droplets.
9782	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	They're in the terrible position of trying to judge between needs that are all critical with not enough resources."
9783	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum added, "We have the chance to get ahead of it."

9849	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	FED, STILL WARY ON INFLATION, LEAVES A KEY RATE UNCHANGED
9850	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
9851	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time.
9852	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
9853	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."
9854	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory.
9855	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated," the central bank said.
9856	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The biggest question was how policymakers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
9857	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	For the past several years, Fed governors including Ben S. Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the "core" rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to 2 percent a year.
9858	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
9859	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
9860	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Fed policymakers are in no rush to reduce interest rates.
9861	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this year.
9862	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the past several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.
9863	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
9864	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	`Religious Enlightenment' Part of Detainee Reeducation Effort
9866	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said such efforts, aimed mainly at Iraqis who have been held for more than a year, are intended to "bend them back to our will" and are part of waging war in what he called "the battlefield of the mind."
9867	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Most of the younger detainees are held in a facility that the military calls the "House of Wisdom."
9868	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The religious courses are led by Muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine," Stone said, according to the transcript of a conference call he held from Baghdad with a group of defense bloggers.
9869	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Such schooling "tears apart" the arguments of al-Qaida, such as "Let's kill innocents" and helps to "bring some of the edge off" the detainees, he said.
9870	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	As a result of the increased U.S. troop presence in Iraq this year, the number of Iraqis in U.S. detention has swelled from about 10,000 last year to more than 25,000.
9871	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The effort to reshape attitudes among the growing detainee population is aimed at addressing a problem that has vexed U.S. troops in Iraq for the past four years: Military detention facilities have served as breeding grounds for extremist views, transforming some prisoners into hard-core insurgents, according to military analysts.
9872	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
9873	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and interrogators help distinguish the extremists from others, he said.
9874	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some detainees are recommended for release.
9875	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If a detainee is an imperative security risk ... then I'm going to reduce that risk and I'm going to replace that destructive ideology," he said.
9876	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"And then when he's assessed to no longer be a threat, I'm going to release the detainee being less likely to be a recidivist."
9877	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Since May, Stone said, he has released about 2,000 detainees "and we've not had any coming back."
9878	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his goal is to keep those who are released from harming U.S. troops or anyone else.
9879	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"They're not going out of here unless I can feel comfortable about that," Stone added.
9880	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not doing mass releases."
9881	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other initiatives at the facilities include vocational training and basic education programs for about 7,000 detainees.
9882	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he believes his approach is "compelling because it's how you win this war, not only the one in Iraq, but the one on a greater basis."
9884	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The 25,000 detainees now being held in U.S. facilities in Iraq include more than 820 juveniles, Stone said, most of whom are held in the House of Wisdom, which opened last month and is located at the Camp Victory military base near Baghdad's airport.
9885	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said that six additional young people had been sent to him just Tuesday, and that "the trend is towards the youth," including 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds.
9887	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said that youths grow up to become insurgents by starting out as messengers, guards and even planters of makeshift bombs.
9888	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said his staff members include a specialist in Islamic youth programs and he has also put together "a positive program that has been proven in Islam to actually turn the kids around to sort of reject some of these other things."
9889	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone, who speaks Arabic and said he reads the Koran daily, noted that his facilities have 30 classrooms staffed with teachers and counselors.
9890	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also started "four very large soccer programs" aimed at young detainees.

9892	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I want to know who they are," he said.
9893	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"They're like rotten eggs, you know, hiding in the Easter basket."
9895	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We were trying to figure out if they're messing with us.
9896	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	... You're not talking about radicals going to choirboys."
9897	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	But he also added that they're succeeding in countering extremists in the facilities.
9898	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We're busting them down, we're making whole moderate compounds that didn't exist before."
9899	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone described a sort of religious insurgency that occurred at one detention facility on Sept. 2.
9900	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"We had a compound of moderates for the first time overtake ... extremists.

9907	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he has created a "transition-out barracks" where detainees being released discuss civics and human rights.
9908	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He has also begun a "huge, expensive" Rand Corp. research study on detainee motivation and morale and has plans for a major communication campaign.
9909	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	He said he also wants to provide jobs for released detainees.
9910	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"I'm not naive," Stone said.

9918	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	Her shocking death threw the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic nation into chaos, sparking violence and leading to months of political turmoil that ended in September when her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, claimed the presidency.
9919	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"In the tradition of a true Bhutto, she faced certain death rather than abandon her principles or the people," Zardari said in a message to the nation to mark the anniversary.
9920	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	"The tyrants and the killers have killed her but they shall never be able to kill her ideas, which drove and inspired a generation to lofty aims," he said, adding that democracy was the only way to fight militancy.
9921	AFP_ENG_20081227.0336.LDC2009T13	The masses travelled by train, bus, truck, car, bicycle and even on foot to mourn the charismatic, Oxford-educated Bhutto, the first woman to lead a Muslim nation who was hailed in the West as a face of moderation.

9943	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	China has investigated more than 6,660 government officials derelict of their duties for the past 19 months, said deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Wang Zhenchuan Wednesday here.
9945	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	But he did not disclose the number of government officials convicted of duty dereliction after being investigated.
9946	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	The duty dereliction investigation has been focused on government officials and staff of justice department who have misused their power for private gains, and on officials who have neglected their duty causing major economic losses for the government.
9947	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	"The investigation has helped maintain market order, secure judicial justice and regulate use of government power," Wang said.
9948	XIN_ENG_20070228.0021.LDC2009T13	He said that in 2007 the procuratorates will continue to focus on investigation of cases in which judicial justice is hampered and environment damaged due to official's dereliction of duty.

10066	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi led the charge to revamp the sport's traditional 10-point scale to an open-ended scoring system, which is supposed to give a truer representation of routine's value.
10067	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The system has been in use since the beginning of 2006, and will get its biggest test at the Beijing Olympics next year.
10068	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The change came after a series of judging errors at the Athens Olympics, most notably the debacle involving all-around champion Paul Hamm.
10070	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Yang finished third, 0.049 points behind Hamm.
10071	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi's suggestion that Hamm share his gold medal fueled protests by the South Koreans that forced the American to defend himself all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
10072	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Hamm eventually was declared the rightful winner, and Grandi said again Monday he agreed with that decision.
10073	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"Paul Hamm is the Olympic champion without any ifs or buts," Grandi said.
10074	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	But the Hamm incident wasn't the only reason gymnastics had to change its rules, Grandi said.
10075	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	There also were problems with the men's high bar and vault competitions in Athens.
10076	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Grandi also expressed concern that some don't fully understand the new points system, wrongly believing that more difficult routines are rewarded even if performed incorrectly.
10077	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"The big problem we're having lately is that we have to penalize very strongly execution mistakes or lack of artistry," he said.
10078	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"This is the big philosophy I want to get through.
10079	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	You should win if you have high difficulty, but only if it is executed perfectly.
10080	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	If not, the deductions should be so strong that it's worse to do the more difficult thing."
10081	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	Execution penalties are already higher than under the old system -- eight-tenths of a point, compared to a half-point -- but Grandi said he'd like to see them doubled.
10082	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	The federation has also held classes to make sure judges understand the new rules, and is using video replay so judges can review routines.
10083	APW_ENG_20070521.1439.LDC2009T13	"I intend for the Olympic Games to make sure the judges will apply the rules correctly," Grandi said.

10087	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain focusing on Iowa despite polls
10089	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
10090	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrats counter that McCain's event Tuesday in Des Moines shows he cannot be elected president without winning in states where he trails his rival.
10091	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Republicans acknowledge that McCain is behind, but say the race is closer than the polling indicates.
10093	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	A Des Moines Register poll conducted Sept. 8-10 showed Obama ahead, 52 percent to 40 percent, while a Big Ten Battleground Poll a few days later, conducted Sept. 14-17, found the rivals tied at 45 percent.
10094	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks.
10095	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He held a small-business round-table in Des Moines, following up on a Sept. 18 stop in Cedar Rapids with running mate Sarah Palin.
10096	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	His campaign also has continued television advertising in the state at roughly the same level as Obama.
10098	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	That Republican optimism comes despite voter registration trends that show Democrats have gained a more than a 100,000-person edge in Iowa.
10099	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Still, the last two presidential elections were decided by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point.
10101	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
10102	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"They still have the time, they still have the money.
10103	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	It's too early for them to bail out of Iowa," he said, noting the fairly cheap cost of advertising here.
10105	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I have never seen an election that has had this many violent mood swings," he said.
10106	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Six months ago we were talking about Iraq, two months ago we were talking about flooding and now we're talking about federalizing the financial system."
10107	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain used the roundtable discussion to issue his latest call for dealing with the U.S. financial crisis, saying he spoke earlier in the day with Bush and urged action.
10108	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He asked Treasury Department officials to use their stabilization funds to shore up money market accounts, and to purchase mortgages.
10109	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Housing and mortgages are at the root of this crisis," McCain said.
10110	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I urge Treasury to take action to shore up mortgage values."
10111	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain aides say Iowa has made the list of competitive states he is focusing on.
10112	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Iowa has seven electoral votes
10113	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	it takes 270 decided in state-by-state contests to win the presidency.
10114	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"John McCain views Iowa as a key battleground," said spokeswoman Wendy Riemann.
10115	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"He intends to fight here until Nov. 4."
10116	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Obama aides read something else into McCain's focus and argued it was simply electoral math.
10117	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"It's pretty clear John McCain believes he needs Iowa to win," said spokesman Brad Anderson.
10119	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	He said Obama's operation was "the best presidential organization in the history of Iowa" and noted that McCain is only now creating one.
10120	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"You can't catch up," Crawford said.
10121	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, said McCain's problem in Iowa has less to do with organization than where he is on the issues, such as a new farm bill and incentives for alternative fuels.
10122	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Both are popular throughout the Midwest, and McCain opposed both.
10123	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I think he has a lot of explaining to do," Culver said.
10124	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I don't think the farmers and rural Iowa in particular are going to forgive him."

10133	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	By Tuesday, the official Xinhua news agency said the death toll had risen to 20 with another 1,520 children infected.
10134	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All those infected were reportedly below the age of six, with the majority of them just two years old.
10135	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	All kindergartens in the city were closed on Tuesday, Xinhua said, as authorities scrambled to contain the virus nearly two months after the first signs of potential major problems.
10136	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Hospitals in Fuyang city in Anhui started to admit children in early March with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers or rashes on their hands and feet, all symptoms of the virus, Xinhua said.
10137	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	EV71, which causes hand, foot and mouth disease, is very contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or faeces of an infected person.
10138	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Young children are most susceptible because of lower immune systems.
10139	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	However Xinhua quoted an infectious disease specialist as saying that there was no need for panic with the latest outbreak, and that most of the children would recover.
10140	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"An overwhelming majority of the patients are curable," said Li Xingwang, who is in charge of the expert panel for prevention and treatment of the virus.
10141	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"Most of the children could recover after a week's treatment."
10142	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	In its article, the China Youth Daily said that far scarier than the actual epidemic was the local government's initial denial of rumours about the disease.
10143	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"When the terrifying virus had already infected more than 10 unrelated children, the local government denied the rumour," it said.
10144	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	A local official denied there was any cover-up at his level, saying the incident had been reported to higher authorities.
10146	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"This is a new case, time is needed to find out the cause and what virus it is.
10147	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	And we can only make it public when we are ordered to."
10148	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	Another newspaper on Tuesday raised cover-up allegations, referring to a similar incident in the same city four years ago, when authorities sought to hide a scandal over low-quality milk powder that killed at least 12 babies.
10149	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	"What have Fuyang officials amended in the past four years?"
10150	AFP_ENG_20080429.0359.LDC2009T13	a comment piece in the Beijing News asked.

10154	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Football: Win over Fiorentina puts Bayern on the brink
10155	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern Munich ignored their poor league form to secure a convincing 3-0 win over Fiorentina in Tuesday's Champions League match in Munich to take control of Group F.
10157	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Despite a dramatic slump in recent weeks which has seen them crash to 11th in the Bundesliga, Bayern forgot their domestic league form to take another three points in the quest to add to their 2001 Champions League crown.
10158	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	The victory will take some of the pressure off Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann who picked up his first win of October last weekend -- his first in four league games -- as Munich's fortunes look to be improving.
10159	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	With two wins and a draw under their belt in Group F, Bayern are now on the verge of making the first knock-out phase with seven points from Lyon second on five.
10160	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But the result leaves Fiorentina in a precarious position -- especially after Lyon's 5-3 win at Steaua Bucharest -- at third in the table.
10161	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Bayern had a dream start when Luca Toni brushed off a rib injury to face his former club and flicked the ball into the path of Miroslav Klose who out-paced the defence to drill the ball into the corner after just four minutes.
10163	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	Having scored 31 league goals for La Viola in the 2005/06 season, Toni is still a firm favourite amongst Fiorentina fans despite playing for Bayern and received a warm response when he was replaced on 57 minutes.
10165	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But Cesare Prandelli's team will leave Munich disappointed they did not finish their chances having had some 23 shots on goal, compared to Bayern's 15, but were constantly frustrated by Bayern's defence.
10167	AFP_ENG_20081021.0075.LDC2009T13	But with three games left for both teams there is still all to play for in the return leg on November 5 when the two sides meet at Fiorentina's Artemio Franchi stadium.
10169	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:
10171	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	No matter that the law has helped boost student learning and narrow the achievement gap, that schools are more accountable, and that students who go to failing schools now have options.
10172	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Not even the threatened loss of millions of dollars in federal education aid seems to worry lawmakers more intent on making political points than good public policy.
10173	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Both the House and Senate passed bills that would drop Virginia from the federal education program unless the U.S. Education Department waives some requirements.
10174	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The legislation directs the state Board of Education to come up with a plan for withdrawal, with one version even setting a deadline of June 30, 2009.
10175	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Del.
10176	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	R. Steven Landes, R-Augusta, a sponsor of the House bill, said that he hopes to clarify it so that the legislature would have to act again to sign off on any withdrawal.
10177	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The bills are in conference, where one hopes that they will die as the legislature rushes to adjourn.
10178	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, D, has said he won't support the measure, and the state board, while wanting more flexibility, doesn't favor a state withdrawal.
10179	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	They undoubtedly are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300 million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be tolerated.
10180	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the bills passed by overwhelming margins, a product of Republicans averse to f!
10181	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	ederal involvement and Democrats mindful of teachers unions' opposition to No Child Left Behind.
10182	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The result could produce the dubious distinction of Virginia becoming the first state to try to opt out of the landmark bill.
10184	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Most notable was its ill-advised rebellion over the testing of children with limited proficiency in English.
10185	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The state eventually backed down in the face of a loss of federal funds, but the reluctance to hold all students to the same standards says much about why No Child Left Behind is needed.
10187	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Until No Child Left Behind came along, school districts were able to mask the low achievement of poor and minority students, there was no recourse for parents and children in failing schools, and no one was held accountable.
10188	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	In passing the measures, lawmakers talked about sending a message to Washington.
10189	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Too bad it's one that ignores the interests of children.

10201	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	Norway said Tuesday it would donate 130 million kroner (17 million euros, 24 million dollars) to help protect the Amazon rain forest, the deforestation of which is leading to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
10203	AFP_ENG_20071030.0153.LDC2009T13	"The felling and burning of tropical forests is a significant cause of greenhouse gases," Solheim said in a statement.

10244	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war," Obama said in a statement issued by his campaign.
10247	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	The two responses to an incident unfolding in real time and delivered in the midst of the political calculations of a presidential campaign were indicators of how McCain and Obama might respond to a crisis with international implications.
10250	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Saakashvili has been criticized for cracking down on demonstrators last year, but McCain has been a loyal and longtime ally.
10251	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	McCain first heard about the crisis shortly before leaving Cincinnati for Des Moines on Friday morning, and to gather more information he made phone calls from his car on the way to the airport.
10253	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Scheunemann, who has worked for McCain's campaign since early 2007, took a leave from his firm, Orion Strategies LLC, in March of this year.
10254	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	After talking with his aides, McCain worked on his campaign plane with Mark Salter, one of his closest advisers, on the wording of the statement.
10255	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	He delivered it on the tarmac upon landing in Des Moines.
10256	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama's response came in several stages.
10258	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Obama was more judgmental in his own statement later on Friday, and by Saturday his campaign stepped up the rhetoric once again.
10260	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"Clearly Russia bears the responsibility for that escalation."
10261	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Aides said Obama was also briefed by Hadley on Friday and was kept informed on developments by his foreign policy advisers as he flew to Hawaii.

10268	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter, of the McCain campaign, dismissed the criticism.
10269	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	"In the middle of an international crisis, in which people are getting killed, the best the Obama campaign can come up with is to cast aspersions on a McCain staffer," he said.
10270	NYT_ENG_20080809.0130.LDC2009T13	Salter acknowledged that Scheunemann had lobbied for Georgia, but said that McCain "has been involved in the efforts of former Soviet Republics to embrace democracy and free-market values since the end of the Cold War."

10444	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"Juan Martin had a slight preference to play second," Mancini said.
10445	APW_ENG_20081120.1121.LDC2009T13	"And the fact that David is first is good because he has more experience."

10520	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Early in the morning, a crowd of journalists assembled outside the parliament building, waiting for parliamentarians to show up for the planned session.

10534	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal said he is under no pressure when he plays, but knows that his charmed life cannot go on forever.

10637	AFP_ENG_20070415.0098.LDC2009T13	As the communist state celebrated the 95th birth anniversary of its founder Kim Il-Sung, diplomats involved in disarmament efforts said they would give it more time to shut down its nuclear reactor.

10779	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground.
10780	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	However, the skeleton was left undisturbed because the country was then at war, according to the museum's Web site.
10781	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers finally returned to the site in 1967, but the exposed parts of the skeleton had been scattered or lost.
10782	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Only the skull and upper jaw parts were left to be excavated, but it was not until recently that the museum could afford to get the bones dated, Narita said.

10804	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We've been actively considering ideas on how we might establish some form of incubator complex."
10805	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Others are using a different strategy.
10806	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans Wednesday to say it has struck an unusual deal with Harvard University to fund research projects related to cancer, infectious diseases, and other areas Vertex is interested in - with few strings attached.
10807	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The Cambridge biotech company said Harvard researchers will be able to publish their results freely and retain the rights to any technology they develop - something barred by some corporate research funders.
10809	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a total of several million dollars over three years.
10810	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	If Harvard decides to license any technology developed, Vertex said it has the option to license it first.
10811	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It's a new model," Boger said.
10812	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Fuchs said Biogen Idec hopes to house up to four or five companies in its biotech incubator within two years.
10813	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
10814	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone biology and metabolism.
10815	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The company hopes to pioneer new treatments for patients suffering from type 2 diabetes and obesity, which have been on the increase in the United States.
10816	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Fuchs said Biogen Idec plans to give each company in its incubator between $3 million and $10 million in seed funding over several years, dedicated office and laboratory space, administrative support, and technical expertise.
10817	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In return, Biogen Idec will receive stock in the companies and an option to eventually buy the rest at a prenegotiated price.
10818	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Two local venture capitalists were enthusiastic about Biogen Idec's endeavor.
10819	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"I'm a big fan of what they are doing," said Terry McGuire, managing general partner of Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham.
10820	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"There's always a shortage of capital for the early stage stuff."
10821	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Peter Feinstein, general partner of BioVentures Investors in Cambridge, said he thought Biogen Idec could help invigorate its research programs by bringing in entrepreneurs with new ideas.
10822	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"It like having puppies around an older dog," Feinstein said.
10823	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Walts, however, said one concern with a corporate incubator is that it could hurt start-ups' ability to work with other drug companies.
10824	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	So, he said, Genzyme is considering setting up a "virtual incubator" instead.
10825	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Genzyme would provide seed funding and technical support to new ventures, but would not physically house the companies on its property.
10826	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	That way, the companies might be better able to forge their own identities.
10827	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Regardless, Walts said, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Vertex share a common goal: finding new ways to tap into early-stage drug research.
10828	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which approach works best.

10854	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The two presidential candidates have battled for weeks over which one offers the most dramatic change from the current unpopular administration.
10855	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, they seized on the financial chaos to make their cases anew but offered no new proposals.
10856	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The McCain campaign quickly released a television advertisement after the disclosure that one financial giant, Lehman Brothers, had filed for bankruptcy and another, Merrill Lynch &amp
10857	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Co., Inc., had been bought out.
10858	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Our economy in crisis.
10859	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can fix it," the ad said.
10860	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On the campaign trail in Florida, however, McCain sounded a slightly different note when he said the fundamentals of the economy remained "strong."
10861	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The Obama campaign immediately pounced on that as evidence that McCain is out of touch with ordinary people.
10863	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning.
10864	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The past week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."
10865	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	For months, Obama has been calling for increased regulation and accountability for financial institutions.
10866	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	On Monday, he issued a statement that blamed the current administration for the problems and implied again that as president he would push for new regulation of the financial services sector.
10867	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"Eight years of policies that have shredded consumer protections, loosened oversight and regulation, and encouraged outsized bonuses to CEOs while ignoring middle-class Americans have brought us to the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression," Obama's statement said.
10868	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain signaled some openness to increased regulation of financial institutions to increase transparency of their dealings -- though he was more cautious than Obama.
10869	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	McCain, in a statement, said he would "replace the outdated and ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight," but also that a "highest priority" of his administration would be to ensure that the U.S. "remains the pre-eminent financial market of the world."
10870	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.
10871	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Both candidates said they supported the federal decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers with taxpayer funding.
10872	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	There are signs that Obama has not managed to capitalize on economic anxiety as decisively as might be expected.
10873	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll last week showed Obama's advantage on who would best handle the economy had dwindled to 5 percentage points: 47 percent picked Obama, 42 percent chose McCain.
10875	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	"If you are a Republican, you should be tagged on the economy.
10876	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	If there is such a thing as Republican Teflon, McCain enjoys it on this matter."
10877	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	But some of Obama's allies in the labor movement started trying to scratch McCain's Teflon even before the Lehman collapse.
10879	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The flier pokes fun at McCain's family fortune, his multiple homes, even his pricey loafers and asks: "If John McCain lost his Social Security, he'd get by just fine.
10880	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Would you?"
10882	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	In a statement Monday, the group called the Lehman collapse and the Merrill Lynch sale "perfect examples" of how a privatization would "turn Social Security from a guarantee into a guaranteed gamble."

10885	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	A 40-year-old convicted of orchestrating and participating in the fatal stabbing and beating of a man during a 1995 robbery was executed by lethal injection Thursday in the state of Texas, officials said.
10886	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Larry Davis was put to death at Huntsville Prison at 6:19 pm local time (2319 GMT), a representative of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice told AFP.
10887	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis was accused of entering the Amarillo, Texas home of Michael Barrow with several conspirators and killing Barrow, who was stabbed with a knife and an ice pick and beaten with a pipe.
10888	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Davis had proclaimed he was innocent of planning and carrying out the murder.
10889	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	The execution is the third in July in the state of Texas, and the 16th in the United States since the Supreme Court in April ruled that lethal injections are constitutional.
10890	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	Executions across the country had been put on hold for months as the court deliberated.
10891	AFP_ENG_20080801.0635.LDC2009T13	According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 16 executions are expected between now and September, including 10 more in Texas, the state that has put a record 409 people to death in the past 30 years.
10905	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	"He was brought to (the) central jail in Dhaka at about 10.15 pm (1615 GMT)," he added.
10906	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	Rahman was last week arrested and remanded in custody for four days for questioning over extortion allegations.
10907	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	Rahman had been tipped as a successor to his mother.
10911	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	Since then, a military-backed interim government has held power and says it will stage polls when a string of reforms aimed at strengthening democracy have been implemented.
10912	AFP_ENG_20070312.0444.LDC2009T13	These include a major corruption crackdown that has seen at least 45 prominent figures arrested and detained.
10913	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	IN HASSELBECK THEY TRUST
10914	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In Hasselbeck they trust Since stepping back in as the Seahawks' starting quarterback midway through the 2002 season, Matt Hasselbeck has done things by the numbers:
10915	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Completing 61 percent of his passes.
10916	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Passing for more than 3,400 yards in each of the three seasons in which he's started all 16 games, including a franchise-record 3,966 yards last year.
10917	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Throwing almost two touchdowns (131) for every interception (75).
10918	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Fashioning an 88.09 passer rating.
10919	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	And, most important, winning 63 percent of his starts (52-31).
10920	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It hasn't, however, always been as easy as Hasselbeck is making it appear.
10921	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Flip to "growing pains" in your NFL experience dictionary and the definition is what the 32-year-old Hasselbeck has endured.
10922	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	From the time he arrived in a 2001 trade with the Green Bay Packers, Brett Favre's one-time backup has had a dickens of a time living up to expectations.
10923	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	First, and perhaps foremost, he was coach Mike Holmgren's handpicked passer to replace a couple of local quarterbacks--Jon Kitna, who was not re-signed after the 2000 season
10924	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	and Brock Huard, who could not stay healthy when Holmgren tried to make him the starter not once but twice in 2000.
10925	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	To say Hasselbeck struggled initially doesn't begin to tell the story of what his first season and a half were like.
10926	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, at times, as painful to watch as it was to live through.
10927	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were groin and shoulder injuries that cost him four starts in 2001 (games backup Trent Dilfer won).
10928	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There was a demotion, which was necessary because Holmgren had to commit to Dilfer as the starter to get him to re-sign after the 2001 season.
10929	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	There were the ineffective and sometimes downright inept efforts when Hasselbeck had to step in for an injured Dilfer in 2002.
10930	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	But here Hasselbeck is, after all the trials and tribulations, the unquestioned leader of a team that is looking to capture its fifth consecutive NFC West title and advance to the playoffs for the sixth year in a row.
10931	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"This is Matt's team, no question," wide receiver Nate Burleson said.
10932	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"He is our leader, and we all need to follow his lead."
10933	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now that part seems to come easy for Hasselbeck, who is as engaging off the field as his play is efficient on the field.
10934	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck's face and voice are seemingly everywhere.
10935	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In TV commercials for Reebok and Expedia.
10936	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In newspaper ads for Jones Soda.
10937	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	In radio spots for Infiniti.
10938	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On a huge billboard, promoting the team's Web site, near the club's old headquarters in Kirkland.
10939	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	On the covers of just about every preview magazine now gracing a newsstand near you.
10940	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren could easily feel vindicated by what Hasselbeck has been able to accomplish.
10941	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Instead, the dominant feeling is pride in watching him grow into a Pro Bowl quarterback.
10942	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"I never didn't think he could do it," Holmgren said, taking a peek in his mental rearview mirror.
10943	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"But when I was positive he could be really good, and really take us to where we wanted to go, it was actually one of our tough years."
10944	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	It was, in fact, 2002.
10945	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Dilfer had gone down with a ruptured Achilles tendon in a Week 8 game at Dallas.
10946	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Holmgren handed the ball back to Hasselbeck and then him cut loose.
10947	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Twice in the final five games, Hasselbeck gave new meaning to the West Coast offense by setting the franchise record for passing yards--first in San Francisco (427 yards) and then in the season finale in San Diego (449).
10948	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"You reach a point with a player of his caliber, of his smarts and confidence, where all of a sudden you trust him," Holmgren said.
10949	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	"And that's what happened."
10950	NYT_ENG_20080903.0128.LDC2009T13	Now, his teammates also have full trust in Hasselbeck's ability to take them where they want to go.

10992	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Last year, both generals were integral to crafting and implementing Bush's new military strategy in Iraq, which included the deployment of 30,000 additional troops.
10993	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has recommended, and Bush has agreed, to withdraw the extra troops by July but to halt further reductions after that.
10994	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	Petraeus has said he needs a 45-day period of evaluation and then an indefinite period of assessment before he could recommend further pullouts.
10995	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	In his response to the committee, Petraeus reports that violence in Iraq last week was at its lowest levels in a month with trend lines indicating that security has improved.
10996	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	"Having noted that, progress is uneven and difficult challenges remain" including meddling by Iran and continued attacks by al- Qaida and sectarian militants, Petraeus wrote.
10997	APW_ENG_20080522.0213.LDC2009T13	But, he later added, "we have seen more unity across sectarian lines at the national level, and this presents opportunities for further progress."

11017	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux all posted excellent European wins, but that has been overshadowed by the fate of one Marseille fan facing an eight-year jail term following an incident at an Atletico Madrid match.
11018	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	The supporter, Santos Mirasierra, is accused of inciting disorder, attacking a policemen and resisting arrest, and has been detained in Spain since the incident on October 1.
11019	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	And, instead of focusing on Saturday's match with Grenoble, Marseille players were this week rallying to Mirasierra's cause.

11022	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	"Not a day goes by without mention of Santos' name in the dressing room," said coach Eric Gerets.

11024	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	It's high time he was released."
11025	AFP_ENG_20081107.5006.LDC2009T13	Gerets said he was horrified by the reaction of police in Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium, where it is alleged they used excessive force to quell the unfolding violence on the terraces.

11071	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car ushers in a new era with the standing start
11072	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	PORTLAND, Oregon 2007-06-13 21:06:33 UTC
11073	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Justin Wilson admits he's going to have to pay a bit more attention now that Champ Car has adopted the standing start.
11074	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I saw the lights go out and I thought, 'I'm meant to do something now,'" he joked after the inaugural race to use the start.
11075	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I have to work on my reactions."
11077	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts -- the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead stop on a grid.
11078	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	When the last of a bank of lights above the track goes out, the drivers take off.
11079	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Once all the red lights go out, you drop your clutch and go, and that's the start," said Wilson, who had the pole for the race.
11080	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's quite a buildup in tension because you have a few moments where it's very quiet and nothing's happening and then all of the sudden everyone's on full throttle and they drop their clutch."
11081	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car had wanted to use standing starts at the beginning of the season, but it was delayed for further testing until the Grand Prix of Portland, the fourth race of the season.
11082	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The move toward standing starts got a mixed reaction from drivers.
11083	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Points leader and three-time defending series champion Sebastien Bourdais was especially vocal with concerns that drivers could stall at the start, setting up rear-end accidents all over the grid.
11084	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total disaster," he said.
11085	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Many drivers already had experience with the procedure.
11086	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The Champ Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for the most part.
11087	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because there's so much more power," Rahal said.
11088	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to put the power down on these cars as it is.
11089	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	In third gear coming out of a corner it can be hard to do.
11090	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	So doing it from a stop is a tough thing, especially when it is wet."
11091	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Fellow rookie Robert Doornbos brought in perspective from two seasons with Formula One.
11092	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains Doornbos.
11093	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Here it is all driver.
11094	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	If you mess up, you stall and have a big problem.
11095	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I did three or four and it went quite well.
11096	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
11097	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to the rolling start.
11098	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled, which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland.
11099	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean it's never going to happen.
11100	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It means I was a little more pessimistic than the truth.
11101	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Definitely put on a good show."
11102	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Cleveland will be the next chance for fans to see the standing start, which Champ Car is expected to use the remainder of the season.
11103	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But many drivers say they'd like the series to keep rolling starts in the mix, too.
11104	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm not sure which I prefer.
11105	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I like doing them both," Wilson said.
11106	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season.
11107	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I think that's the best way.
11108	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	To master both skills is the best thing for the drivers."

11110	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	LAUSANNE, Switzerland 2008-07-29 16:29:24 UTC
11111	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
11112	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
11113	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.
11114	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee already had said the warning did not affect Hamm's spot on the team for the Beijing Games.
11115	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG's announcement came a day after Hamm's twin brother, Paul, withdrew from the Olympics, saying he won't be healthy enough to defend his all-around title.
11116	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Paul Hamm had a broken right hand and strained left rotator cuff.
11117	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle.
11118	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	After being notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
11119	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USADA said it had "absolutely no concern" the shot was for anything but medicinal purposes.
11120	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	As part of his punishment, Hamm's results from the second day of nationals were wiped out.
11121	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm would still have made the team.
11124	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	The easing in electronics shipments, the country's top export, was offset by gains in sales of petroleum and copper, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.

11159	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Fast bowler Dale Steyn took six West Indies wickets on Saturday to lead South Africa to easy victory in the third test and a 2-1 win in the three-match series.
11160	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn finished with 6-72 and South Africa won by an innings and 100 runs -- with two days to spare -- after West Indies' second innings ended at 317-9.
11161	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unable to bat because of flu.
11163	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	West Indies won the first test by 128 runs and South Africa leveled the series with a seven-wicket win in the second test.
11164	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But West Indies faced an uphill task to save the third test after South Africa dismissed the visitors for 139 in their first innings at Kingsmead Stadium, and then scored 556-4 in reply.
11165	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	After a fourth-wicket stand of 144 between Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo, Steyn struck with the second new ball of the innings, dismissing Bravo leg before wicket for 75 soon after tea.
11166	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	But Samuels managed to bring up his second test century, making 105 off 190 balls with 18 boundaries.
11167	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We fought well," Bravo said.
11168	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We must remember South Africa is the No. 2 team in the world, and we are a young team with new coaching staff."
11169	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Despite winning the series, South Africa dropped two places to fourth spot in test rankings, the International Cricket Council said.
11170	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Australia remained top.
11171	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Denesh Ramdin stayed with Samuels and made 25 before Andre Nel tempted him to flash at a wide delivery outside the off stump and give an easy catch to Mark Boucher.
11172	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shortly after making his century, Samuels fell to a delivery from Steyn which clipped his off stump.
11173	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	The dismissal signaled a collapse for West Indies, and Steyn ripped through the rest of the tail.
11174	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Darren Sammy was out for 17 in a looping caught-and-bowled by Steyn, who also hit the offstumps of Daren Powell and Fidel Edwards -- both for ducks -- to wrap up the match.
11175	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the series at an average of 19.10.
11176	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Samuels and Bravo saw West Indies reach 230-3 at tea after a poor start to the day.
11177	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Resuming on their overnight total of 23, opening batsmen Darren Ganga and Brenton Parchment added 10 more runs before Parchment was trapped leg before wicket by Steyn for 20.
11178	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
11179	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before wicket for 37.
11180	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut back in on him.
11181	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock, 34, later announced it was his last test.
11182	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"It's great to be able to finish my test career on my home ground, and especially in a match where the guys played so well," said Pollock, who said he would retire from international cricket after the one-day series against West Indies that finishes next month.
11183	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"But with Dale bowling so well, they don't need me," added Pollock, who took a record 421 test wickets for South Africa at an average of 23.11.
11184	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock also averaged 32.31 with the bat, hitting a total of 3,781 test runs.
11186	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"I hope the whole of South Africa knows what a great player will be missing from our team now, he is one of the all-time greats," Smith said.
11187	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Also Saturday, Parchment was fined half his match fee by the ICC after being found guilty of breaching its Code of Conduct.
11188	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"In the eighth over of West Indies second innings, Parchment intentionally ran into opposition fast bowler Dale Steyn," the ICC statement said.
11189	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Parchment has the right of appeal.

11194	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall had earlier taken 3-50 and Charl Langeveldt 2-48, their figures inflated by a late flurry of shots as Dougie Brown (45), John Blain (23) and Paul Hoffman (18) took Scotland to its best World Cup score.
11196	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith won the toss and opted to field, with Makhaya Ntini's return for fast bowler Andre Nel the only change to the team that beat the Netherlands by 221 runs on Friday.
11197	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Both teams and match officials, who all wore black arm-bands, lined up on either side of the pitch to observe a minutes' silence as a mark of respect for Bob Woolmer.
11199	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Watts and Haq were watchful early on to take Scotland to 16-0 by the eighth over, but Haq hit Pollock for two fours and Haq cracked a six off Ntini as 15 was added in the next two overs.
11200	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall replaced Ntini in the 12th over and struck on his second ball with Scotland on 35, having Haq caught behind for 13.
11201	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith brought on Langeveldt to replace Pollock and his second change also proved a master-stroke -- Watts (24) nicking his first ball to Smith at slip to leave Scotland on 43-2.
11202	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Hall collected his second wicket 20 runs later when Gavin Hamilton (4) was caught driving to cover by de Villiers.
11203	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Langeveldt did likewise by bowling McCallum (1) with a yorker and Scotland was 71-4 in the 25th over.
11204	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Five overs later, Colin Smith, who scored 51 against Australia to become the second Scotsman to score a World Cup half-century, played a shot to point and de Villiers' direct hit beat Ryan Watson (31) home.
11205	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith was bowled by a Pollock off-cutter for 15 with Scotland on 113-6 in the 39th over.
11206	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	But Brown put on 50 with Blain inside nine overs after Ryan Watson (31) had earlier set a platform.
11207	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Blain was finally out in the 48th, caught by Justin Kemp at extra-cover off Hall's bowling.
11209	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The two openers were never troubled, until de Villiers was caught on the long-off fence by Brown off Glenn Rogers in the 16th over with victory in sight.
11210	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Ashwell Prince was promoted up the order to gain some batting practice, before a heavy rainstorm stopped play at 147-1 for 25 minutes.
11211	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	The break didn't help Prince, who was caught by McCallum at short-cover for 21 from Haq's offspin with South Africa on 162.
11212	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Smith was caught by Rogers at midwicket off Haq's bowling as he fell nine runs short of his maiden World Cup century -- with South Africa requiring 9 to win.
11213	APW_ENG_20070320.1337.LDC2009T13	Kemp (12 not out), who was also shifted up the order, finished the match with a massive straight six.

11217	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Karadzic, who faces trial by a UN tribunal for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, was arrested in Belgrade on Monday, having evaded capture for more than a decade whilst using a fake identity.
11218	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Mila Damianov, a Belgrade native who says she met Karadzic under his assumed name Dragan Dabic at an alternative health seminar in late 2007, denied that their relationship went beyond a professional interest.
11219	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I was not his fiancee, I was his assistant, but also his pupil," she told La Repubblica.
11220	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"When I heard the news, I thought it must have been a mistake, and I'm still having difficulty believing it now.

11225	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	She added: "We met about seven or eight months ago during an alternative medicine seminar in Belgrade.
11226	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Dabic was very competent in his field, which fascinated me."
11227	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"He told me he was caring for an autistic child.
11228	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I asked him if I could become his assistant and he accepted.
11229	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Thanks to the energy he put into it, this child has made enormous progress."
11230	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I never doubted his identity," she told the newspaper.
11231	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"I saw him like a saint, an apostle for those who are suffering."
11232	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	"He never spoke of politics.
11233	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	I asked him a few questions about his past, but all he told me was that he had been married, that he had children and grand- children."
11234	AFP_ENG_20080725.0315.LDC2009T13	Asked if she wanted to see Karadzic again, Damianov replied: "Yes, certainly.

11239	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush to sign US-India nuclear deal law
11245	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of India’s emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an independent course from Washington.
11248	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Neither Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama nor Republican rival John McCain were expected to break from campaigning to attend the signing.
11249	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership," Carroll said in a statement.
11250	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"This legislation will strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner," he said.
11251	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls global atomic trade.
11252	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
11253	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a foreign policy success.
11254	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
11256	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	New Delhi was reluctant to sign the deal before Bush inked the pact but pledged during Rice's visit to India late last week to do so soon after.

11274	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The year automakers have been dreading has begun.
11275	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts forecast U.S. sales could fall by as many as 1 million vehicles in January compared to the same month last year, bearing out predictions that 2008 could be the worst year for automakers in more than a decade.
11276	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers report January sales on Friday.
11278	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toprak and others predict January sales will be down 3 percent and that few automakers will escape unscathed.
11279	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	January sales are normally lower after the holiday rush in December.
11280	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	But analysts say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when automakers introduce new products and the election brings political uncertainty to an end.
11281	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, buyers are skittish.
11282	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy in January than they had been in December.
11283	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The group said most of the 5,000 U.S. households surveyed expect business conditions and employment to deteriorate further in the months ahead.
11284	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Analysts say that will have a direct affect on the auto industry.
11286	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
11288	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Barry predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993.
11289	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Other analysts forecast higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales will likely fall below 16 million.
11290	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers sold 16.3 million vehicles in 2007.
11291	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit sales to rental-car fleets.
11292	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Ford reduced rental fleet sales by 32 percent in 2007 and has vowed to make more -- although less aggressive -- cuts in 2007.
11294	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the line on incentive spending.
11295	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers have been trying to rely less on costly incentives, and Nesvold said the level of December spending -- an average of $2,746 (euro1,854) per vehicle industrywide -- was down from a year earlier.
11296	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Still, December spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to shore up the market with incentives.
11297	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	That trend could get worse before it gets better.
11298	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	GM and Toyota Motor Corp., already locked in a battle in the full-size pickup market, could pile on more incentives to hold onto their share as Ford and Chrysler introduce new pickups this fall.
11299	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toyota and GM were already putting nearly $3,000 (euro2,026) per vehicle on their new full-size trucks in 2007.
11300	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Toprak said Honda Motor Co. is one of the few automakers who could buck the trend in January.
11301	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Honda's sales were strong in the last few months of 2007 thanks to its Honda Fit subcompact and redesigned Honda Accord sedan, and that could carry into 2008 as consumers look for more fuel-efficient cars.

11311	NYT_ENG_20070410.0095.LDC2009T13	It is not unusual for an adolescent to have an 11 a.m. lunch period, with practice at 4 p.m.

11361	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	John McCain's health care plan would reduce the ranks of the roughly 45 million uninsured Americans by about 21.1 million people if fully implemented by 2010, while Barack Obama's would reduce the number by 26.6 million, a new analysis predicts.
11362	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Some previous reviews of the two presidential candidates' health plans indicated that Republican McCain's proposals would amount to little more than a wash when it comes to the number of uninsured in the United States.
11363	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The analysis released Wednesday by The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, drew a more optimistic scenario about the overall number of people who would get health coverage under McCain's plan.
11364	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The cost for both candidates' plans are enormous.
11365	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain's plan was projected to cost more than $2 trillion from 2010 through 2019.
11366	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Democrat Obama's plan would cost $1.17 trillion.
11367	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Neither candidate provides specifics on how to cover the costs, The Lewin Group said.
11368	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The United States, which has a population of about 300 million, is one of the few western countries without universal health care.
11369	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	McCain has proposed two distinct changes to the current system.
11370	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The first is a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals or $5,000 for a family that buys health insurance.
11371	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	The credit would replace the tax break people now get for obtaining health coverage through their work.
11372	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Second, McCain calls for letting people shop across state lines when buying insurance, essentially letting millions bypass states where insurance is more expensive and comprehensive.
11373	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	About half of the nation's uninsured adults are ages 19-34.
11374	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	They are the youngest and cheapest to cover, and they are the ones that would generally gain coverage under McCain's proposal, Sheils said.
11375	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Obama's plan would expand health insurance coverage through public programs.
11376	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	He requires all children to have health coverage.
11377	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	In all, about 16 million people would gain coverage through those programs.
11378	APW_ENG_20081008.1449.LDC2009T13	Another 10 million would use government subsidies to buy insurance coverage.

11389	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	NO CHECKS FOR BOMBS IN CERTIFIED AIR CARGO
11390	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
11392	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
11393	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in getting the legislation blocked.
11394	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But in late July, Democrats passed the measure.
11396	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey put a video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website, proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger planes."
11397	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the Transportation Security Administration, which was given three years under the law to develop a full inspection program, says it is interpreting the statute to allow boxes sealed by government-certified shippers to be loaded directly on planes.
11399	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by hand, just like bags checked by passengers.
11400	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	They said the Bush administration's decision to implement the new law with a "certified shippers" program is only a slight improvement over the current system, which allows cargo from "known shippers" to be loaded directly onto passenger planes.
11401	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The only difference is that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not have to meet security standards.
11403	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines up on the deck where they run it through.
11404	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	That's what we want" for cargo.
11405	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the TSA's procedures are finalized.
11406	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the early signs, he said, show that "it will be necessary to very closely monitor how this law is implemented."
11407	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"I am outraged that the Bush administration and the airline industry would even think that they could get away with anything less than a full physical screening of all cargo that goes onto passenger planes," Markey said.
11408	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.
11409	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He has filed six bills and eight amendments, called four press conferences, and issued 17 news releases.
11410	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He is known for using props to demonstrate how terrorists could plant bombs in airline cargo.
11411	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But the passenger airline industry had stoutly resisted any such requirement, saying it would cause delays that could jeopardize $4.3 billion per year in cargo business for air carriers.
11412	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry has also long insisted that machines do not exist that can screen certain densely-packed cargo boxes.
11413	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
11414	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The company that makes the machines says they can inspect large shipments of cargo without unpacking them.
11415	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to enact a law requiring such screening.
11416	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Immediately after Democrats won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill passed.
11418	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the Democratic-controlled Congress passed Markey's proposal as part of the 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act, which Bush signed Aug. 3.
11419	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute requires the TSA to set up a cargo-screening system that will "provide a level of security commensurate with the level of security for the screening of passenger checked bags" within three years.
11420	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Many supporters of the bill assumed that meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either X-rayed or physically inspected.
11421	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute says the TSA must require more than a simple check of a shipment's paperwork against a database of registered shippers.
11422	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The law requires that if such data checks are used, they must be paired with a physical check or screening method approved by the TSA.
11423	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute does not require the screening to be performed on the airport premises or specify any screening method, but lists several examples of methods that would suffice, including X-ray machines, explosive detection systems, bomb-sniffing dogs, and a physical search.
11425	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He said the agency is also considering whether to require tamper-evident seals on cargo shipments.
11426	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Together, such precautions would be good enough, he said.
11427	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline industry, declined to comment on the new screening law.
11428	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
11429	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
11430	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
11432	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey said he is willing to give the TSA a chance to demonstrate that a "pack and seal approach" could really achieve the same level of security screening for bombs that checked luggage receives at airports, but expressed doubts.
11433	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	If Congress decides that the final regulations for freight security are not truly "commensurate" with the level of security that checked bags receive, Markey said, he and other lawmakers will seek to change them.
11434	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.
11435	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"If the Bush administration tries to bend the law, it is going to discover that there is a new sheriff in town."

11439	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Palin, running mate to Republican presidential nominee John McCain, is the subject of two inquiries into whether she abused her power by firing her public safety commissioner.

11442	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	The report the McCain-Palin campaign released Thursday night says the firing was based on a budget dispute.
11443	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Since then, the report says, the matter has been muddled with innuendo, rumor and politics.
11448	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The artillery bombardment sent clouds of white smoke rising from the camp, and the shelling ignited fires inside it, spewing black smoke.
11449	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The militants have barricaded themselves in the camp's residential neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets and apartment buildings.
11450	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	However, reports on the ground indicated the army did not penetrate deep into the camp, but limited its advance to outer neighborhoods militants use for sniper fire against army positions.
11453	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He said there would be no storming of the camp's interior, where thousands of civilians remain.
11457	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants also have been killed before Friday's fighting.
11458	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	About 50 armored carriers, battle tanks and military vehicles from elite units massed at the northern edge of the camp and drove toward the forward positions, according to an AP Television News crew at the scene.
11459	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling, accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the troops were in close combat with the militants.
11460	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	But the bombardment again intensified several hours later.
11461	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's northern edge.
11462	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	They said operation sought to silence the militant fire to protect army positions.

11466	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He told AP Television News in Beirut that the army may be seeking to isolate the militants.
11469	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"It seems they have destroyed those positions."
11472	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	A soldier belonging to an armored carriers unit on the camp's edge said the troops were advancing slowly and fighting building- to-building, after bombing positions in the morning.
11473	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"They are in very well-fortified positions," he said of the militants, adding troops were coming under sniper fire.
11474	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media.

11505	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Lightly clad cowgirls hefting six-guns were stand-ins for the camp followers of the soldiers in the Verdi opera.
11506	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tableaux of military life were turned into grisly portraits of Hell with a touch of Bosch, mixed with T.S. Eliot.
11507	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And Pountney's skeptical view of religion made the final moments of the hero's reconciliation with God, Heaven and the death of his beloved Leonora a hard sell.
11508	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Adding to difficulties is that even without Pountney, this opera calls for an indulgent audience ready to accept a plot almost as cliche as the notion of "it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
11509	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Don Alvaro, the hero, is caught in the bedroom of Leonora by her father.
11510	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As he drops his pistol in submission it goes off, killing the elderly nobleman and setting into notion the "power of destiny" that ultimately leads to two more deaths
11511	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	that of Leonora's brother by the hero and of Leonora herself, killed by her brother literally as he expires from the sword wound inflicted by Alvaro.
11512	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Originally the hero himself was to commit suicide.
11513	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Perhaps fearful of the prospect of nobody left to take a curtain call, Verdi himself wrote co-librettist Maria Piave: "We need to think about the ending and find some way to avoid all those dead bodies."
11514	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	So in the version performed Saturday, Alvaro remains alive and redeemed, though deeply depressed.
11515	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that the audience was spared that condition Saturday was due less to the controversial production and more to the excellence of the musical performances both on stage and in the pit.
11517	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Under his baton, the violin section sounded as if one powerful instrument.
11518	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His horns packed more oomph than any brass band.
11519	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	And his woodwinds were tremulous, breathy and vulnerable, reflecting the pathos of the action under the spotlights.
11520	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His cues were perfect, his pauses powerful.
11521	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The principals also rose to the musical challenge.
11522	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Nina Stemme was a wonderful Leonora, with her Wagner-honed heroic soprano the perfect instrument for the vocal athletics called for by Verdi.
11523	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Her voice was fully rounded, powerful and evocative at all levels.
11524	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Complementing her sound was her excellent dramatic rendering of the heroine doomed by destiny.
11525	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Among her highlights on Saturday: "Madre pietosa Vergine."
11526	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	(Holy Mother hear my prayer.)
11527	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	The sporadic boos mixed with the bravos for Salvatore Licitra were undeserved.
11528	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	His warm and broad tenor was a lovely match for Stemme, making him a thoroughly enjoyable Alvaro.
11529	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	But the best male role of the evening was given by Carlos Alvarez.
11530	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	As Don Carlo, Leonora's vengeful brother, his rich and vibrant baritone, coupled with a menacing and possessed stage presence, had all eyes and ears focused on him, at times even when he was not at center stage.
11531	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Also good: the choir, under Thomas Lang
11532	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Alastair Miles as Leonora's father and the father superior
11533	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Tiziano Bracci as Melitone, the friar, and Nadia Krasteva as Preziosilla, the camp fortuneteller who in Pountney's version turns into a pistol- packing, hotpants-wearing Annie Oakley.
11534	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	Saturday's performance was a mix of obsession, revenge, love and madness on stage
11535	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	hatred from some audience members incensed with the production, and redemption, as in the healing power of wonderful music on stage and in the pit.
11536	APW_ENG_20080302.0096.LDC2009T13	All in all, a powerful night at the opera.

11554	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Bollywood's boys bulk up, add brawn to brooding
11555	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Bollywood's leading actors are hitting the gym as never before, adding brawn and biceps to their on-screen repertoires and winning a legion of new fans in the process -- including other men.
11556	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	The latest weight-training convert is Aamir Khan, who enlisted the help of physical trainer Satyajit Chourasia two years ago to get in shape for the film "Ghajini", which is released on December 25.
11557	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	His daily four-hour regime appears to have paid off.
11558	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Giant advertising hoardings show a shaven-headed Khan, who plays a man with memory loss who tattoos himself and takes Polaroid pictures to remember people and places, stripped to the waist, exposing a finely-ripped torso.
11559	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	The 43-year-old said the film's director A. Murgadoss told him to bulk up because it was essential for the character.
11560	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"I too felt that I will not be able to do justice to my role if I am not in this shape," he said this week.
11561	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Asked whether his new look could help boost box office takings, he said it was creating "a lot of buzz among viewers, which is good for the film."
11562	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Historically, the muscle-bound macho hero has never been in vogue in Bollywood.
11563	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Instead, leading men were as likely to be measured by the manly thickness of their chest hair or how they carried a tune or moved in the set-piece song and dance routines.
11564	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Eyeing the success of Hollywood's Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1980s, Bollywood's Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt began working out, winning accolades and a dedicated fanbase.
11565	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	But it was not until megastar Shah Rukh Khan got a "six pack" for his 2007 blockbuster "Om Shanti Om" that muscle tone became a must for aspiring Bollywood actors.
11566	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Actor John Abraham enlisted the help of Hollywood personal trainer Mike Ryan to prepare for appearing on camera in only a pair of swimming trunks on Miami beach in the film "Dostana", which was released in October.
11567	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"I went on high protein and vigorous training to get that kind of look," he said.
11568	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"It was essential to work out more because I had little time on my hands and had to get that kind of muscular look to complete the film on time."
11569	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	His new look has won him a legion of new fans, including in the gay community, he added.
11570	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"Earlier some women used to make a pass on me but now even men make passes at me," said Abraham, who has been nicknamed "The Hunk."
11571	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	Satyajit Chourasia is full of praise for actors he has worked with, from Aamir Khan to Saif Ali Khan and Zayed Khan, as well as Hrithik Roshan and Ajay Devgan.
11572	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	"All the actors are very dedicated.
11573	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	They don't skip their exercises and maintain themselves which you can see with their looks on the big screen," he said.
11575	AFP_ENG_20081217.0760.LDC2009T13	But having a perfect physique can have its disadvantages.

11588	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Everyone was asked to rise.
11589	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen stepped forward, followed by an entourage of city department heads.
11590	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	His smile looked more pained than happy, and he waved stiffly at board members and the handful of people who sat in the audience.
11591	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.
11592	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once heralded as a brilliant state legislator and a can-do mayor loved by the wealthy and well-connected in his hometown, Cohen, 60, is expected to make an announcement today about his election plans for 2009.
11593	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Many of his allies expect him to call it quits.
11594	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The fall from grace followed missteps richly woven into a city that prides itself on good schools, parks, and expensive real estate.
11595	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The new $197 million high school Cohen has staked his reputation on has become the most expensive school construction in state history and a symbol of suburban excess.
11596	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The local weekly twice called for him to leave office at the end of his term.
11598	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	And in the midst of these battles, Cohen this week proposed increasing his salary of $97,876 by 28 percent, quickly withdrawing the idea after it was greeted with derision.
11600	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has become a kind of lightning rod on the ((override)) issue.
11601	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	People have said to me that they would otherwise vote yes, but are uncomfortable doing so with him in office beyond this term."
11603	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There have been some concerns that the programming is extravagant, that the building" is extravagant, Cohen said, growing angry with a reporter's questions.
11604	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"Nothing could be further from the truth."
11605	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Soaring construction costs, an expensive building design that allows for natural light in classrooms.
11606	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	and expensive technological efficiencies, like a fuel efficient heating system, account for the school's high cost, he said.
11607	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He noted repeatedly that the project is "exactly the same" as it was when it was conceived, approved, and voted on by aldermen and taxpayers several years ago.
11608	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing secretive about it," he said before cutting the interview short.
11609	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"They ((critics)) say there's not enough money and there's too much money.
11610	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	I've planned for contingencies."
11612	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Newton may be a small city of 80,000, but politicians frequently talk about residents' "expectation of excellence," especially when it comes to schools.
11613	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's plans for the new Newton North High were clearly designed to meet that standard.
11614	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	In 2002, he announced plans to renovate Newton North High School, but the $40 million renovation ballooned into a $109 million project to build a new "state of the art" high school after parents learned that students would need to be relocated during construction.
11615	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Aldermen and state officials urged Cohen to scale back the new plan, but he did not.
11616	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Instead, with the support of a majority of the aldermen, the city hired architect Graham Gund to design the building.
11617	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Since then, costs continued to soar.
11620	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I don't think it's fair to jump to a conclusion that he had someone do his dirty work," Solomon said about Cohen, in reference to the incident.
11621	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He has faced the Board of Aldermen on many, many occasions and not only to present good news."
11622	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Solomon said last night that he could not remember the circumstances of why the mayor may have left City Hall that day.
11623	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's coalition of support had already begun to crumble, undermined by the cost of the building, an unrelated fight with the city firefighters union, and increasingly feisty aldermen.
11625	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She said it was a big change from her early days in office when Cohen invited board members to meetings in his office, and she thought they shared many similar views on education (she supported the new school) and the environment.
11626	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	She has since broken with Cohen.
11627	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"He was elected to set the policy and vision of the city.
11628	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	What has his vision been?"
11629	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Sangiolo said.
11631	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen's refusal to acknowledge critics' concerns has baffled even supporters.
11632	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Martina Jackson, cochairwoman of the Newton City Democratic Committee and a personal friend of 30 years, said Cohen is not a glad hander.
11633	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	He can be "awkward socially" but funny, she said.
11634	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was a state legislator, he called her to pose this Woody Allen-esque question: If police arrested Marcel Marceau, would officers have to mime him his Miranda rights?
11635	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Some say the writing is on the wall.
11636	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen did not hold his annual fund-raiser this year, and gave his campaign manager permission to get rid of his lawn signs.
11637	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"In our opinion, it's clear he does not intend to run again," said Christopher Hill of Move Newton Forward, the pro-override group.
11638	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	Cohen surely hopes his legacy will be Newton North High School.
11639	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	But that legacy will undoubtedly be colored by the pay raise proposal.
11641	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"I'm sorry about that," she said.
11642	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	"And I'm sure he is, too."

11686	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN and Michael Moore trade angry accusations over `Sicko ' accuracy
11688	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"Sicko" filmmaker Michael Moore called a truce Monday in his weeklong fight with CNN that flared when the network accused him of misstating facts in his popular documentary about the health- care system.
11689	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore had promised the network over the weekend that "I'm about to become your worst nightmare," leading CNN to post on its Web site a remarkably lengthy response to his accusations.
11690	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore noted in an interview Monday that CNN had admitted to two mistakes in its reporting on "Sicko" and that he is willing to move on.
11692	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's a whole lot more to do with this other than I and others are going to be a lot more skeptical with what I see on CNN."
11693	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN, in its statement, noted that it has given Moore multiple opportunities to discuss his concerns about the report on the air.
11694	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic that someone who has made a career out of holding powerful interests accountable is so sensitive to having his own work held up to the light by impartial journalists, as we did in our examination of `Sicko,'" CNN said.
11695	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Shortly before Moore appeared for an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, the network ran a report by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that had done some fact-checking on Moore's movie.
11697	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Gupta addressed several statistics in "Sicko" before concluding: "No matter how much Moore fudged the facts -- and he did fudge some facts -- there is one thing everyone can agree on: the (health care) system here should be far better."
11698	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In Gupta's report, CNN had said that Moore had reported that Cuba spends $25 (euro18) per person for health care.
11700	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN blamed a transcription error for its mistake and apologized for it on and off the air.
11701	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network accuses Moore of "cherry-picking" numbers from different academic studies to make his arguments stronger.
11702	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	CNN said it believes in essentially comparing apples with apples.
11703	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he tried to use the most recent data available.
11704	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore was also angry that Gupta interviewed Paul Keckley, who works for the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, as a critic of "Sicko."
11708	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"We checked it, Michael.
11709	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We checked his conflict of interest.
11710	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	We do ask those questions."
11711	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	While CNN noted Moore was correct in pointing out Keckley had left Vanderbilt last year, it said Keckley's comments were factual and descriptive.
11712	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Deloitte says it does not have a political agenda.
11713	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	In other instances, CNN said Moore appeared to be creating a fight where none really existed.
11714	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	The network said it was comfortable letting viewers judge for themselves.
11715	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	Moore said he believed it was important for him to let people know his side.
11716	APW_ENG_20070716.1418.LDC2009T13	"In the report they say that I fudged the facts," he said, "and they didn't find a single fact that I fudged."

11719	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A group of family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, outraged by city plans to move the commemoration ceremony, filed a request Wednesday asking to hold the annual event at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center.
11720	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The coalition filed the request with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site.
11721	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The agency says construction at the site would make a ceremony there unsafe, but family members plan to sue if they are denied.
11722	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"This is the place we have.
11723	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	A precedent has been set in letting us touch ground zero," said Diane Horning, a representative of one of the family groups.
11724	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Rosaleen Tallon, of Advocates for a 9/11 Fallen Heroes Memorial, said remains of people killed in the 2001 terror attack are still being found at the site.
11725	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"How can we possibly not go there to memorialize these people?"
11726	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	she said.
11727	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It is still their resting place, and I want to be there."
11728	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The city has said that ground zero, now undergoing reconstruction, is not safe for the large annual gathering, and it plans to move the recitation of names to a nearby plaza.
11730	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"It's just not safe," Bloomberg said.
11731	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"Listen, we've had enough tragedy on that site.
11732	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Our first priority, No. 1, is to make sure that everybody's safe, and nothing's going to get us off that."
11733	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Attorney Norman Siegel, who is representing the families, said that if the Port Authority rejects the permit, the families would consider a federal lawsuit on First Amendment grounds.
11734	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	He said the groups had gotten consultations on safety and security and that the site would be safe as long as the construction was halted the day of the ceremony.
11736	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"As an agency that lost 84 friends and colleagues on September 11, the Port Authority is sensitive to the needs of those who lost loved ones," he said.
11737	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"We are actively looking at ways to accommodate family members who want to pay their respects on the World Trade Center site on 9/11, but the substantial construction activity and current site conditions will not allow the formal ceremony to be safely conducted on the site."
11739	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	The roll call stops only for moments of silence at the times the two planes hit and the twin towers collapsed.
11740	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	During the reading, and throughout the rest of the day, families have had access to the seven-story pit that was once the basement of the twin towers, where they would lay flowers.
11741	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg said family members will be able to leave flowers in an area along the southern edge of the site, but they will not be allowed into the pit.
11742	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"There isn't a place to do that anymore, unfortunately, and next year there will be even less," he said.
11743	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	"The next time you'll be able to have a ceremony on the site is really when we complete the memorial."
11744	APW_ENG_20070801.1474.LDC2009T13	Construction on the memorial began last year, and it is expected to open in 2009.

11766	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	He said in a telephone interview that three truckloads of riot police arrived at the headquarters around midday.
11767	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	The police broke up a "routine meeting" called by the MDC to discuss party issues ahead of next year's crucial presidential and parliamentary polls, Chamisa added.

11777	APW_ENG_20070526.0545.LDC2009T13	But Saturday's meeting "was neither a demonstration nor a rally," Chamisa said.

11790	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Times may be tough in the real world.
11791	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Not in Hollywood.
11792	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	As it usually does during economic downturns, the movie business has come on strong, expected to set a summer revenue record of about $4.2 billion from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers.
11793	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	That would put Hollywood a fraction ahead of the previous record of $4.18 billion in summer 2007, though accounting for inflation, the actual number of tickets sold -- about 587 million -- is down 3.5 percent.
11794	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Still, given the sluggish economy, studio executives are happy their business held up so well.
11795	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	It's almost a tradition dating back to the Depression: When the economy goes sour, the escapism and relative cheapness of a night at the movies is an attractive prospect for audiences.
11796	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"Let's face it.
11798	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	The behemoth of summer was the Warner Bros.
11799	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman sequel "The Dark Knight," whose haul -- $500 million and counting -- amounted to nearly one-eighth of overall Hollywood revenues.
11800	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" passed "Star Wars" to rank No. 2 on the all- time domestic revenue chart, behind only "Titanic" at $600.8 million.
11801	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Batman mania already was high as production wrapped last fall, but it grew to a fever after Heath Ledger, who co-stars as the Joker, died in January.
11802	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"We would not be looking at a $4 billion summer if not for `The Dark Knight,'" said Paul Dergarabedian, Media By Numbers president.
11803	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"In this case, one film made a huge difference."
11804	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and four other superhero tales -- "Hancock," Paramount's "Iron Man," and Universal's "The Incredible Hulk" and "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" -- rang up $1.25 billion, 30 percent of the summer box office.
11805	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Add in the $315 million take for Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and it's clear that audiences were looking for pure adventure this summer.
11806	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	On the family front, the animated tales "WALL-E" from Disney and "Kung Fu Panda" from DreamWorks both topped $200 million.
11807	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	There was a healthy dose of chick flicks during the male-dominated summer with Warner's "Sex and the City" and Universal's "Mamma Mia!"
11808	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	-- both $100 million hits.
11809	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Raunchy comedy also packed in crowds with the R-rated hits "Tropic Thunder" from Paramount and "Step Brothers" and "Pineapple Express," both from Sony.
11810	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Some major flops accompanied the successes.
11811	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Eddie Murphy bombed with his sci-fi comedy "Meet Dave" from 20th Century Fox, as did Mike Myers with Paramount's comedy "The Love Guru."

11813	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	Yet most big studio films delivered, finding both commercial success and better-than-usual reaction from critics, who typically tear many summer blockbusters to shreds.
11814	APW_ENG_20080905.0032.LDC2009T13	"The Dark Knight" and "Iron Man" earned some of the best reviews ever for summer popcorn flicks, the acclaim helping to keep the theaters packed.

11829	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Against Ottawa, Bruins' Thornton had the upper hands
11830	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His name is not on the scoring summary, but Shawn Thornton left an impression in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators yesterday.
11831	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Twice the burly fourth-line wing saw a teammate knocked to the ice and stepped into the offending Senator with his fists cocked, standing up for his teammate, hockey-style.
11832	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton left impressions of his knuckles on the faces of Chris Neil and Cody Bass, and that left an impression on his teammates, and his coach.
11833	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I love this time of year," said Thornton, who signed with the Bruins last summer after earning a Stanley Cup ring with the Anaheim Ducks.

11837	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	The Bruins, locked in a final-stretch struggle to make the playoffs, want and probably need points from their final four games to ensure a top-eight spot in the Eastern Conference.
11838	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	It took a while for the Bruins to uncork their offense, and Thornton helped shake it loose.
11840	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	A few minutes later, Thornton called Neil aside and opened up a little chat with his fists.
11841	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It wasn't so much to set the tone as retribution for the hit on Reicher," said Thornton.
11842	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I didn't see it because I was forechecking right away.
11844	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	We're down again after ((Reich)) left, and everyone pulled up their socks again, so congrats to everyone for standing in there."
11845	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	P.J. Axelsson and Marco Sturm scored early in the second period, but then Senators rookie Bass barreled into Mark Stuart behind the Bruins net, arriving perhaps a bit late to an already crowded scrum.
11846	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart skated slowly off the ice with his left arm hanging.
11847	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton was incensed.
11848	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Or maybe just pumped up.
11849	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	His body language betrayed his rink rage.
11850	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	No time to chat, Cody Bass, say hello to my fist.
11851	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I thought it was a high-stick ((on Stuart))," said Thornton.
11852	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It was more reactionary than anything else.
11853	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I had just come on the ice and I saw Stuart laying there.
11854	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"It's our house and I don't want people taking liberties with one of my teammates, especially if I'm on the ice.
11855	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	I'm not going to let that slide."
11856	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Though Stuart returned a few minutes later (he called the injury to his right arm a "stinger"), Thornton had made his point.
11857	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"First of all, we know what he did to step up and protect our players because there were a couple of questionable hits there," said Bruins coach Claude Julien.
11858	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"He stepped up and did his job that way.
11859	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Also, what hopefully didn't go unnoticed is that he played a solid game, too.
11860	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	He was good along the wall, he was skating well, he got pucks in deep, and he played a pretty good hockey game tonight.
11861	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"You have a tendency to think of those guys as one-dimensional players, but he played more and more as the game went on because he was so reliable."
11862	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Stuart acknowledged the game is a little easier knowing Thornton is around.
11863	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Teams know what Shawn is going to bring to a game," Stuart said.
11864	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	Thornton, who has four goals and three assists in 54 games, had a slow start to the season, and missed 20 games with a foot injury, but returned in mid-December, leaner and fitter, and just as mean.
11865	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I don't think there's anybody in the league I haven't got my mitts off with," he said.
11866	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"I can take care of myself, and if that has to be done, I don't put too much thought into it.
11867	NYT_ENG_20080330.0100.LDC2009T13	"Our line did a pretty good job going out there and maybe controlling the play in the other team's end and getting some bangs in.

11872	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	A blast near a police station in northern Algeria early Sunday wounded 21 people, including six police officers, the Interior Ministry said.
11873	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The explosion occurred in Tizi-Ouzou, a northern city about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the capital, Algiers, the ministry said in a statement that gave no further details.
11874	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Witnesses said, however, that the explosion appeared to have come from a van.
11875	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but the country's al-Qaida affiliate -- al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa -- has said it was behind most recent bombings.
11876	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The group, formerly known as the GSPC, grew out of an insurgency in the 1990s.
11877	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The violence, which left as many as 200,000 dead, was prompted by the army's cancellation of 1992 legislative elections that an Islamist party was poised to win.
11878	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	The number of attacks had diminished before rising again dramatically after the GSPC in 2006 reaffirmed allegiance to al-Qaida.
11879	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Many attacks in Algeria have targeted the national security services and military, while others have struck foreigners.
11880	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	A double suicide bombing in December in Algiers killed 41 people, including 17 U.N. workers.
11881	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	In April 2007, coordinated suicide strikes against the main government offices in central Algiers and a police station killed 33.
11882	APW_ENG_20080803.0279.LDC2009T13	Tizi-Ouzou and surrounding areas are frequent sites of clashes between extremists and security forces.

11890	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In Dickens World, rat-catchers hunt vermin on London's cobbled streets, pickpockets roam the alleys -- and visitors line up for a fun-tastic water ride.
11892	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Literary purists may balk, but the attraction's backers are confident.
11893	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"Would Dickens approve?
11894	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Yes," said Thelma Grove of the Dickens Fellowship, a global association of the writer's fans.
11895	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"He loved to see people enjoy themselves, and he had a very sharp eye for the latest fad."
11896	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	In more than a dozen sprawling novels, from "The Pickwick Papers" to "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," Dickens created a rich tapestry of 19th-century England, peopled by struggling workers, aspiring clerks, jaded lawyers, ambitious orphans, rogues, runaways and thieves.
11897	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Still in print after more than a century, the books have inspired numerous film and television adaptations and a popular musical, "Oliver!"
11898	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Dickens World's backers say they are trying to capture that vibrant landscape in their 62 million pound (US$125 million
11899	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro92 million) theme park.
11900	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They insist it is "based on a credible and factual account of Charles Dickens' works and the world in which he lived."
11902	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The indoor attraction includes a central square of cobbled streets and crooked buildings, where staff dressed as pickpockets and serving wenches will mingle with the crowds.
11903	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Visitors who pay the 12.50 pounds (US$25
11904	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro18) admission charge -- 7.50 pounds (US$15
11905	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	euro11) for children -- will have the chance to see the Ghost of Christmas Past in Ebeneezer Scrooge's haunted house, be hectored by a schoolmaster at Dotheboys Hall -- the dismal school from "Nicholas Nickleby" -- and peer into the fetid cells of notorious Newgate Prison.
11906	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Tourists can also have a meal in the cafeteria, which has resisted the temptation to offer "Please, sir can I have some more?"
11907	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	2-for-1 specials.
11908	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The little ones can play in Fagin's Den, an area for preschoolers named -- alarmingly, some might think -- after the gangmaster of the band of thieves in "Oliver Twist."
11909	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	There may be a whiff of kitsch in the air at Dickens World, but its supporters include some serious Dickens buffs.
11910	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's like a dream come true," said Grove, who acted as an adviser on the project.
11911	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	She helped ensure that everything from the names on the faux shopfronts to the pharmacy offering "syrup of squirrels" was true to the Victorian period.
11912	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"People who don't know their Dickens won't know whether they are authentic or not," she said.
11913	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"But I want to be above criticism."
11914	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	At the moment, Dickens World is a work in progress.
11915	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	A planned opening this week was postponed at the last minute until May 25 due to a glitch with the "4D animatronic theater show" about Dickens' life and work.
11916	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	As journalists toured the site Wednesday, hard-hatted construction workers unfurled a banner featuring a Victorian skyline across the front of the hangar-like building in Chatham, 35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of London.
11917	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Promotional literature for Dickens World promises the "sounds and smells" of the 19th century.
11918	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	For now it sounds like a construction site and smells of sawdust and fresh paint.
11919	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's going to be a few weeks, but you can see we're getting there," Christie said.
11920	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	One aspect of the attraction is inarguably authentic -- Dickens' links with this corner of southeast England run deep.
11921	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The writer spent several years of his childhood in Chatham, where his father worked as a clerk at the Royal Navy dockyards, and he returned to the region late in life.
11922	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	The nearby marshland was memorably evoked in "Great Expectations."
11923	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Chatham's docks are long closed, and Dickens World -- sandwiched between an outlet mall and a multiplex cinema -- is part of the region's attempt at redevelopment.
11924	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Management and staff alike are embracing the project with enthusiasm.
11925	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"It's a living experience where you can go back in time," said Eddie Sampson, who plays rat-catcher and "gentle rogue" Ned Fiendish, one of several characters who wander the streets of Dickens World adding Victorian color and dispensing directions to visitors.
11926	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Sampson has taken to his work with gusto, creating an elaborate biography for his character.
11927	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	He says Ned never knew his father, fought at the battle of Waterloo, supplements rat-catching with a bit of housebreaking but has a good heart.
11928	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	"I invented the entire story," Sampson said with pride.
11929	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Managers hope the staff's enthusiasm will rub off on visitors.They want Dickens to be thought of as fun.
11930	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	Asked for the park's mission statement, Grove quotes the admirable Mr. Sleary from Dickens' "Hard Times": "People must be amused, squire, somehow.
11931	APW_ENG_20070419.0049.LDC2009T13	They can't be always a-working, nor yet they can't be always a-learning."

11944	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The latest offensive is the biggest since troops captured the town of Vakarai from the Tigers in January after weeks of heavy fighting in Batticaloa district.
11945	AFP_ENG_20070309.0334.LDC2009T13	The government has said it wants to clear the entire eastern province of Tamil Tiger rebels, and Thoppigala is the last rebel bastion in Batticaloa and Ampara districts.

11950	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At an event at this city's convention center that was billed as a round-table on his initiatives, Bush traded one-liners with a handful of workers who have had trouble getting health insurance and employers who have had difficulties providing it.
11951	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	One of them was interior designer Amy Childers, whose employer does not offer health coverage.
11952	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She said she had purchased private insurance, but dropped it last summer when she turned 35.
11953	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	At that Bush interjected: ``You don't look a day over 34.''
11954	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Most people say 22, but thanks,'' Childress responded amid laughter from the audience.
11955	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	She went on to say that she had dropped coverage because the cost went from $130 a month to $210.
11956	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	``Doesn't it make sense to change the tax code so that Amy Childers can better afford insurance?''
11957	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush asked.
11958	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	The president has proposed making medical insurance premiums deductible for all Americans, up to $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for individuals.
11959	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Currently, employers can deduct health- care premiums without limit, but individual taxpayers cannot.
11960	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Bush and his staff argue that the current system unfairly penalizes consumers who must purchase individual policies, such as the self-employed or those working for small businesses.
11961	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	They also say it creates an incentive for employers and employees to choose more expensive health care than they need, helping drive prices higher.
11963	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Democrats, who took control of both chambers of Congress last month, agree that health insurance should become more affordable for the self-employed.
11965	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	In particular, they point out that the premium deduction would not help taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their income tax returns.
11966	LTW_ENG_20070222.0120.LDC2009T13	Instead, they favor a tax credit for premiums, which they say would help all taxpayers regardless of their filing status.

11980	APW_ENG_20070814.1192.LDC2009T13	The deaths come as searing temperatures were recorded in the south-central portion of the U.S., with South Carolina and Missouri each reporting one heat-related death and Illinois blaming three deaths on the heat since Thursday.

12019	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON-Legislation that would strengthen the beleaguered Freedom of Information Act had all the makings of what Capitol Hill politicos call a "hotline bill."
12020	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote.
12021	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	More than 100 groups from across the political spectrum support it.
12022	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The House approved a companion measure by a wide margin.
12023	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Yet, the bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sits in limbo.
12024	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The reason?
12026	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that Kyl was the one who invoked a parliamentary procedure known as a "secret hold" last month to block the bill from sailing through the Senate without debate.
12027	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	With just one objection, the bill went from "hotline" status to a legislative black hole.
12028	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"I cannot overestimate the power of each U.S. senator," said Robert B. Dove, the former parliamentarian of the Senate.
12029	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	By placing the hold on the measure, Kyl is assured that nothing passes without his support, he said.
12030	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government advocates are blitzing Capitol Hill in a last- ditch effort to win approval for the measure before Congress recesses for the Fourth of July holiday-the 41st anniversary of the bill.
12032	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It really illustrates how Congress has become dysfunctional."
12033	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's hold on the Open Government Act eliminates majority rule in favor of the "idiosyncrasies of one individual," Aftergood said.
12034	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to see how government can function this way."
12035	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	So far, the open government groups -conservative and liberals included--have been unsuccessful in budging Kyl.
12036	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Cornyn-Leahy bill attempts to reduce the long backlog of FOIA requests by imposing consequences for missing the 20-day statutory deadline.
12037	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill establishes a FOIA hotline service to track requests and creates an ombudsman to settle disputes.
12041	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	To date, McConnell has not responded to a request to allow two hours of debate on the measure.
12042	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	An aide to McConnell said that the debate proposal did not permit discussion of Kyl's concerns.
12043	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Until those concerns are addressed, the bill will not move.
12044	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's a sad day in democracy when an open government bill does not see the light of day," said Rick Blum, director of the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups.
12045	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	If Kyl has concerns, those concerns should be openly debated so the bill can move forward, Blum said.
12046	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl's office did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment for this story.
12047	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	However, Kyl did list his objections to the bill in a Senate Judiciary Committee report filed in Congress.
12048	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl, a Judiciary Committee member, baffled open government groups because he objected in writing after allowing the measure to clear the committee by voice vote.
12049	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Although the goals of the Open Government Act are laudable, the bill reported by the committee has a number of flaws that must be addressed," Kyl said in his dissenting opinion.
12050	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Chief among Kyl's concerns is a provision that eliminates exemptions for disclosing government records if an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory deadline set in the law.
12051	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Kyl was concerned that the provision would inadvertently release sensitive information about national security.
12052	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The Justice Department concurs, calling it a "Draconian remedy with enormous consequences" because it would lead to the automatic release of all information with only a few narrow exceptions.
12053	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Overall, Kyl's list of concerns mirrors the Justice Department's concerns.
12054	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	And Kyl objects to a provision that would allow requesters to seek attorneys fees when they challenge denials in federal court.
12056	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The higher court ruled that a party suing the government is not entitled to attorney's fees if the government voluntarily changed its position and gave the plaintiff what he wanted.
12057	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Open government groups say this is an important provision.
12058	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	They have testified that agencies are routinely delaying the release of government records past the statutory 20-day deadline, forcing FOIA requesters to mount an expensive legal challenge to get the records.
12059	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Some have reported that they spend thousands of dollars in legal fees only to have the government cough up the records in the 11th hour.
12060	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have tried to address Kyl's concerns over the past month.
12062	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Cornyn and Leahy have eliminated the provision that would bar agencies from asserting exemption to a FOIA request if they failed to meet the 20-day deadline set by law.
12063	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	Staffers for Cornyn and Leahy say they are hopeful that Kyl will ultimately support the measure.
12065	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"He believes the Senate should act on this good government legislation as soon as possible."
12066	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law needs to be improved, Leahy said.
12067	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	The law is hampered by excessive delays and lax agency compliance, he said.
12068	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"Today, Americans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIA's 41-year history," Leahy said.
12069	NYT_ENG_20070622.0068.LDC2009T13	"This bill would help to reverse this trend and to restore the public's trust in their government."

12072	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Frank J. Ayd Jr., a psychiatrist who by studying his patients' responses to early antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs helped give birth to and nurture the field of psychopharmacology, died Monday in Baltimore.
12073	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He was 87.
12074	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The cause was complications of coronary artery disease, his daughter Loretta M. Simpson said.
12075	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd's clinical results were usually influential and sometimes stunning.
12077	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd, who received the first permit from the Food and Drug Administration to use Thorazine to treat schizophrenia, found that many of the 300 patients he treated with the drugs no longer needed hospitalization in a specialized setting and could be treated in a general hospital or nursing home.
12078	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He said 80 percent were usefully employed.
12079	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The New York Times reported that his finding had "profound economic implications," because it offered a way to cut the $1 billion the nation was then spending on mental illness.
12080	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It said many patients could receive immediate treatment and avoid long- term hospitalization.
12081	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd never doubted he was treating brain diseases.
12082	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He tested his patients' psychological, neurological and behavioral responses to new drugs, then quantified the results.
12083	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This placed him at odds with the more impressionistic traditions of psychiatry, and more in tune with the biological approach favored by many European researchers.
12084	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the founding fathers of psychopharmacology in this country," Dr. Robert L. Findling, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, said in an interview Thursday.
12085	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was there at its inception as a scientific area of focused research."
12086	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd worked at a time when there was considerably less government and academic regulation, and when clinicians were able to experiment more freely with emerging drugs to find good uses for them.
12087	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Dr. Philip G. Janicak, a professor of psychiatry at Rush University in Chicago, said in an interview that "empirical trial and error" on real patients led to many discoveries by Ayd and his contemporaries.
12088	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd contributed to more than 50 books and wrote more than 400 articles.
12089	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His "Ayd's Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology and the Neurosciences" is a standard reference.
12091	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In 1966, he established his own journal, the International Drug Therapy Newsletter.
12092	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It changed its name last year to Psychopharm Review.
12093	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Four years after his initial study, Ayd reported on a six-year study of 4,000 patients that indicated stronger new drugs in higher doses were even more effective.
12094	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It emerged that the powerful antipsychotic drugs often had powerful side effects.
12096	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He understood that all drugs on some level are poisons," DePaulo said.
12097	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"This wasn't theoretical for him.
12098	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	This was about treating the patient with something that would help them."
12099	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd also expressed concern about the many previously hospitalized mentally ill people being released without adequate support systems because of effective drugs.
12100	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Janicak said Ayd tried to find ways to "give a voice" to the often inarticulate mentally ill.
12101	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	As drugs emerged to treat depression, Ayd subjected them to equally strict analysis.
12102	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	DePaulo said Ayd tested on his patients one of the first tricyclic antidepressants, an early and important class of drugs for severe depression.
12103	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Frank Joseph Ayd Jr. was born in Baltimore on Oct. 14, 1920, the son of a pediatrician and the grandson of a pharmacist.
12105	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	His residency in pediatrics was interrupted when the Navy called him to active duty at a veterans' hospital.
12106	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	A biography prepared by the alumni association of his medical school said Ayd treated a wide array of veterans.
12107	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Some were violent, some heard voices, some could not distinguish hot from cold.
12108	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Once a patient stuffed his clothes full of newspaper and set himself on fire.
12109	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He was talking to the voice, not complaining of any pain," Ayd is quoted as saying in the biography.
12110	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"He had burns on at least 20 percent of his body.
12111	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	It fascinated me that he had no real sense of pain."
12112	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd immersed himself in psychiatry and began giving Thorazine to patients with delusions in 1952.
12113	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	The drug saved some from what then seemed to be unavoidable lobotomies.
12114	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	Ayd went on to become chief of psychiatry at Franklin Square Hospital in Baltimore from 1955 until 1962, then left to lecture in Europe.
12115	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	From 1962 to 1965, he lectured at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
12116	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	He later worked at the Taylor Manor Hospital in Ellicott City, Md., and retired in 2003.
12117	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In addition to his daughter Loretta, of Hunt Valley, Md., Ayd is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Rita Anne Corasaniti
12120	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	his sisters, Jane Morales of York, Pa., and Regina Brockmeyer of Parkville

12123	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	and 38 great-grandchildren.
12124	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	In an interview with Psychiatric Times in 2005, Ayd predicted many better drugs would be developed, but said the challenge was for doctors to learn to use them properly.
12125	NYT_ENG_20080320.0294.LDC2009T13	"Otherwise, it would be like giving a driver's license to someone who can't drive," he said.

12127	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Authorities say he used an e-mail alias, Ed Guitterrez, to communicate with at least two teenage boys.
12128	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He gave one alcohol.
12129	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He convinced them to let him take nude photos of them, and for them to take nude photos of themselves.
12130	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	And when they agreed, he mailed them payments, sometimes hidden inside computer disc cases so parents would not be suspicious.
12131	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He offered at least one of the boys $200 in exchange for oral sex.
12132	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He told them the photos would be sold in Germany.
12134	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He's being held in the Hillsborough County Jail.
12135	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The federal criminal complaint reveals more details about how authorities think Zimmerman victimized at least two teenagers and possibly more over several months' time.
12136	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman paid two teenage boys money to pose nude and masturbate for photographs between 2006 and 2007, authorities say.
12137	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	They say he took some of the photos on a Canon camera
12138	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	others were sent to Zimmerman by the teens on his cell phone.
12139	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman met one of the boys, a foster child, through his job.
12140	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	At a first appearance hearing in the Tampa federal courthouse Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen Murphy-Davis argued that Zimmerman should not be released on bail, calling him a community danger.
12141	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	She said Zimmerman was so obsessed with talking to underage boys that he used his work computer to constantly ask them to send him pornography that he could sell.
12142	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	In one message dated June 29, 2007, authorities say he wrote one of the teens: "If you can get a hold of a camera that you can use regularly whether it's a cell phone cam or regular digital, I could sell a few pics here and there every month and make you 100 to 200 a month in cash, or 50-80 depending on if they're just shirtless or naked."
12143	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	But Zimmerman's attorney, Brian Albritton of Tampa, asked Judge Mark A. Pizzo to delay a bond hearing.
12144	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He said he wanted Zimmerman's parents to be present so they can testify that their son won't skip bail if he's granted a release.
12145	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	His parents have already put up their house as collateral for $120,000 bail after he was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Feb. 2, he said.
12146	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	He returned to the jail Monday.
12147	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Zimmerman, formerly of Tallahassee, had been living with his parents in his hometown of Lakeland until he was picked up Monday on the federal charge.
12148	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	The judge agreed with Zimmerman's attorney and scheduled the bond hearing for 1:30 p.m. today.
12149	NYT_ENG_20080212.0010.LDC2009T13	Federal marshals took custody of Zimmerman in the meantime, leading him out of the courtroom Monday evening in leg shackles.

12258	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI called Monday for a peace accord in the Middle East, embroiled in a "conflict that has persisted for too long," during his New Year's Day mass at Saint Peter's Basilica.
12259	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Marking World Peace Day, he referred to "the scene of the shepherds of Bethlehem visiting Jesus in the manger," asking: "How can you not look again at the dire situation that characterizes this land where Jesus was born?"
12260	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	The 79-year-old pontiff asked: "How can you not implore with insistent prayer that the day of peace arrives as soon as possible to this region, the day when the conflict that has persisted for too long will be resolved?
12261	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"A peace accord, to be durable, must rest on respect for dignity and the rights of each person," he urged the Vatican diplomatic corps attending the mass.
12262	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"In the face of the threats to peace that are unfortunately ever- present, in the face of situations of injustice and violence that persist in many parts of the world, before continuing armed conflicts often forgotten by much of public opinion, and the danger of terrorism that disturbs peoples' serenity, it becomes more than ever necessary to work together for peace," he said.
12263	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	On December 12 Benedict sent a message to the world's 1.1 billion Catholics ahead of World Peace Day in which he condemned what he called the transformation of religion "into an ideology," and said that "a war in the name of God is never acceptable."
12264	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	The wide-ranging message also condemned violations of religious freedoms, inequality of the sexes, "disrespectful" attitudes towards the environment, religion transformed into "ideology", terrorism, human rights abuses and the spread of nuclear weapons.
12265	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"The way to ensure a future of peace for everyone is found not only in international accords for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also in the determined commitment to seek their reduction and definitive dismantling," the pope said.
12269	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad smiled at first but appeared increasingly agitated, decrying the "insults" and "unfriendly treatment."
12271	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
12272	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
12273	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"When you come to a place like this it makes you simply ridiculous," Bollinger said.
12274	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
12275	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Ahmadinejad rose, also to applause, and after a religious invocation said Bollinger's opening was "an insult to information and the knowledge of the audience here."
12276	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully," Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians.
12277	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"I should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment."

12289	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Asked about executions of homosexuals in Iran, Ahmadinejad said the judiciary system executed violent criminals and high-level drug dealers, comparing them to microbes eliminated through medical treatment.
12290	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Pressed specifically about punishment of homosexuals, he said: "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country."

12297	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Ahmadinejad's softer tone on Israel in this speech may reflect backlash in his own country.
12298	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's been widespread commentary in Iran, even on the far- right, that Ahmadinejad's position on Israel has hurt the country's diplomatic relations," said Maloney.
12299	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The fact that he was frankly unwilling to go as far as he has in the past suggests there may have been some consequences for him at home."
12301	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He told Fox News Channel that if Bollinger considers Ahmadinejad's visit an educational experience for Columbia students, "I guess it's OK with me."

12319	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	For the full year 2007, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 5.28 dollars on higher commercial aircraft deliveries, strong growth in defense earnings, productivity gains and other factors, Boeing said.
12320	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	That compared with 2006 net profit of 2.2 billion dollars and 2.85 dollars earnings per share.
12321	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Boeing said that fourth-quarter net profit rose four percent to 1.03 billion dollars from the same period in 2006, with earnings per share at 1.36 dollars.
12322	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	In 2006, profit was 989 million dollars, or 1.29 dollars a share.
12323	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The results exceeded analysts' consensus forecast for earnings per share of 5.22 dollars for 2007 and 1.32 dollars in the fourth quarter.
12324	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Revenue was virtually flat in the three months ended December 31, rising to 17.48 billion dollars from 17.54 billion in the same period a year earlier.
12325	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The Dow component, citing earlier than expected productivity gains, lifted its outlook for fiscal 2008 to earnings of between 5.70 dollars and 5.85 dollars a share.
12326	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	However, the company lowered its revenue outlook for 2008, to a range of 67 billion dollars to 68 billion, reflecting a previously disclosed delay in its new 787 Dreamliner program.
12327	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The prior forecast was for revenue of 67.5 billion dollars to 68.5 billion for the year.
12328	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	It sees operating cash flow of greater than 2.5 billion dollars for 2008, a reduction from a previous outlook of greater than three billion dollars, again because of the 787 delay.
12329	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	The company said the outlook for its defense business and in- production commercial airplane programs remains "very strong" for 2009 and it continues to expect strong earnings per share growth for the year.
12330	AFP_ENG_20080130.0403.LDC2009T13	Boeing said its total company backlog as of December 31 stood at 327 billion dollars, up 31 percent year-over-year, because of commercial airplane orders and defense program wins.

12332	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
12334	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The Beijing municipal government will quadruple the maximum premium for each person who discloses the production and sale of illegal firecrackers, raising the reward from 5,000 yuan (688 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 yuan.
12335	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The government also promised a "special reward" for those who provide information that leads to an important discovery, without elaborating.
12336	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	"The scale of the illegal firecracker business has expanded in line with the increasing demand of fireworks with the Spring Festival around the corner," said an official with the city's Firework Safety Administration Office.
12337	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	A reward of 280,000 yuan has been granted to reporters since last Spring Festival and a total of 106 people involved in 95 cases have been arrested, according to local government.
12338	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Beijing tightened control over illegal firecracker production this year by launching a crackdown on substandard firecracker workshops throughout the city.
12339	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	Checkpoints have been set up at entrances of every major highways into Beijing to cut the supply of illegal firecrackers, the official said.
12340	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The officer also said firecracker watchdogs will keep a close eye on the online black markets, which have emerged recently.
12341	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	The three major fireworks companies in Beijing joined hands to fight against fake firecrackers by cutting prices and setting up a special fund for the crackdown on illegal firework production.
12343	XIN_ENG_20080109.0045.LDC2009T13	China accounts for about 75 percent of the world's total annual firecracker production.

12345	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	BAGHDAD 2007-09-05 05:30:23 UTC
12346	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	A roadside bomb exploded on the fringes of the capital's Shiite slum of Sadr City early Wednesday, killing nine and injuring 21, police said.
12347	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	Blood stained the ground around a small crater caused by the bomb, which exploded shortly before 8 a.m. at an area where minibuses were stopped to pick up people heading to work in the eastern Baghdad neighborhood of Baladiyat, near Sadr City's al- Hamza square, a police officer said on condition of anonymity.
12348	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	Video from Associated Press Television News showed the scene strewn with broken glass and littered with people's slippers and other items.
12349	APW_ENG_20070905.0302.LDC2009T13	The injured were taken to local hospitals for treatment, some in critical condition, police said.
12352	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Stocks fell sharply in early trading Friday after Wachovia Corp. said it expects to increase quarterly loan losses, raising investor concern about the continuing credit crisis.
12353	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that credit market volatility could cause a $1.1 billion (euro0.75 billion) writedown for October alone.
12354	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The problem stems from its asset-backed securities, such as collateralized debt obligations, that have lost value on sinking investor demand.
12355	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	Investors also were rattled on speculation that Barclays PLC was about to announce a $10 billion (euro6.81 billion) writedown.
12358	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	His comments caused major indexes to fall -- contributing to a slide this week on concerns about continuing credit woes, a weakening dollar and rising oil prices.
12359	APW_ENG_20071109.0975.LDC2009T13	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 159.41, or 1.20 percent, at 13.106.88 in the opening minutes of trading.

12361	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2007-04-20 17:28:38 UTC
12362	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Finance ministers from the 13 nations that use the euro agreed Friday to use the tax windfalls they are currently enjoying to cut debt and make other changes that the EU says are needed to deal with the costs of their aging populations.
12364	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	As Europe revels in its fastest growth spurt this decade, EU officials are urging euro nations to cut their budget deficits.
12366	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The countries with higher-than-recommended debt are expected to reduce their budget deficits by at least 0.5 percent of gross domestic product a year, the euro nations said in a statement.
12367	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	This would see most of them reach a medium-term goal of putting their finances on track in 2008 or 2009 -- with 2010 set as the ultimate deadline.
12368	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"They are committed to make full use of the current economic growth and the better-than-expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies," the ministers said.
12372	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"We have noted with interest that the secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. authorities have confirmed that a strong dollar was in the interest of the U.S. economy," he said.
12375	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"I haven't had anybody knocking on my door complaining about the euro rate," he told reporters.
12376	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"The development of the rate has come so gradually to the level where it is now that it hasn't really shocked anybody or the market."
12378	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The EU's 27 finance ministers settle down to informal talks later Friday, covering a lot of ground by swapping views on what they can do to cut unemployment -- currently at its lowest level in 15 years even though it is nearly twice the U.S rate.
12380	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	They will also talk about their own experiences in reforming tax systems as some try to boost jobs by cutting labor taxes.

12384	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The junta said that the Nobel peace prize winner had refused to see Gambari, and on Sunday printed pictures in its New Light of Myanmar newspaper of his entourage waiting in vain outside her lakeside home in Yangon.
12386	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"I have read reports in the newspaper that the authorities did not reply to the two aims of Mr. Gambari's mission," Nyan Win told AFP.
12387	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"One is to release political prisoners including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the other is the dialogue between the government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi," he said, using an honorific to describe the pro-democracy leader.
12388	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	"In conclusion, Mr. Gambari's visit resulted in no improvement and was a waste of time."
12389	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to a landslide election victory in 1990, but was never allowed to govern.
12390	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The military regime instead unveiled its own "road map" to democracy and after more than a decade of delays drafted a new constitution, which was approved in a referendum in May.
12391	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	The junta says the charter will set the stage for elections in 2010, but the pro-democracy movement says the process simply enthrones the army's position in the nation it has ruled since 1962.
12393	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	He also told Gambari: "We have made all necessary arrangements for Your Excellency to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
12394	AFP_ENG_20080824.0286.LDC2009T13	Your Excellency also wished to meet with her and tried your best."

12398	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	BEIJING 2007-11-28 13:41:50 UTC
12399	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	China's rise as a global trading power obligates it to drop barriers preventing foreign competition in its domestic market and contributing to its ballooning trade surplus, the European Union's top trade official said Wednesday.
12400	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in Beijing.
12401	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year.
12402	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The weakness of China's currency, the yuan, against the euro also makes exports to China more expensive.
12403	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This is not because of any lack of competitiveness by Europe," Mandelson said.
12404	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"The EU has a surplus with the rest of the world where we are allowed to compete freely."
12405	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The commissioner's remarks, while pointed and critical, did not contain any new proposals or mention any possible EU sanctions.
12406	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes it is necessary to deliver difficult messages on trade ... but they are always constructive," he said.
12407	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright piracy.
12409	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	He also said China was "sincere and ambitious" in its efforts in protecting intellectual property rights and was giving market forces more determination over the value of the yuan.
12410	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"In China's open market, every trading partner is treated equally," he said, adding that Beijing doesn't seek to have a trade surplus with its partners.
12411	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue in March, officials said.
12415	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Discussions covered currency markets and other economic issues, although neither side indicated any breakthroughs.
12417	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the euro," Juncker told reporters.
12418	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"We do think we have to correct this obvious imbalance," Juncker said.
12422	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"China's relations with the EU date back to the early days of the European Community," Li said.
12423	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"This relationship has a history of decades, and since 1975, this relationship has come a long way."
12428	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Mugabe apparently launched his campaign for an expected run-off presidential ballot even before the official results of Saturday's election were announced, with state media portraying the opposition as divided and controlled by former colonial ruler Britain.
12431	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The police raids came a day after official results showed Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower house.
12432	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission was slow on the 60 elected seats in the Senate, releasing the first returns late Thursday that gave five seats each to the opposition and ruling party.
12433	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai tried on Thursday to reassure security chiefs who vowed a week ago not to serve anyone but Mugabe, according to a source close to the opposition leader.
12434	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But an agreed meeting with seven generals was canceled when the officers said that they had been ordered not to attend and that they would be under surveillance, the source said.
12435	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The man, who requested anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity, gave The Associated Press a copy of a letter signed by Tsvangirai outlining "MDC guarantees to the uniformed forces of Zimbabwe."
12436	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was given to the generals earlier in the day, he said.
12437	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The letter promises generous retirement packages for those unwilling to serve an MDC government.
12438	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It also promises not to take back farms given to officers under Mugabe's land reform program, except in cases in which an officer got several farms or if land was being neglected.
12440	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to give security forces time to clamp down.
12441	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The law requires a run- off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in Harare said.
12442	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	A diplomat at the U.N. Security Council, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said if the run-off was put off the council might have to take up the issue.
12444	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe has started a crackdown," Biti told The Associated Press.
12445	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"It is quite clear he has unleashed a war."
12446	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people ... including myself."
12447	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had canceled plans for a news conference.
12448	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai was arrested and severely beaten by police a year ago after a banned opposition rally.
12449	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	In a further signal of the government's hardening mood, heavily armed riot police surrounded and entered a Harare hotel housing foreign correspondents and took five away, lawyers said.
12451	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The identities of the other reporters hadn't been determined.
12452	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists expressed alarm and called for the reporters' immediate release.
12454	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	She said the other three were released.
12455	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has ruled since his guerrilla army helped force an end to white minority rule and bring about an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, but his popularity has been battered by an economic freefall that followed the often-violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms in 2000.
12456	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign, the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
12457	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back to whites.
12458	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
12459	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and agricultural production has plunged.
12460	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain and other Western nations.
12461	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But Western sanctions involve only visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of his allies.
12462	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Independent election observers say their projections based on election results posted at a representative sample of local polling stations indicate Tsvangirai won the most votes in the presidential contest, but not enough to avoid a run-off.
12463	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old president.
12464	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and suppressing the opposition.
12467	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He is not going anywhere.
12469	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Reports said leaders of the ruling party scheduled a meeting Friday to discuss the run-off.
12470	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many meetings tomorrow," but declined details.
12471	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	International concern mounted about the continuing delays in releasing official election results.
12474	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president," Annan said.
12475	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"I urge them to do the right thing ... The election results should be released now."
12476	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission said it was still receiving ballot boxes from the provinces, raising questions about where the votes had been.
12477	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition has charged Mugabe planned to rig the results, and Western election observers have accused him of stealing previous elections.
12478	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	According to official results, a total of 2,405,147 valid votes were cast in Saturday's parliamentary contests, supporting opposition charges that the voter roll of 5.9 million names had been hugely inflated with dead and fictitious people.

12482	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-09-18 11:13:23 UTC
12483	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	A trial has begun in the case of a baseball player-turned-actor accused of brutally killing a cat in a jealous rage after complaining that his ex-girlfriend cared more for the feline than she did for him.
12484	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Assistant District Attorney Leila Kermani said the cat named Norman died with broken teeth, broken ribs, a broken leg, a torn tongue, massive internal injuries including bruised lungs and a bruised liver and a chest cavity filled with blood.
12485	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant, in a fit of anger and rage, beat a defenseless animal to death," Kermani told the jury in her opening remarks Wednesday.
12486	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"The defendant killed Norman simply because he was an angry, jealous and drunken bully."
12487	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Former New York Mets baseball minor leaguer Joseph Petcka, 37, is on trial on charges of aggravated cruelty to animals for killing Norman on March 27, 2007, after a night of heavy drinking.
12488	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He faces up to two years in prison if convicted.
12490	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"This was a tragic accident," Hochbaum said.
12491	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	"It was not intentional."
12492	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum complained the district attorney's office never offered his client a plea deal.
12493	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	He said outside court he believes that was because of the publicity the case attracted and the urgings of cat fanciers.
12495	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said one night they quarreled and he began drinking heavily.
12496	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said she went to bed to avoid him but he woke her around 3 a.m. by putting his knee in her ribs and complaining that Norman had attacked him.
12497	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Altobelli, a Sports Illustrated reporter, said she left the apartment after Petcka refused to calm down.
12498	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She said Petcka had complained, "You love that cat more than you love me," but she had no idea Norman would be in danger.
12499	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	When she returned home Norman did not meet her at the door as usual.
12500	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	She found his body under her bedside table.
12501	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Petcka, a pitcher briefly in the Mets' minor league system in 1992, later appeared in a paper towel commercial and had small roles in "Sex and the City" and other television shows.
12502	APW_ENG_20080918.0529.LDC2009T13	Hochbaum said his client had more recently worked as a bartender and waiter.
12507	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders met for more than two hours at Olmert's Jerusalem residence and pledged to continue their contacts, prodded by U.S. officials to nurture their fledgling dialogue.
12509	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Israel has kept Karni closed often, citing security threats.
12512	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert and Abbas walked into the residence together.
12513	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The two leaders, flanked by their aides, sat on opposite sides of a conference table as the talks began.
12514	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Olmert smiled to TV cameras in the room as he exchanged pleasantries with Abbas.
12515	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Negotiator Mohammed Dahlan, who attended the meeting, called the summit "difficult."
12520	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	While willing to maintain ties with Abbas, Olmert says he will not conduct peace talks with a government that includes Hamas unless the group agrees to meet those demands.
12521	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Under the unity deal, the new government only agrees to "respect" past agreements, falling short of the international conditions.
12523	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Sunday's meeting followed a Feb. 19 summit in Jerusalem that also ended with little progress.
12525	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Abbas has argued the unity deal with Hamas is essential to end months of infighting.
12526	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in internal violence since last May, after Hamas defeated Fatah in legislative elections.
12527	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	The unity deal has brought a lull to the Gaza Strip, where the infighting has been concentrated, but tensions remain.
12528	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the most serious flare-up of fighting since the agreement, gunmen from Hamas and Fatah exchanged fire early Sunday in northern Gaza.
12530	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	Hamas vowed revenge.
12532	APW_ENG_20070311.0678.LDC2009T13	In the past, Israel has rejected the plan's call for a full withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem.

12537	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua)
12538	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The former board chairman of the Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd. was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve after being convicted on five counts of corruption, including bribery.
12540	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	In addition to his convictions, Zhang was also stripped of political rights for life and all his personal property was confiscated.
12541	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	The five counts involved 50 million yuan, but there was no breakdown for each count.
12543	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Public Security has asked Canada to extradite Gao, who fled after sending the funds to Canada in 2005, and another suspect, Li Dongzhe.
12546	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of misappropriating public funds.
12547	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd, a publicly listed company, said two days later in a public announcement that 293 million yuan of its funds were missing from the BOC's Hesong Street Branch.
12549	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang's first trial commenced at the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City in September 2006.
12551	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.
12552	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang pleaded innocent in the BOC case in a second trial held in January this year.
12553	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Cycling: Landis blasts USADA over sample re-test bid
12557	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at a request last December from USADA attorney Travis Tygart for more tests on "B" portions of cleared "A" samples from Labaratoire National Depistage de Dopage's (LNDD) laboratory at Chatenay-Malabry.
12558	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis was upset at the notion of retesting samples he considers tainted at the very center whose procedures he is challenging in an appeal of his doping positive to USADA.
12559	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	That hearing is set for May 14.
12560	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"They got it wrong the first time and they're trying to get it wrong again," Landis said in the statement.
12561	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I am very concerned regarding the LNDD's handling of my samples over the last six months as well as the Anti-Doping Agencies' complete and consistent disregard of their own rules and procedures.
12562	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"With the steady stream of news flow regarding serious problems at the LNDD, it's impossible to understand USADA's motivation for this move unless it's simply another way to drain my resources in this fight to clear my name.
12563	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"My message to USADA and the LNDD is this testing should have been done right the first time."
12564	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis argues his stage 17 positive came from a contaminated sample that LNDD continued to process in violation of World Anti- Doping Agency protocols.
12565	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I have not taken testosterone or any other performance enhancing substance," Landis said.
12566	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis has agreed not to race in France this season, giving him no chance to defend the crown that could be stripped from him if the positive dope test stands.
12567	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"I'm 100 percent confident that if best practice in process and technology were applied to testing my sample back in July, I would be racing my bike this season," Landis said.
12568	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	While critics could argue that if Landis had nothing to hide, he has no reason to object to more testing of samples that were clear, Landis argues the re-test move would violate WADA and International Cycling Union rules.
12569	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's request for further analysis of "B" samples is in clear violation the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code and Union Cyclist International (UCI) rules and is unprecedented in athlete anti-doping cases," the statement said.
12570	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA's illegal initiative would also cause the Landis team to expend unnecessary resources to halt a clearly prohibited activity - resources that have already been unduly and unfairly stretched by the ADA's unethical approach to their pursuit of unsubstantiated allegations against Landis."
12571	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis' legal team claims to have been denied full access to details of his results "and has no reason to believe that it would be provided with the results of any further tests", the statement said.
12572	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	Landis attorney Maurice Suh expects it would not receive documentation from any proposed re-testing.
12573	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"Illegal re-testing of these cleared samples is designed to further injure Floyd by costing him and his team substantial time and money, more deeply invading his privacy and destroying evidence that may later on be valuable in his defense," Suh said.
12574	AFP_ENG_20070209.0733.LDC2009T13	"USADA continues to dramatically demonstrate that they have no interest in providing Floyd with a fair and just outcome to this process."

12586	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Police officers were taped joking about a dying, homeless Guatemalan immigrant after he was found on the side of a deserted road in their suburban town, a television station reported.
12587	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	"You wanna hear something really funny?
12588	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	... He's alive," a Bedford police officer tells a sergeant on a taped phone call aired Thursday on WCBS-TV.
12589	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The two go on to marvel -- with the officer chuckling -- that Rene Perez had apparently revived himself temporarily after authorities thought him dead on April 28, 2007.
12590	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	The television station said Perez died an hour after the officers' taped exchange.
12591	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez had had a series of encounters with police in Bedford and neighboring Mount Kisco that night.
12592	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A Mount Kisco police officer has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges in Perez's death.
12593	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors say the officer drove the drunken Perez to Mount Kisco, dealt him a deadly blow to the abdomen and left him to die.
12594	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	In a later phone call to another Bedford sergeant, after Perez' death, a Bedford officer sings the title line from the 1966 hit record "Walk Away Renee" by The Left Banke.
12596	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He said he could not comment further on the ongoing case.
12598	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Mateo called for the suspension of the officers involved.
12599	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the Mount Kisco officer charged in the case, George Bubaris, did not immediately return a telephone call late Thursday.

12602	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	a hearing is set for next week.
12603	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Perez, 42, an illegal immigrant, had a history of making drunken calls to the police emergency dispatcher.
12604	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	He called Mount Kisco police complaining of stomach pain on April 28, and police records show Bubaris reported there was no need for further action.
12605	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits filed on behalf of Perez' family maintain that Mount Kisco and Bedford made a practice of "dumping" each other's undesirables in the neighboring town.
12606	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Bedford police had taken Perez into Mount Kisco hours before Bubaris allegedly took him to Bedford.
12607	APW_ENG_20080118.1269.LDC2009T13	Through a translator, Perez' brother, Anival Perez, called the Bedford officers' taped conversations "unrespectful."

12621	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	BEIJING
12624	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Initial reports from state news media on Wednesday stated that one construction worker died, another was injured and two more were trapped in a landslide on Tuesday at a railroad construction site in Badong County, upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.
12625	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But on Friday morning, Xinhua, the official news agency, released a short report saying that rescuers had discovered a passenger bus crushed beneath the rubble.
12626	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	It said "about 30 more people" were believed dead.
12627	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	"Rescuers said there were no signs of life on the bus," Xinhua reported.
12628	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The bus apparently left Shanghai on Monday.
12629	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	There has been no news about the two trapped workers.
12630	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	As yet, it is not certain what caused this particular landslide, but scientists and critics have been warning for years that the reservoir created by the Three Gorges Dam might further destabilize hillsides, causing landslides and possibly even earthquakes.
12631	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Officials countered that the design of the project accounted for such concerns.
12634	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	At the meeting, a vice mayor from the city of Chongqing said the shoreline of the reservoir had collapsed in 91 places as water levels continued to slowly rise.
12635	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	A day after the forum, Xinhua released a short article disclosing the official concerns.
12636	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	The article caused an immediate sensation, given that officials had rarely expressed misgivings about the signature project.
12638	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	China Daily, the official English-language newspaper, ran a banner article across the front page beneath the headline: "Dam Impact 'Less Than Predicted.' "
12639	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Landslides had been a problem in the Three Gorges area before construction of the dam.
12640	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Dam officials say they have made improvements in stabilizing the region's geology in recent years and that landslides are not a major problem.
12641	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	But peasants in many villages say the number of landslides have increased since the reservoir began filling up.
12642	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Several local officials have said that pressure from the rising water is a factor in many, if not all, the recent landslides.
12643	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Currently, water levels are at about 500 feet.
12644	NYT_ENG_20071123.0006.LDC2009T13	Planners intend to raise water levels to 575 feet by 2009.

12647	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Strong opposition to the candidacy of Barack Obama in Arkansas may have helped conservatives pass a measure blocking the adoption of children by unmarried couples.
12648	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The measure, which voters overwhelmingly approved Tuesday and which prevents unmarried cohabitating couples from adopting or fostering children, won strong support from conservatives, exit polls found.
12649	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	The ban affects all unmarried couples but was written with the intent of preventing gay couples from raising children in Arkansas.
12650	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	Unlike most states, Arkansas shifted to the right politically in this election.
12652	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"I think white Arkansas Democrats felt cross-pressured in this race," said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College.
12653	NYT_ENG_20081108.0055.LDC2009T13	"They didn't want to vote for what they viewed as Bush's third term, but they also couldn't bring themselves to vote for Barack Obama.

12713	AFP_ENG_20071207.0057.LDC2009T13	An Ebola patient died in western Uganda on Friday, bringing the toll to 23, an official said, amid fears that the virulent strain had spread to the eastern part of the country.
12714	AFP_ENG_20071207.0057.LDC2009T13	The patient died in Bundibugyo district, the outbreak's epicentre where hundreds are under observation for possible infection, said Sam Okware, a health ministry official heading the battle against the disease.

12721	AFP_ENG_20071207.0057.LDC2009T13	Because of its scanty history, scientists have concluded that the strain is somewhat containable because it kills its victims faster that it can spread to new hosts.

12730	XIN_ENG_20080421.0107.LDC2009T13	Addressing reporters on the same day, The FAO chief had expressed confidence that food production could be doubled in the world within the next five years, "if governments marshaled the prerequisite political will."
12731	XIN_ENG_20080421.0107.LDC2009T13	The issue of soaring food prices, which has already led to riots in a number of African, Asian and Caribbean countries, has captured the imagination of the world community, with many leaders concurring that it represented a serious threat to world security.
12732	XIN_ENG_20080421.0107.LDC2009T13	Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director General Dominique Strauss- Kahn had called on world countries to halt the production of biofuels from food crops, saying that it was "posing a real moral problem" as it had resulted in a food crisis in poor countries.
12733	XIN_ENG_20080421.0107.LDC2009T13	Earlier on, UN Special Rapporteur for the Right to Food Jean Ziegler had argued that the mass production of biofuels was "a crime against humanity" because of its impact on the soaring world food prices.

12746	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the first attempt.
12747	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
12748	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	None of the plants was identified.
12750	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer provided the results to Kohl in a letter for a hearing on the beef recall Tuesday.
12752	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use of electronic stunning prods

12755	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for insufficient stunning.
12756	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter.
12757	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	While not a violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
12758	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The problems uncovered by the audit have been corrected, Schafer told Kohl at Tuesday's hearing.
12759	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added.
12760	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We have helped train our inspectors to observe while being unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
12761	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
12762	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	I am working with USDA to gather more information about these audits and to find ways to ensure that the problems being discovered do not continue."
12763	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Schafer told reporters after the hearing that based on the audit's findings, he does not believe the problems at Westland/Hallmark were systemic.
12765	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"But our continuing investigation will give us the full answer to that."
12767	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.
12768	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said.
12769	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"This letter is not reassuring.
12770	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	This confirms there are major problems with the inspection program and inadequacies with the law."
12772	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California video released in January truly was an anomaly."

12794	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But with two days to think about it, Torre admonished Rodriguez on Friday.
12795	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"It's probably something he shouldn't have done," Torre said before the Yankees played the Boston Red Sox.
12796	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"But it's over with.
12797	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	I don't sense he's going to do it again.
12798	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Just the reaction probably told him that.

12800	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	It was probably inappropriate to do it at the time he did it.
12801	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	But you can't change it, unfortunately."
12802	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told Rodriguez on the field that he had made a bush league play, something more appropriate for a Little Leaguer, and repeated those assertions to reporters after the game.
12803	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Several other Blue Jays were furious at Rodriguez.
12804	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"They were angry, no question," Torre said.
12805	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I can't say I blame them."
12806	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Torre, who gave a lukewarm defense of Rodriguez immediately after Wednesday's game, said he spoke with Rodriguez that night about the play.
12807	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"I sensed from our conversation it won't happen again," Torre said.
12808	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez did not make himself available to reporters after Torre's comments, but the Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson defended him.
12810	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"If it's not Alex Rodriguez, it's not a story," Jackson said.
12811	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Jackson broke up a potential double play in the 1978 World Series when he froze on the basepaths and turned his hip into a throw.
12812	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	He said he did it so the ball would not hit him in a more sensitive spot, but he also said that, like Rodriguez, he was denounced instead of praised for a play that helped his team.
12813	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"No over ever gave me credit for making a smart play, because I wasn't in favor," Jackson said.
12814	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	"They said it was a cheap shot.
12815	NYT_ENG_20070602.0004.LDC2009T13	Now, A-Rod's not in favor.

12845	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	Real Madrid midfielder Emerson has denied refusing to appear as a substitute during the Champions League match with Bayern Munich.

12850	APW_ENG_20070222.0616.LDC2009T13	I'm a professional and I have never refused to play a match and particularly not with Capello, whom I have known for many years and who has known me," Emerson was quoted as saying by sports daily Marca on Thursday.

12857	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Special to The Hartford Courant
12858	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty-four years have passed since I first went to a Lou Reed concert.
12859	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	In 1974, I went to the exquisite Waterbury Palace Theater.
12860	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Pulsating strobe lights reflected Reed's disposition.
12862	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Three decades later, it's all changed.
12863	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Hindsight makes me realize that concerts were not just a teenage thing in the '70s.
12864	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I was on the cusp of an audience embracing the rise of an unparalleled art form, the rise of the rock 'n' roll concert.
12865	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Now, the music's almost over.
12866	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts might squeeze out another decade, but in the scope of things, that's nearing the end.
12867	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	I've been there, from the smoke-filled general admission arenas where armband-wearing employees led the too-stoned to a backroom cot, to today's reserved seating shows where one flash of a digital camera gets you scolded by security.
12868	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From bowling alley music halls to stadiums of 40,000.
12869	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From Bic lighter encores to open cell-phone salutes.
12870	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	From $7.50 a ticket to $75 tickets.
12871	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It's all been part of a living museum.
12872	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Rock concerts are an invaluable art form.
12873	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They're exhibitions of the masters, music as their medium, the stage their easel.
12874	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	If I could collect them like paintings, I would.
12875	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The closest I come to collecting is buying tickets
12876	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	the odd thing is that the tickets are for the same bands I saw 30 years ago.
12877	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and, recently, my four tickets for Lou Reed.
12878	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Though the music still rocks, perhaps even more than in the past, the musicians have become pensive with decades of life behind them.
12879	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed -- appearing at the Calvin Theatre in Northhampton, Mass. -- sang of the guardian angel who saved him rather than of the white heat that once ran through his veins.
12880	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	At the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach this summer, Stevie Nicks' first words were "Through good grace, you're here.
12881	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	When we get older, we learn to appreciate what we have more."
12882	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller closed his outdoor concert asking us to "Take care of each other."
12883	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Most of them call for peace.
12884	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So, there is a sadness to the concerts this time around.
12885	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Time is no longer on their side.
12886	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Each tour now may be that band's last.
12887	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	It is just that sense of loss that implies rock music is nearly done, approaching historical status.
12888	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My 18-year-old daughter discovered the recent Lou Reed concert in a local arts newspaper and insisted that we attend.
12890	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	To this day, we're sorry.
12891	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	What if we never get another chance?
12892	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So my daughter's logic, rightly so, was that someday Mr. Reed won't be around to perform.
12893	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We both know that day will be sooner now, rather than later.
12894	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Thirty years of his concerts no longer unfurl before us.
12895	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The clock is ticking, not only for Reed, but for a generation of venerated musicians.
12896	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	So we buy tickets to beat that clock.
12897	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Our summer lined up with bands that may never tour again.
12898	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.
12899	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Stevie Nicks.
12900	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Lou Reed.
12901	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Steve Miller.
12902	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band.
12903	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Ringo's actual voice, his message of peace and love, reached our ears.
12904	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	My children heard a Beatle sing.
12905	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will not.
12906	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Their children will never see Mr. Reed, alone in the spotlight, singing about Holly's hitchhiking transformation.
12907	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will not watch Mike Love consider if everybody had an ocean, surfboards set on the stage, Mr. Love giving the peace sign.
12908	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	They will never see Mick Jagger insist he likes it, this thing called rock 'n' roll, as he struts past Keith Richards on a seven-story stage.
12909	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Liza Minnelli will never invite their children to "Come, hear the music play."
12910	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	We are hard-pressed to fathom 2008's contemporary artists touring three decades from now, never mind drawing sell-out audiences.
12911	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	This millennium's music has no Billy Joel defining the king and queen of the prom.
12913	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no John Fogerty penning scathing lyrics against the war.
12914	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Has no Freddie Mercury rocking out stadium anthems.
12915	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Steve Miller slipping us into the future.
12916	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	No Beatle.
12917	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every rock concert, now, is a tribute to the music.
12918	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert now is a gift.
12919	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	Every concert takes another little piece of my heart with the final encore.
12920	LTW_ENG_20080802.0036.LDC2009T13	The imminence is palpable, of the exhibit closing, of the stage lights going dark.

12947	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't wish what I going through on anyone, my worst enemy," Stevens said Tuesday morning in the Capitol.
12950	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision was part of the post-election congressional tableaux as Senate Democrats and Republicans re-elected their current leadership teams for the first two years of the Obama administration.
12951	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	House Democrats met to make Rep. Nancy Pelsoi of California their candidate for speaker and essentially kept their leadership intact as well, with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland remaining majority leader.
12953	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But a pragmatic dynamic was at work as well.
12954	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Having added seven new senators to their side, Democrats want to avoid driving Lieberman to the Republican fold.
12955	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Even though they fell short of the 60 needed to cut off filibusters, the Democrats are aiming to keep their majority as large as possible next year when, for the first time since 1994, they have control of Congress and the White House.
12956	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Two other Senate seats, in Minnesota and Georgia, have yet to be decided as well.
12958	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Democrats voted 42-13 to let Lieberman stay at the helm of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs while removing him from the Environment and Public Works Committee, where he led a subcommittee.
12960	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers who attended the session said that Lieberman openly discussed the political and personal hurt he experienced when many of his colleagues campaigned against him after he lost a Democratic Senate primary in 2006 before winning re-election as an independent.
12961	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After the vote, he expressed some remorse for his campaign comments but noted the resolution did not chastise him directly for backing McCain, who returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to resume life as a senator.
12962	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	Lieberman, who only eight years ago was the party's nominee for vice president, said there were statements he could have made "more clearly.

12968	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	They said that stripping the chairmanship was only fitting.

12971	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The reluctance of the senators to move forcefully against their colleagues illustrates again how cautious senators are when it comes to punishing their own.
12972	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	After being thwarted repeatedly by Republican resistance in the past two years, Senate Democrats were unwilling to lose the support of Lieberman on most domestic policy issues, particularly after Obama had urged that Lieberman be allowed to remain in the Democratic fold.
12973	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The resolution noted that Lieberman's vote gave Democrats the majority in 2007 and that he voted almost 100 percent of the time with the party on key procedural issues.
12975	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	"But I also believe that if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk about of here saying, 'Boy, did we get even'?

12977	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	The decision touched off attacks on the Democrats by liberal and progressive groups and on the Internet, where critics accused Democrats of weakness in their posture against Lieberman, who they have branded a traitor to Democrats.
12978	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	But senators pointed to statements by the Obama campaign in support of Lieberman as justification for their decision.
12982	NYT_ENG_20081118.0192.LDC2009T13	In the House, Democrats gathered for the leadership elections and bid farewell to Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., who is relinquishing his No. 4 post in the party hierarchy to become chief of staff to Obama.

13022	XIN_ENG_20071225.0010.LDC2009T13	Tapan Chowdhury said the IAEA, the global nuclear watchdog, also asked Bangladesh to send a delegation to expedite the process of installing a nuclear power plant with its assistance.

13051	AFP_ENG_20070830.0051.LDC2009T13	No official events are planned in Paris, but well-wishers have left dozens of bouquets and photo tributes at the foot of a sculpture of a giant golden flame above the tunnel, which has become an ad-hoc shrine since her death.

13074	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago, it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
13075	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
13076	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a brochure.
13078	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot spring," Iwanaga, 21, said.
13079	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"They really wanted us to come here."
13080	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of higher education in Asia, but today its universities are scrambling to find new ways to attract students.
13081	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Years of falling birthrates have rapidly shrunk the population of young Japanese, leaving more universities unable to find enough students to fill their classrooms and campuses.
13083	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But it has only recently begun to affect higher education.
13085	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	As a result, according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers' children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to 1.3 million this year.
13086	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Estimates show it dropping to 1.21 million in two years.
13088	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Roughly half of college-age Japanese attend universities.
13089	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Only three universities have gone bankrupt for lack of students.
13093	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"We need to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting the education of their students."
13094	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of prospective students, such as foreigners and "silver students," retirees who study for fun.
13097	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has also halved tuition to 590,000 yen, or about $5,000.
13098	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The school also created a "celebrity business" major to train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative pursuits like music, rather than the "salaryman" positions sought by their parents' generation.
13101	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Many fear that this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards to attract more students.
13102	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a four-year break before entering the work force, some administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish.
13104	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities realize they actually have to educate their students," Hamana said.
13108	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign, including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
13109	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Half of the classes are taught in English.
13110	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university is also unusual in Japan because it has a full-fledged, American-style career office to help students find jobs.
13111	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The university has been rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
13113	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hagi converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year university in 1999 with grandiose plans of becoming the region's top school.
13114	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	But from the beginning, it failed to attract its annual capacity of 300 freshmen.
13115	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	The campus became increasingly empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to just three in 2006, the school said.
13117	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Next, it hired a top professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
13118	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for bankruptcy in 2005.
13120	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"Problem was, there just weren't a lot of new students to be found."
13122	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	Hatachi said the new focus should make it more competitive because in rapidly graying Japan, care for the elderly is one of the few guaranteed growth markets for young job seekers.
13123	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education," he said.
13124	NYT_ENG_20070622.0017.LDC2009T13	"A university has to be a place where students think they can learn what they need."
13127	AFP_ENG_20080730.0118.LDC2009T13	"The repeated scathing comments about the independent media can only aggravate the climate of hostility between the press and government," RSF Africa said in a statement from Dakar.

13136	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Inspired by Neil Young and Radiohead, Michael Moore will release his new film online and for free.
13137	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The film, "Slacker Uprising," follows Moore's 62-city tour during the 2004 election to rally young voters.
13139	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	An official announcement of the film is planned for Friday.
13141	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Instead, Moore opted for a symbol of gratitude to his fans as he approaches the 20th anniversary of his first film, 1989's "Roger &amp
13142	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Me."
13143	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"I thought it'd be a nice way to celebrate my 20th year of doing this," Moore said.
13144	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"And also help get out the vote for November.
13145	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	I've been thinking about what I want to do to help with the election this year."
13146	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The 97-minute long "Slacker Uprising" will be the first major film to be released in such a way.
13147	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Last December, "Jackass 2.5" was streamed online and for free, but that was only a collection of left over material from "Jackass 2."
13148	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Companies like ClickStar, which Morgan Freeman co-founded, have made films still in theaters -- such as 2006's "10 Items or Less" -- digitally available for purchase or rental.
13149	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Experimentation in distribution has been more common in the music industry, where the Internet has significantly damaged traditional business models.
13150	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore took notice when Radiohead last year released their seventh album, "In Rainbows," online with optional pricing.
13151	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	In 2006, Neil Young streamed his anti-war album "Living With War" for free before its standard release -- now a more common practice.
13152	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	If history is any measure, "Slacker Uprising" could have made a decent sum in theaters.
13153	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	His last two films, "Sicko" ($24 million) and "Fahrenheit 9/11" ($119 million) are two of the three highest grossing documentaries ever.
13154	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore said that "Slacker Uprising" cost about $2 million to make and that he will end up paying about $1 million out of his pocket.
13155	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Neither he nor the distributor, Brave New Films, plan to profit from the release.
13156	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	The director's last film, "Sicko," leaked online and was downloaded illegally in large numbers.
13157	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	He says this download, offered by BlipTV, will be high-resolution and far better than "YouTube quality."
13158	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	To receive the download, people can sign up at SlackerUprising.com.
13159	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A "Night of a Thousand House Parties" is planned for Oct. 4, when local neighborhood screenings are hoped to be scheduled.
13160	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	A DVD will be released Oct. 7.
13161	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore last week released a paperback book, "Mike's Election Guide 2008" and is currently working on a movie for theatrical release next year.
13162	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	That film is expected to examine America as an empire, but the director declined to discuss any details about it.
13163	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	For now, Moore hopes "Slacker Uprising" will help spur young people to vote this November.
13164	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	After more than 20 million 18 to 29 -year-olds cast ballots in 2004 (an 11 percent increase from 2000), he's hoping even greater numbers of "slackers" vote this year.
13165	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	Moore readily acknowledges this a film for Democrats.
13166	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"This film, really isn't for anybody other than the choir," said Moore.
13167	APW_ENG_20080904.1055.LDC2009T13	"But that's because I believe the choir needs a song to sing every now and then."

13174	APW_ENG_20080414.0477.LDC2009T13	Georg Milbradt, 63, has been under pressure since the bank, the only state-run bank in the former East Germany, announced last August that it was threatened by its exposure in the U.S. market.
13175	APW_ENG_20080414.0477.LDC2009T13	The public-sector Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg swiftly stepped in to prevent SachsenLB from going under, but the controversy continued.

13180	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	More than $300 million (euro225.6 million) in previously unpaid insurance claims were awarded to 48,000 Holocaust survivors for harm they suffered during World War II, an international commission said Tuesday.
13181	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	The International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims concluded its claims and appeals process after a worldwide outreach campaign began in 1998 to ensure that insurance companies fulfilled their obligations.
13182	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Its review was able to match those survivors submitting claims with more than 70 European insurance companies and businesses.
13183	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	"I fully recognize that no amount of compensation can redress the suffering inflicted during the Holocaust," said Lawrence Eagleburger, who chaired the commission.
13184	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, the panel "has achieved its goal of bringing a small measure of justice to those who have been denied it for so long."
13185	APW_ENG_20070320.1432.LDC2009T13	The group was charged with expeditiously addressing, at no cost to claimants, unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims.

13201	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"China should be commended, and an expanded sustainable forestry will both offset carbon emissions and produce development dividends," said Oxley, adding that China's efforts have largely been ignored at the climate talks in Poznan.
13202	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	According to a new report by World Growth, China pledged in 2006 to expand the country's forest area to 20 percent of total land by 2010, which would increase the size of China's total carbon sink by 50 million tons of carbon dioxide -- roughly enough to offset the emissions of the entire country of Sweden for a whole year.
13203	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China's approach to climate change is fully consistent with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which encourages attention to climate change adaptation.
13204	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	China is seeking to improve energy efficiency to reduce emission rates and it is also expanding its forest sinks, which are tangible measures to reduce emission rates, Oxley said.
13205	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"At the same time, given the need for China to continue to raise living standards and develop the economy, an overall increase in emissions for some time is yet inevitable," he added.
13206	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	"This is understandable, China has also indicated that a key aim is to adapt to the impacts of climate change."
13207	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	.
13209	XIN_ENG_20081210.0194.LDC2009T13	Yet it is still being ignored by negotiators in industrialized economies.
13213	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition also said it was the wrong time to discuss key legislation that would enable Japan to resume its naval mission supporting the "war on terror," citing scandals which involve the defence ministry and the finance minister.
13216	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"This symbolises nationwide politics," he said.
13218	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Abe, an outspoken conservative, abruptly quit after the opposition refused his calls to extend a naval mission supporting the US-led "war on terror" in Afghanistan.

13220	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	He is in the midst of a battle with the opposition to restart the naval deployment.
13224	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"But we are not analysing it at the level of national politics.
13225	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	I don't think this will affect politics at the national level," he said.
13226	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	In the election, Kunio Hiramatsu, a former television newscaster supported by the opposition, defeated the LDP-backed incumbent Junichi Seki, who was first elected in 2003.
13227	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The election was nominally non-partisan.
13229	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition has also gone on the offensive over a growing scandal in which the recently retired top bureaucrat at the defence ministry acknowledged that a military contractor treated him to gifts, dinner and more than 200 golf trips.
13230	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	The opposition, which controls the upper house, reiterated that it would probe the scandal before taking up a bill on the naval mission.
13232	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"The ruling bloc may need to extend the current session again," he said.
13233	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	"The collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and business is just being divulged in the defence ministry scandal.
13234	AFP_ENG_20071119.0529.LDC2009T13	Naturally, now is not the time to discuss the new anti-terror legislation," Hatoyama said.
13236	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Germany on Wednesday pledged half a billion euros (785 million dollars) to help defend threatened forests and called on others to join its effort as a UN conference on biodiversity engaged top gear.
13238	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	"The federal government, between 2009 and 2012, will earmark an additional amount of 500 million euros," Merkel told the meeting.
13239	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	"We want to use this money in those areas where forests and other ecosystems are under threat and to find quick solutions for conserving them."
13241	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	The three-day "high-level" section of the conference is gathering 87 ministers, with the goal of crafting a new global deal on preserving Earth's wildlife.
13242	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Some 6,000 representatives from 191 countries attended the meeting, launched 11 days earlier.
13243	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Participants at the conference are hoping to establish a roadmap towards negotiating, by 2010, an "Access and Benefit Sharing" regulatory framework governing access to genetic resources and sharing the benefits from their use.

13248	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Group of Eight environment ministers met in Kobe, Japan, earlier this week, issuing a joing statement acknowledging the fundamental importance of biodiversity and spelling out their support for the Millennium Development Goal of reaching a "significant reduction" in species loss by the end of this decade.
13249	AFP_ENG_20080528.0524.LDC2009T13	Greenpeace's Martin Kaiser praised Merkel for sending "a very strong and important signal" for reaching a strong agreement in Bonn.

13251	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	EU raises 2008 eurozone inflation forecast to 3.2 pct from 2.6 pct
13254	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	In the 27-nation European Union, the commission forecast inflation would reach 3.6 percent this year, instead of the 2.9 percent previously expected, but stuck to its estimate for 2.0 percent economic growth.
13255	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	"Economic growth is moderating in the EU and euro area and the current, imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.
13256	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	The commission predicted that consumer prices growth would peak in the second quarter and cool down over the remainder of the year and into 2009, bringing inflation in the eurozone down to 2.2 percent next year.
13257	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Driven ever higher by record commodities prices, 12-month eurozone inflation hit 3.6 percent in March, the highest since the 1999 launch of the shared currency and well above the European Central Bank's comfort level of just under 2.0 percent.
13258	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	While oil prices flirt with records close to 120 dollars a barrel, the EU executive said futures contracts suggested food prices would rise 54 percent in the first half of 2008 before stabilising.
13259	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, not all was doom and gloom in the commission's report with regional economic powerhouse Germany expected to perform better than the last time Brussels made forecasts in February.
13260	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Europe's biggest economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent this year, rather than the 1.6 percent the commission predicted in February.
13262	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead to 2009, the commission predicted that economic activity would pick up towards the end of the year to about 2.0 percent in the eurozone at an annualised rate.
13263	AFP_ENG_20080428.0389.LDC2009T13	However, for the whole of 2009, it forecast eurozone growth would slow to 1.5 percent while activity in the overall EU economy would ease to 1.8 percent.
13269	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The two soldiers had carried out their duty "without grumbling or doubting", said Plavins.
13271	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	"The whole of Latvia is in mourning today," said Plavins.
13272	AFP_ENG_20070104.0235.LDC2009T13	The sobs of grieving friends and family of the fallen filled the historic church as the caskets of the two soldiers were carried down the aisle by a guard of honour.

13286	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	There is nothing concrete," an African negotiator told AFP.
13288	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The C4 group has since 2003 been fighting for the cotton issue to be included in the Doha Round of World Trade Organisation negotiations.
13289	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The group wants industrialised countries, particularly the United States, to lower domestic subsidies that the African nations say weigh down world cotton prices and penalise poorer countries.
13290	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	They were assured that the issue would be treated "ambitiously, expeditiously and specifically" by WTO trade partners in 2004.
13291	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	But the African negotiator said Sunday that there had been "no advances" in the talks with Schwab.
13292	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	"The US promised they would do more on cotton than on the rest of agriculture, but they don't want to announce anything right now," he said.
13293	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	"There weren't even any signals at this stage on what figures they might propose," he added.
13294	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	The group wants to see subsidies cut by 82.2 percent in the US, a figure included in a negotiating text that is forming the basis of discussions on a new free-trade pact.
13296	AFP_ENG_20080727.0050.LDC2009T13	But the African diplomat said market access was not the issue, stating: "What we want is for them to relieve us of the burden of (their) subsidies."

13309	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Relatives back home say Utah gunman Sulejman Talovic's early life in the Balkans was marked by war, poverty and upheaval: the family fled by foot from Serb forces when Talovic was just 4 years old, and his grandfather was killed by a Serb bomb.
13310	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Talovic was just a toddler when the war broke out in Bosnia in 1992.
13311	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Serb troops laid siege to the tiny hamlet of Talovici in northeastern Bosnia, bombing it for a year before finally overrunning the village in March 1993, relatives said Thursday.
13312	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"We were besieged and bombed day and night.
13313	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We couldn't stick our noses out of the house," recalled cousin Redzo Talovic, 59.
13314	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"At first we all hid from the shells, but later we gave up on life, didn't care and started coming out.
13315	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	That's how later the shelling killed 20 people in the village," Rezdo Talovic said.
13316	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Sabira Talovic fled on foot with Sulejman, his three sisters and his grandfather, while her husband, Suljo, hid in the mountains with other men from the village, relatives said.
13317	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Many left the village, only a few made it," said Murat Avdic, 54, a friend of the family.
13318	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The mother and children, exhausted, desperate and hungry, made their way the to nearby enclave of Srebrenica -- also besieged, bombed and crowded with starving families like the Talovics.
13319	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	One of the bombs killed Sulejman's grandfather but relatives say despite the conditions, they were a quiet, gentle and caring family.
13320	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Those were really nice people, never argued with anybody about anything.
13321	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	During the war, they shared the little food they had with others," said Sefko Talovic, 59, a distant relative.
13322	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"His father helped other injured people flee when the village fell although he himself was injured too," he said.
13323	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Later that year, Sabira Talovic and the four children were among the displaced rescued by the U.N.
13324	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	They made their way to the government-controlled town of Tuzla, impoverished but safe.
13325	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I remember they arrived in 1993 on an overloaded U.N. truck and settled here in an empty house the owner had left," said former neighbor Zijad Cerkic in the Tuzla suburb of Bare.
13326	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"They were very poor, they had lost everything, but they were very nice and quiet people," Cerkic said, recalling the young Sulejman as "a good child, always with a smile on his face."
13328	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The massacre of civilians was Europe's worst since World War II.
13329	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The family finally reunited in Tuzla later that year when a peace agreement brought an end to the war.
13330	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	But the accord divided up the country, putting their native Talovici in the Serb-controlled half of the country -- and they did not dare return, relatives said.
13332	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	In 1998, they joined family members already living in Utah.
13334	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I spoke to his father on the phone almost every month since they left to the United States, and he said for the first time they have a decent life, they have a home, jobs and they were happy," said Redzo Talovic.
13336	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	The news came as a shock to his extended family back in Talovici.
13337	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"When I heard his name on TV, I fainted.
13338	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	I still can't believe what he did," said a cousin, Mina Talovic, 54.
13339	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"I remember him as a happy little boy sitting in my lap."
13340	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"Not in my wildest dreams could I have presumed Sulejman killed those people.
13341	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	When I heard his name, I fell from the sofa," Redzo Talovic said.
13342	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	"What got into him?
13343	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	This is what we are all asking ourselves.
13344	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	We are all in shock," he said.
13345	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Avdic speculated that the teen had been traumatized by what he saw and experienced as a child of war.
13346	APW_ENG_20070215.1376.LDC2009T13	Up to 200,000 people were killed in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, and 1.8 million others lost their homes.

13367	APW_ENG_20080519.0518.LDC2009T13	A breakthrough in the slow-moving dialogue appears unlikely -- not least because of a falling out within the coalition over how to restore judges fired last year by the former military strongman.

13417	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Boxing: Bradley headed for the big time after Witter defeat
13418	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Timothy Bradley has set his sights on becoming the king of the world's light- welterweights after capturing the WBC belt in shock split point decision win over Junior Witter.
13419	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	In his first professional fight outside of his native California, Bradley knocked Witter over in the sixth round and did enough to claim the World Boxing Council title by judges' decisions of 115-113 and 114-113 for, and 115-112 against.
13420	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	It was a controlled, clever and calculated display from Bradley, who not only conceded home advantage but ten years to the more experienced Witter.
13421	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Englishman Witter looked on the verge of suffering his first stoppage defeat when Bradley caught him with a looping right.
13422	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I always knew I would get to Junior in the second half of the fight," Bradley told AFP.
13423	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"He pulls back his chin in the air so I felt I could throw a counter right and it worked in the sixth.
13424	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"It’s a punch that I have worked on.
13425	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew the first four rounds would be hard but through the sixth and seventh rounds I came on.
13426	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I knew I had to win it in the second half of the fight."
13427	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter, 34, sank to the canvas in his own corner to take a mandatory eight count and sensibly avoided any danger by back- pedalling for the rest of the sixth round.
13429	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	At the end of the fight, Witter looked concerned as to the outcome and Bradley is now left in line for bigger pay days against the other world champions in the division -- Andreas Kotelnik (WBA), Paulie Malignaggi (IBF) and Ricardo Torres (WBO).
13431	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"I love Ricky Hatton and I would love to fight him.
13432	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	If the fight took place in the USA and the money was right, I would fight Junior again too," he said.
13433	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	Witter admitted he was not in the sort of form that had seen him knock out former WBA champion Vivian Harris in September, and blamed over-training for his poor performance.
13434	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"My timing and speed just wasn't there.
13435	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I always thought if I just turned up I would win, but I didn't turn up.
13436	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	"Getting put down in the sixth cost me the fight, but I still thought I did enough to win the fight.
13437	AFP_ENG_20080511.0364.LDC2009T13	I was sloppy though and just couldn’t get my timing right.

13546	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	A case of postelection nerves sent Wall Street plunging Wednesday as investors absorbed a stream of bad economic news abd wondered how a Barack Obama presidency will help the country weather a possibly severe recession.

13554	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"Wall Street can spin it anyway they want to, but this is likely going to be more prolonged than people anticipated.
13555	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	People are locking in profits and realizing we're not out of the woods."
13556	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Beyond broad economic concerns, worries about the financial sector intensified after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. began to notify about 3,200 employees globally that they have been lost their jobs as part of a broader plan to slash 10 percent of the investment bank's work force, a person familiar with the situation said.
13557	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The cuts were first reported last month.
13558	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Goldman fell 8 percent, while other financial names also fell
13559	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Citigroup Inc. dropped 14 percent.

13562	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Although the market expected Obama to win the election, as the session wore on investors were clearly worrying about the weakness of the economy and pondered what the Obama administration might do to help it.
13563	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Analysts said the market is already anxious about who Obama selects as the next Treasury Secretary, as well as who he picks for other Cabinet positions.
13564	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"The celebration is over.
13567	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	It's an extremely tough job."
13568	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Analysts said investors were also uneasy in advance of the Labor Department's October employment report, to be issued Friday.
13569	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Economists, on average, expect a 200,000 drop in payrolls, according to Thomson/IFR.
13570	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Late-day selling by hedge funds helped deepen the market's losses during the last hour.
13571	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	More selling by the funds is expected to weigh on the market ahead of a Nov. 15 cutoff for shareholders to notify fund managers of their intent to cash out investments before year-end.
13572	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The Dow fell 486.01, or 5.05 percent, to 9,139.27.

13578	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's trading, which followed a 300-point jump in the Dow on Tuesday, showed that the market is living up to expectations of continued volatility as it tries to recover from the devastating losses of the last two months.
13580	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Analysts agree that Obama's most immediate priority will be dealing with the nation's financial crisis and deciding how to further implement the $700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last month.
13581	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Goldman said trading could remain turbulent as investors begin assessing the shape and direction of Obama's forthcoming economic policies.
13582	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	"The market has to go through a period of figuring out if they are going to gain confidence in Obama and the Congress or lose it," he said, adding that investors will be paying close attention to who will be appointed to top economic posts.
13583	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Obama's victory means that industries such as oil and gas producers, utilities and pharmaceuticals may face greater regulation and even taxes, while labor unions and automakers are expected to benefit.
13584	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	In addition, banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and the rest of the financial sector will almost certainly face attempts at a regulatory overhaul by the Democratic Congress next year.

13589	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	In addition to monitoring the direction the next administration will take, investors continue to heed the state of the credit markets.
13590	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	The paralysis in the credit markets that began after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in mid-September has been alleviated somewhat by a series of government interventions, but they still show some signs of strain.
13591	APW_ENG_20081105.1636.LDC2009T13	Banks continued to ratchet down the rates they charge one another for borrowing on Wednesday, but the key interbank lending rate -- the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor -- remains well above the Federal Reserve's target interest rate of 1 percent.

13680	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Myanmar's military rulers Sunday threatened to take "effective action" against pro-democracy supporters who have staged a rare string of anti-junta protests across the country over the last three weeks.
13681	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The secretive regime took the unusual step of issuing a statement directly to the news media, accusing the National League for Democracy (NLD) of trying to instigate nationwide unrest.
13682	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"They agitated through various means to instigate riots and unrest among the people.
13683	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The NLD conspired to create this situation to derail the national political process," it said.
13685	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The monks also held about 20 government officials hostage for several hours on Thursday, in the most dramatic standoff with the regime since the protests broke out on August 19.
13686	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	"Under these circumstances, the government will never tolerate such malicious acts and will take effective action against those committing such acts in accordance with the existing law," the statement said.
13687	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Normally such statements would be filtered through official media, sometimes several days later, but the three-page document dated Saturday was given directly to journalists on Sunday and reported immediately in the state press.
13688	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	Amnesty International estimates that more than 150 people have been arrested over the protests, which were sparked by a massive hike in fuel prices last month.
13689	AFP_ENG_20070909.0345.LDC2009T13	The government again defended the price hike in the statement Sunday, saying it was necessary because of high world oil prices that had made fuel subsidies unaffordable.

13711	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	To remind motorists that they must stop whenever someone steps off the curb into a crosswalk.
13712	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In an unusual undercover operation, Delgado posed as a pedestrian on a busy street while fellow officers waited for drivers to barrel past her in violation of a law that requires them yield at crosswalks, even if there is no stop sign.
13713	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Chicago this year joined a growing number of big cities and small towns that are sending officers into traffic to make motorists pay more attention to pedestrians.
13714	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"People, they don't care," said Delgado, whose bright pink baseball hat and orange blouse made her especially tough to miss.
13715	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"It's 'Get out of my way.'
13716	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The whole mentality is 'Get out of my way.'"
13717	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	With Delgado's help, police stopped 78 vehicles in just two hours and told them they'd violated a law that's been on the books for years.
13718	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	That number easily could have been doubled, but officers stopped only drivers who kept moving after Delgado had walked four or five feet into the road.
13719	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	When they were pulled over, motorists offered all kinds of explanations: One saw the pedestrian in the crosswalk but hadn't heard about the law requiring him to stop.
13720	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Another knew about the law but didn't see the pedestrian.
13721	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Nearly 4,800 pedestrians were killed and 61,000 injured in 2006, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
13722	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago alone, 65 pedestrians have died annually in recent years.
13723	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The number of deaths has dropped, but there is concern those numbers could climb again as more vehicles hit the road, and the elderly population skyrockets.
13725	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"That, along with more cars ... is a recipe for danger."
13726	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Some communities already are seeing more walkers because of the slow economy.
13727	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"The way gas prices are, people are rediscovering their feet," said Pam Fischer, highway traffic safety director in New Jersey, which recently launched a "Cops in the Crosswalks" program.
13728	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In Chicago, officers gave motorists a brief lecture about the law, then sent relieved drivers on their way.
13729	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	But police understand that the only thing more effective than a lecture from a police officer is a lecture and a ticket.
13730	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"If there's really no threat of getting a ticket for it, you're not going to really pay attention," said officer Chuck Trendle, who was working with Delgado.
13732	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"But until you hit somebody in the wallet, it doesn't stick."
13733	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The threat of a ticket seemed to work in Bellingham, Washington.
13734	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	After the city started a police-decoy program in 2002, the percentage of drivers who yielded to pedestrians rose at least 25 percent -- even at corners where tickets were not being issued.
13735	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	In St. Petersburg, Florida, the results were even more impressive.
13736	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	The percentage of motorists who yielded to pedestrians jumped from 2 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2007, after police began writing tickets, educating the public and installing flashing beacons.
13737	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Pedestrian crashes dropped 17 percent between 2005 and 2006.
13739	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	Police say undercover pedestrians will focus attention on crosswalk safety the same way that giving tickets for seat belt violations convinced more people to buckle up in the 1980s.
13740	APW_ENG_20080716.1245.LDC2009T13	"Eventually, people get it," Trendle said.

13753	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	September was an especially grim month for suppliers, with companies announcing plans to shutter at least 12 plants and eliminate thousands more jobs.

13774	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	His reason for the green car is not so much to save the human race, he says, since he has little regard for the human race.
13775	NYT_ENG_20081005.0087.LDC2009T13	But rather, Kevorkian, says he doesn't really need a gas guzzler since he doesn't stray far from his rundown apartment complex anyhow.

13807	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	More than 100 children between the ages of one and two were given the vaccines during the trails, which have since been halted, the statement said.
13808	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said the deputy director of the hospital had been paid US$50,000 (euro38,000) to participate in the trials and that such tests on minors were illegal in Russia.
13809	APW_ENG_20070302.1288.LDC2009T13	They also said parents had been told the vaccines were humanitarian aid.

13817	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The religious police enforce the kingdom's strict Islamic lifestyle, patrolling public places to ensure women are covered, the sexes don't mingle, shops close five times a day for Muslim prayers and men go to the mosque and worship.
13818	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The man's family is demanding the death penalty for those found guilty of the death their relative, Ahmed al-Bulaiwi, a retired border patrol guard in his early 50s.
13819	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Al-Bulaiwi died in custody shortly after his June 1 arrest for being alone with a woman who was not a relative -- an act considered an offense in the kingdom.
13820	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Audah al-Bulaiwi, who is representing the family in court, said three judges presided over the first hearing in the case in the northern city of Tabuk.
13821	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	He said the defendants -- three members of the religious police and a fourth believed to be from the regular police -- were present in the courtroom.
13822	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	"We are demanding execution for those found guilty," he said.
13823	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam under which those convicted of murder, drug trafficking, rape and armed robbery are executed in public with a sword.
13824	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	A new hearing has been set for Tuesday, said Audah al-Bulaiwi.
13825	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The trial was supposed to begin on June 23, but a judge postponed it to Sunday because the documents the al-Bulaiwi family had presented were incomplete.
13826	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	Al-Bulaiwi's death -- and the case of a second man who died in custody -- are a setback for the Commission for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which employs the religious police.
13827	APW_ENG_20070701.0347.LDC2009T13	The cases have provoked a wave of condemnation and calls for the regulation of this independent body.

13863	APW_ENG_20081031.1009.LDC2009T13	The company attributed the downgrade in part to last week's government proposal to nationalize private pension funds, which has greatly spooked investors, sending overall confidence in the local markets into a tailspin.

13902	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"We will not recognize even one inch for Jews in the land of Palestine as other Muslim leaders have," bin Laden said.
13903	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	In Iraq, a number of Sunni Arab tribes in western Anbar province have formed a coalition fighting al-Qaida-linked insurgents that U.S. officials credit for deeply reducing violence in the province.
13904	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military has been working to form similar "Awakening Councils" in other areas of Iraq.
13905	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunni Arabs who have joined the Awakening Councils "have betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people.
13906	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	They will suffer in life and in the afterlife."

13912	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Petraeus said al-Qaida attaches "enormous importance" to "these tribes that have turned against them, and to the general sense that Sunni Arab communities have rejected them more and more around Iraq."
13913	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"They are trying to counter this and they have done so by attacking them," which is increasingly turning Sunnis against al- Qaida, he said.
13915	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"The most evil of the traitors are those who trade away their religion for the sake of their mortal life," bin Laden said.
13919	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Besides the Awakening Councils, some Sunni insurgent groups that continue to fight the Americans have rejected the Islamic State.
13920	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden said Sunnis should pledge their allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the little known "emir" or leader of the Islamic State of Iraq.
13922	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Failure to give allegiance to the emir after he has been endorsed leads to great evils," bin Laden warned.
13923	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	"Emir Abu Omar would rather have his neck severed than betray the Muslims ... Emir Abu Omar and his brothers are not one of those who accept compromise or meeting the enemy halfway."

13925	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	But the voice resembled that of bin Laden.
13926	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was posted on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al-Sahab, issues the group's messages.
13927	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The tape was the fifth message released by bin Laden this year, a flurry of activity after he went more than a year without issuing any tapes.
13928	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The messages began with a Sept. 8 video that showed bin Laden for the first time in nearly three years.
13929	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	The other messages this year have been audiotapes.

13932	APW_ENG_20071230.0022.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahri took a sharper tone in a Dec. 16 video, branding as "traitors" those who work with the anti- Qaida tribal councils and calling for Sunnis to purge anyone cooperating with the Americans.

13935	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	A change of scenery might be good for Clayton, who is in the final year of his contract.
13936	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	And certainly, the Bucs have a surplus of pass catchers.
13937	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	But it's unlikely any route Clayton runs this season will take him out of Tampa Bay.

13949	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	That's not to say the Bucs won't entertain trades, but at receiver they are dealing from strength.

13962	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	"I kind of did the math on that.
13963	NYT_ENG_20080825.0224.LDC2009T13	So, if you play him 12 plays in the game, is that really going to get him ready to play in the regular season?

14064	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Walter Smith has urged his Rangers players to forget the disappointment of their UEFA Cup final defeat here on Wednesday and concentrate on completing the domestic treble that remains in their grasp.
14067	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"Obviously it will be difficult to judge how much the disappointment takes out of the players.
14068	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But what is at stake for them is that we have an opportunity with four games to go to win two trophies so I would hope that we can overcome the disappointment we have suffered.
14069	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"If we win our next three games in the SPL and become champions we will be happy."
14070	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Rangers' cause was not helped by the refusal of SPL bosses to extend the season, which would have enabled Smith's men to avoid playing last weekend, as Zenit were able to do.
14071	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	But Smith refused to blame the intense end-of-season schedule for his side's wilting at the end of what was their 64th match of a campaign that started in late July last year.
14072	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think that had any influence on the result," Smith said.
14073	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"The players tonight were ready to play and we were just coming into the match when they scored and that first goal changed the whole complexion of the game."
14075	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Konstantin Zyrianov added a close-range second in stoppage time to make sure Zenit emulated the achievement of 2005 winners CSKA Moscow and condemned the tens of thousands of Rangers supporters who had descended on Manchester to a miserable journey back to Scotland.
14076	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Arshavin, who is being tipped as a potential star of Euro 2008, was also involved in the build-up to the second goal and Smith acknowledged that a player of his guile was something Rangers lacked.
14077	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I think we have missed a little bit of that all through the year -- somebody who can do something a little bit different.
14078	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have a good work ethic in this team and it has taken them a long way but in a few games we have lacked someone to give us a little bit more creativity.
14079	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I don't think anyone, myself or the players, thought this season would lead to a European final.
14080	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"So you have to give them credit for what they have achieved against a lot of good European sides."
14081	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith believes Zenit are good enough to go on to make an impact in the Champions League next season, although Advocaat admitted he could face a battle to keep his squad together.
14082	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"I have no doubt that some players will go and then you have to start again.
14083	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	It is always the problem with success.
14084	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We already sold Martin Skrtl to Liverpool but you have to keep players like that if you want to become even better.
14085	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	"It is not only Arshavin we have to keep.
14086	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	There are other players who are very important to us.
14087	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	We have to try to keep this team together and add three or four players so that we can rotate.
14088	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	At the moment it is always the same 12 to 14 players who play but to go to the next level you need more than that."
14089	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Zenit were denied a blatant penalty on the stroke of half-time, when Kirk Broadfoot handled in the area, but overall Rangers did a good job of containing Zenit until 18 minutes from the end.
14090	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	Smith's men, who were showing signs of fatigue, were partly to blame for their own downfall having lost possession from their own throw on the left.
14091	AFP_ENG_20080515.0849.LDC2009T13	The ball was quickly worked forward by the Russians and Denisov played a deft one-two with Arshavin before sliding the ball past Neal Alexander and Zyrianov wrapped things up in stoppage time.

14106	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-10-04 02:48:25 UTC
14107	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	A judge ordered a Texas doctor and his wife on Friday not to distribute videotaped footage of Anna Nicole Smith's breast augmentation surgery in 1994.
14108	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The order settles alawsuit filed last year by Howard K. Stern, the executor of Smith's estate, who was trying to stop Dr. Gerald Johnson and his wife from distributing the tapes of the former Playboy Playmate and reality star who died last year.
14111	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Johnson has said he routinely records surgeries with the patient's permission and promises to keep the video confidential "during the patient's lifetime."
14112	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	He said he gave Riccio permission to use the video after Smith died of a drug overdose in February 2007 in Florida.
14113	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She was 39.
14114	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Riccio's daughter edited the footage into a five-minute tape, scored with music similar to the theme from the film "Jaws."
14115	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	The Johnsons' Houston-based attorney, Gus Pappas, did not return a message seeking comment Friday.
14116	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Larry Birkhead, who fathered Smith's daughter, called the video "truly disgusting" in a sworn declaration issued last year.
14117	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	"It was clear that Anna Nicole was unconscious during the videotaping, and even more disturbing, the videotape focused on areas of her nude body that were unrelated to the location of the surgery," he said in the declaration.
14118	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	Stern's attorney, Vivian Thoreen, said all the tapes have been accounted for under the judge's previous orders.
14119	APW_ENG_20081004.0102.LDC2009T13	She said the other terms of the settlement are confidential.

14134	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Beyond the barbed wire and camouflaged hangars that once housed Soviet-made fighter jets, some see hope for a small airport and a brighter tomorrow.
14136	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The shuttered air base in northern Poland, which dates back to World War II, is a likely site for 10 interceptors for the U.S. missile defense program, a plan Washington says is necessary to counter potential attacks from so-called rogue states.
14138	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
14139	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Let's tell the truth here, it's not aimed against Iran, or against Vietnam or whatever -- it's against Russia."
14140	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The U.S. has been wrestling with such perceptions of its plan to place 10 interceptors in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic since opening negotiations with the two countries early last year.
14141	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Washington says the system is needed to protect the U.S. and Europe from emerging threats from so-called rogue states such as Iran.
14142	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its security.
14145	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I don't like it
14146	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	if the base gets built, the Russians will fire at us for sure, so we will in fact be the most threatened," says Zenon Kuwalko, a 54-year-old engineer from Slupsk.
14147	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.
14148	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"We have not received any benefits from our cooperation with the Americans so far -- not one thing," says Leszek Pieniak, 48, who owns the Pod Kogutem restaurant near the base.
14149	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not in Poland -- nothing.
14150	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	We don't even have visas.
14151	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	I'll tell my grandchildren that maybe in 20 years they'll have a shot at visa-free travel to the U.S."
14152	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"I'm against the base and that's it."
14153	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.
14155	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense block off and isolate our region."
14159	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says Chmiel.

14162	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera is giving up "The Ghosts."
14163	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting costs in the wake of the economic downturn, the Met is dropping next season's highly anticipated revival of John Corigliano's "The Ghosts of Versailles" that was to feature the company debut of Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth.
14165	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"In looking at ways to economize, that was an unfortunate sacrifice," Gelb said in a telephone interview.
14166	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's a much more expensive revival than most."
14167	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said all eight new productions will proceed as planned, but that some revivals may be replaced with less expensive ones.
14168	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in March 2010.
14169	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting it will save more than $1 million.
14170	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"If you look around at all the opera houses and what's happening, it's obvious that this is a time of crisis.
14171	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Peter is just doing what he can to save the company," Corigliano said.
14172	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Times have changed from the past in terms of grand opera.
14173	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In this country, at least, it's certainly boning down."
14174	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb had been a big proponent of increasing the Met's presentations of works by living composers.
14175	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We will plan to put it in on at another time," he said.
14176	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Chenoweth was understanding.
14178	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"She has a great deal of respect for Peter Gelb and understands the steps that need to be taken during this economic crisis."
14180	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"As we are examining the cost of running the Met season with an ever-increasingly careful eye toward saving costs, we're looking at the running costs of certain revivals compared to others," Gelb said.
14181	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It will involve the shifting of some repertoire."
14182	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	He was not prepared to announce other shifts in revivals because discussions with the singers are ongoing.
14183	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The decision by the Met, the largest musical institution in the United States, is the most high-profile evidence of the profound changes the economy is causing in the arts world.
14184	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The Washington National Opera announced this week that it is postponing next season's presentation of Wagner's four-opera "Der Ring des Nibelungen," which had been planned since 2001.
14185	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	The company said that while it anticipated sellouts, "even the strongest ticket sales cover only a fraction of production expenses and the opera must look to the generosity of individuals, foundations and corporations to support its work."
14188	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	There is a chance Opera Pacific will close for good.
14189	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gerard Mortier, who was to take over as general manager and artistic director of the New York City Opera next season, quit last Friday because the company failed to raise enough money to pay for his plans.
14190	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Change has been less drastic at the Met.
14191	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Next season is the first completely planned by Gelb, and the eight new productions are the Met's most since 1966-67, its initial season at Lincoln Center.
14192	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb responded to inquiries about the change in plans a day after the Web site Opera Chic said the Met intended to cut four unspecified productions from next season's schedule.
14193	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb said that when this season opened late September, the box office had been 2 percent ahead of the 2007-08 season, when prices were essentially the same.
14194	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Now, the season-to-season comparison is even.
14195	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We're experiencing fluctuations at the box office," he said.
14196	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Things are less predictable than they were last season."
14197	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In other Met news, Gelb said the company will soon release its first self-produced DVD, the English-language version of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute."

14223	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Millwood, who is 2-4 with a 6.62 ERA in 35 1/3 innings, injured his left hamstring May 14 in a start against the Angels.

14225	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He's eligible to come of the disabled list Wednesday.

14228	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	He had three strikeouts and his fastball routinely hit 90-92 mph.
14229	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I felt a little out of sorts, but I think the biggest thing was just getting some pitches in," Millwood said. "
14230	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	(My pitches) were fine.
14231	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Nothing was horrible, so that was good.
14232	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	I threw my fastball wherever I wanted to, for the most part, and that's key for me."
14233	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Rangers bullpen coach Dom Chiti, who was with Millwood in Frisco, said the pitcher proved he's healthy.
14234	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"I think he's ready to go," Chiti said.
14235	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Kevin showed everyone that he's healthy and his leg was fine.

14238	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Rangers outfielder Jerry Hairston was 1-for-4 Sunday with a line- drive homer to left field for Frisco.
14239	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston says the pain from a bulging disk, which was pinching a nerve in his neck and put him on the disabled list, has subsided.
14240	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	" (Sunday) was probably the best I've felt in a long time," he said.
14241	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	"Especially the last three at bats -- even the strikeout -- I felt great.
14242	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	It's just good to be back playing again."
14243	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	Hairston hopes to be back with the Rangers in Seattle after receiving a cortisone shot Tuesday and playing a game or two in Oklahoma City.

14889	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)
14893	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant operational implications for UNMIK," he said.
14894	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Pending Security Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground in a manner consistent with the operational framework established under resolution 1244," he said.
14895	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."
14897	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region.
14898	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	He concluded by saying that the UN's efforts in Kosovo are aimed at ensuring that the political and security situation in Kosovo and the wider region remains stable, and that the safety and security of the population are preserved.

14900	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iran will use force to defend nuclear drive: Ahmadinejad
14902	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"For them, subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts.
14903	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against Iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in," Ahmadinejad said.
14905	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The comments came as the United States on Friday set a weekend deadline for Iran to respond to an international offer to freeze its nuclear drive.
14907	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	But an EU diplomat said in Brussels that the European Union is in no rush for a response from Iran.
14908	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of anonymity after Washington set the deadline.
14909	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We're in no rush" to have a response "in the next 24 hours."
14913	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Losing My Jihadism
14915	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
14916	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It needs someone with the courage of Martin Luther.
14917	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
14918	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
14920	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
14921	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for many verses -- especially those having to do with relations between Islam and other religions -- to be reinterpreted in favor of a more modern Islam.
14922	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
14924	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
14925	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
14926	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
14927	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
14928	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
14929	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I prayed to God to give me the strength to overcome them.
14931	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
14932	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
14933	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Viewing modern education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as they had been taught 1,200 years ago.
14934	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
14935	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1991, I took part in firebombing video stores in Riyadh and a women's center in my home town of Buraidah, seeing them as symbols of sin in a society that was marching rapidly toward modernization.
14936	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
14937	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
14938	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he create it himself?
14939	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
14940	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	By the time I turned 26, much of the turmoil in me had abated, and I made my peace with God.
14941	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
14942	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I saw Islamic judges ignoring the marks of torture borne by my prison comrades.
14943	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I learned of Islamic teachers who molested their students.
14944	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
14945	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me.
14949	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically if our religion is to survive and thrive.
14950	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
14951	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some men in my mosque refused to greet me.
14952	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
14953	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
14954	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
14955	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
14957	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
14958	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
14959	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
14960	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
14961	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I tried to give a new interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims and Christians and Jews.
14962	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
14963	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
14964	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
14965	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
14966	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban my writing.
14967	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I became a favorite target on the Internet, where my writings were lambasted and labeled blasphemous.
14968	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
14969	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
14970	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt that He was moving me toward another kind of belief, where all that matters is that we pray to God from the heart.
14971	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
14972	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is great.''
14973	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
14974	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
14975	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
14976	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
14977	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
14978	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
14979	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring my infidelity.
14980	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But one evening not long after that, I heard a radio broadcast of the verse of light.
14981	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Even though I had memorized the Koran at 15, I felt as though I was hearing this verse for the first time.
14982	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
14983	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
14984	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
14985	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
14986	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
14987	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	And I believe that others can find it, too.
14989	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
14990	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his everlasting paradise.
14991	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
14992	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	he shared it only with a small, trusted circle of students.
14993	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous uprising.
14994	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.

15005	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Oil prices retreated slightly in Asian trading Thursday after a U.S. government report boosted prices by failing to alleviate concerns that refiners are still not producing enough gasoline to meet demand.

15007	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The contract jumped 91 cents Wednesday to settle at US$66.26 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly snapshot showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles were unchanged last week and refinery utilization fell.

15010	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The price has stayed above US$66 a barrel, "a strong level -- and the strong pricing is supported by the tight U.S. gasoline supply situation," Shum said.
15011	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gasoline inventories were unchanged at 201.5 million barrels for the week ended June 8, the EIA report said.
15012	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Analysts had expected gas inventories to rise by 2 million barrels.
15013	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gas stockpiles are 6 percent lower than inventories in the same week a year ago.

15015	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Most analysts say refineries should be using 94 percent to 95 percent of their capacity at this time of year.
15016	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Crude oil inventories rose by 100,000 barrels last week, when analysts had expected a 400,000-barrel decline.
15017	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, rose 300,000 barrels a day, falling short of expectations for a 1.5 million barrel-per-day increase.
15018	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	U.S. refiners reported an unusually high number of outages this spring, crimping gasoline supplies.
15019	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Reports of outages continued on Wednesday, with Valero Energy Corp. saying it was shutting down a machine at its Ardmore, Okla., refinery for maintenance.

15022	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Geopolitical factors also continue to provide a floor for oil prices, he said.
15024	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Calls for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output have also largely been ignored, with the cartel stressing that supplies are sufficient.

15032	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	The east was even worse-hit with only 10 percent of all regional trains running.
15033	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the union said the motivation among the striking train drivers was still very strong and that GDL would announce at a news conference later Friday further plans regarding strikes next week.
15034	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	"The willingness to strike is high and unbroken," Maik Brandenburger said.
15035	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	GDL hopes to pressure Deutsche Bahn into giving in to its demands of a cut in the working week by one hour to 40 hours and a pay increase of up to 31 percent for its members.
15036	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	It has rejected a 4.5 percent raise that Deutsche Bahn agreed to in talks with two other unions that represent railway workers.
15037	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Bahn carries some 5 million passengers daily.

15039	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	PARIS 2007-01-30 18:29:42 UTC
15040	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Eiffel Tower's 20,000 flashing light bulbs will go dark for five minutes on Thursday evening, hours before scientists and officials publish a long-awaited report about global warming.
15041	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
15042	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a report laying out policy proposals for governments based on the latest research on global warming.
15045	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"There's a lot of momentum that has being building," Nuttall said.
15046	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"We have a window of opportunity."
15047	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Nuttall said the summit could be held between July and December.
15048	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the conference's host.
15049	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries that marked previous reports.
15050	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report must be unanimously approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can challenge the scientists' wording.
15052	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
15054	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Another observer who has taken part in several such conferences, Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace, said, "So far we're running on timetable.
15055	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	But who knows, we've got two more days.
15056	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	If there's any panic, it will be Wednesday night when they realize they've only got a few hours left."
15057	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and sea levels this century.
15058	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report "won't change our scientific basis, but it will make our jobs easier," Steve Sawyer, of Greenpeace, said Tuesday.
15059	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	"It is an important and powerful new tool in public debate and policy debate."
15060	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups have long urged governments and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power instead of greenhouse gas-emitting ones like coal and oil.
15061	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	Greenhouse gases are considered a key culprit of rising global temperatures.

15105	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	SAN FRANCISCO 2007-11-13 22:19:16 UTC
15106	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday suspended all fishing in areas affected by last week's San Francisco Bay oil spill, calling what was the area's worst spill in nearly two decades an "unbelievable human failure" and promising an investigation.
15107	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
15108	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State Association of Counties annual meeting.
15109	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Then on top of it, it takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
15110	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
15111	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
15112	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A Coast Guard places a skimming vessel at the scene within 80 minutes.
15113	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
15114	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
15115	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Believe me, we will ask the tough questions that need to be asked."
15116	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Coast Guard officials defended their response as "by the book," but concede mistakes in their communication with the public.
15117	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
15118	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000 gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
15121	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
15122	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
15123	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas will be closed to fishing.
15124	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood caught in areas impacted by the spill.
15125	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
15126	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
15128	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
15129	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.
15130	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on problems involving management and communication between the officers on the ship's bridge at the time.
15131	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
15132	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Darrell Wilson, a representative for Regal Stone, said the company was eager to hear the results of the investigation.
15133	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.
15134	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We take our job of environmental stewardship very seriously."

15154	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining dissidents?"
15157	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Hundreds, perhaps thousands of unarmed protesters were killed by military units when the government sent in the troops to end six weeks of pro-democracy protests.

15170	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Myanmar announced the complete end of its national convention here Monday, laying down all detailed basic principles for drafting a new state constitution.
15171	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here said this is the formal end of the first step of a seven-step roadmap to democracy.
15172	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a general election to produce parliament representatives and formation of a new democratic government in line with the government's seven-step roadmap.
15173	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
15175	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic system economically.
15176	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
15177	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
15178	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Besides, armed forces members are also to be nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and border affairs.
15179	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The defense services commander-in-chief will represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the right to take over and exercise state power in case of state emergency that could cause disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national sovereignty.
15180	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
15181	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	It will not allow foreign troops to be deployed in the country.
15182	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
15183	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
15184	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
15185	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	As a result, the national convention turned into a status of long adjournment from March 1996 to April 2004.
15186	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Aimed at realization of national reconciliation and pushing forward the process of democratization, the military government announced the seven-step roadmap in August 2003, which mainly include the reconvening of national convention, drafting of new state constitution, holding of national referendum on drafted constitution, sponsoring general election and formation of new civilian government.
15187	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
15189	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of the constitutional national convention but did not mention the duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the time table about when the national referendum on the drafted constitution will be held.

15317	AFP_ENG_20080417.0433.LDC2009T13	A local neighbour raised the alarm after she found the bright yellow case marked "radioactive" on Thursday morning outside the secondary school.
15318	AFP_ENG_20080417.0433.LDC2009T13	Police cordoned off the area and recovered the suitcase intact, a Madrid police spokeswoman told AFP.
15320	AFP_ENG_20080417.0433.LDC2009T13	It warned the public of the dangers of opening the suitcase, saying it contained "two sources of low-level radioactivity".
15321	AFP_ENG_20080417.0433.LDC2009T13	The material could "pose risks if it is opened or if the equipment is destroyed," the CSN warned.
15322	AFP_ENG_20080417.0433.LDC2009T13	The case was part of a kit for geologists to measure the density and humidity of the earth.

15332	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Well, The Washington Post's Web site screwed up the John Edwards story, too.
15333	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	For 51 seconds.
15334	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	And it was an accident, of the cringe-inducing variety.
15335	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The Democratic presidential candidate had already announced@ that he was continuing his campaign, despite the recurrence of his wife's cancer, when washingtonpost.com put up a headline at 12:32:20 p.m. Thursday: ``John Edwards Suspends White House Bid.''
15336	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	By 12:33:11 it was down -- replaced by ``Edwards: Wife's Cancer is Back'' -- but not because anyone had caught the mistake.
15338	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It's embarrassing it got out there.''
15340	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	The news was already out at the time of The Post's online screwup.
15341	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said the Web site had prepared three different versions of the headline and story summary -- on Edwards suspending his campaign, dropping out or staying in -- so that it could move quickly once the candidate announced his plans.
15342	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady still isn't sure how the mistake happened.
15343	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was not an error of journalism,'' he said.
15344	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``It was an error of production ... Nobody knows how it got up because nobody hit the publishing button,'' Brady said.
15346	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``This was a big story,'' Downie said.
15347	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The fact that we had a wrong report up for 51 seconds -- even though it was unintentional -- should have been known to us in the newsroom.''
15348	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said he learned of the foulup early Thursday afternoon after a tip had been carried on the Media Bistro blog Fishbowl DC.
15349	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``The mistake I made was in not alerting people that it had happened because it was a high-profile story,'' Brady said.
15350	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``We should have been up front.''
15351	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Fishbowl DC posted a screen shot of the erroneous washingtonpost.com headline Friday morning.
15352	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	Brady said his staff is investigating possible defects in their publishing tools to prevent a recurrence.
15353	LTW_ENG_20070324.0050.LDC2009T13	``At least we know we have a problem with the tool now,'' he said, ``but that's not the way I'd prefer to find out about it.''
15358	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Coates, an International Olympic Committee member, said he hoped a legacy of the Beijing Olympics would be that China takes more care in future.
15359	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	When asked if organisers had done enough to clean up the pollution, he said: "No.
15360	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	But I don't know what more thay can do.
15361	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"It may well be permanent damage.
15362	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Significant pollution is a problem, but we're getting on with it.
15363	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"Let's hope one legacy of the Games will be the realisation of the damage that has been done to the environment and will continue to be done unless they are more careful."
15365	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Air quality has been one of the top concerns for the 10,500 athletes coming to Beijing for the Olympics, with Rogge fanning those worries last year when he said endurance events could be postponed if the pollution was heavy.
15367	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	What they have done is extraordinary," Rogge told reporters.
15368	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	On the same day, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in China told AFP that the pollution could hinder athletes during the Olympics, and that the long-term dangers to the population of the city were serious.
15369	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"There is an air pollution problem in Beijing," Hans Troedsson said.
15370	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"However, we are missing the point by having so much attention on the short-term exposure while the long-term exposure is really ignored -- that is where we have a problem," the Swede said.
15372	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	"Most measures we have taken are long-term measures.
15373	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	These long- term measures won't be terminated just because the Olympic Games have come to an end," he said Friday.
15374	AFP_ENG_20080808.0619.LDC2009T13	Beijing has shut down many polluting industries and taken millions of cars off the road in an effort to improve air quality for the Games.
15376	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	ANOTHER DISTURBING ROADBLOCKTHIS ROADBLOCK IS DISTURBING
15377	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	CLEVELAND - They were kings of the road.
15378	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are road kill.
15379	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And it's giving their fans road rage.
15381	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Hub hoop junkies witnessed the ease of a Game 2 victory at TD Banknorth Garden and concluded that the real Celtics were ready to take it to the streets of Cleveland.
15382	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No more of the nonsense that plagued them for three long nights in Atlanta.
15383	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And then the game started and Boston's swagger and superiority evaporated.
15384	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Again.
15385	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics didn't show up.
15386	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got run out of the gym, 108-84, last night by the same team that couldn't score 75 points in the New Garden.
15387	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
15388	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It wasn't about LeBron James this time.
15389	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The King carried his shooting woes back home (5 for 16 from the floor).
15390	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it didn't matter because the Cavaliers ran away from the Celtics long before halftime.
15391	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one and 43-17 early in the second.
15392	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The Celtics never got closer than 12 after intermission.
15393	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Boston's no-show included taking only two free throws in the first half, which ended with the Cavaliers leading, 52-35.
15394	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Paul Pierce took eight shots all night.
15395	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Ray Allen shot 4 for 12.
15396	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Point guard Rajon Rondo had zero assists in 23 minutes.
15397	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland has the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier attitude.
15398	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, it's disappointing for us," said coach Doc Rivers.
15399	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"I thought Cleveland came out and played harder at the start of the game.
15400	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	In every way they beat us tonight.
15401	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They outcoached us, they played harder, they got the loose balls.
15402	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We were not comfortable.
15403	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We didn't make plays.
15404	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Instead of being the solid defensive team that we've been, I thought we got down because our offense wasn't going."
15405	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This makes the Green 6-0 at home and 0-4 on the road in this postseason.
15406	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Though it is technically possible for the Celtics to win the championship if this continues, the hot-cold, home-away dynamic does little to inspire confidence.
15407	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This caliber of play is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or Hornets.
15408	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So the same questions will be asked before the Celtics play Game 4 here tomorrow night.
15409	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The questions will be asked again and again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.
15410	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Strange.
15411	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	These same Celtics were a league-best 31-10 on the road this season.
15412	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They swept through Texas, which is virtually impossible in today's NBA.
15413	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	And now they are neutralized and intimidated by the likes of Philips Arena and Quicken Loans Arena.
15414	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	What gives?
15415	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"This is the NBA," said Rivers.
15416	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"Nothing surprises me in this league.
15417	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Did I think this would happen?
15418	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	No.
15419	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But it did happen.
15420	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	So now we just have to get ready for Monday night."
15421	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Asked to account for the home-road disparity, Rivers said, "I can't.
15422	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But we have to find out why."
15423	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We definitely took our lumps tonight," admitted Pierce.
15424	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We're going to come out better in Game 4.
15425	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to come out to a better start."
15426	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When Pierce was asked if he was worried, he said, "A little bit.
15427	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I'm disappointed.
15428	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be a lot more aggressive.
15429	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We've got to be aggressive on the road."
15430	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This was never a game.
15431	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland's Ben Wallace recovered from his Game 2 vapors and made his first three shots as the Cavaliers bolted to a 22-8 lead.
15432	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	That's a 14-point lead.
15433	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	I know this only because the overhead scoreboard at The Q offers a moronic feature entitled "The Diff."
15434	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	When it was 22-8, The Diff was 14.
15435	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Thanks.
15436	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	(Wonder if there are any hockey or soccer scoreboards that offer The Diff?)
15437	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics were hoping to avoid.
15438	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We've got to come out in the first quarter and put up a better fight," said Celtics guard Sam Cassell.
15439	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"We refused to play together offensively," said Rivers.
15440	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	"And that's the thing that alarms me from Atlanta.
15441	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They got a lot of the offensive rebounds.
15442	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But that's hustle.
15443	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	We have to do better."
15444	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	There is cause for concern.
15445	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This is a little more than a home- road thing.
15446	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It feels like the Celtics are being exposed.
15447	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Pierce and Allen have not been the same players they were during the regular season.
15448	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Rondo looks lost.
15449	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The team that won 66 games hasn't demonstrated the fortitude of a champion.
15450	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They lost only 16 games during the regular season, never by as many as 20.
15451	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Now they are 0-4 on the road in the playoffs and smarting from a 24-point beating.
15452	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for somebody to step forward.
15453	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Time for the Celtics to show up in a game played outside the Garden.

15456	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang Wenkang -- open on AIDS, less so on SARS -- set to lose job
15458	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang was removed Sunday as chief of the Communist Party branch for the Ministry of Health, state media said, in an indication that his days as minister may be numbered.
15459	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	According to analysts, stripping an official of his party position is usually the prelude to sacking him from his government job.
15460	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been put "under control".
15461	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Since then, several reports have emerged of a systematic cover-up of the extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, involving especially military hospitals in the capital.
15462	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's extensive background within military medicine.
15463	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
15464	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Until 1990 he served in various positions at the PLA's Second Medical University, before becoming deputy director of health at the PLA General Logistics Department until 1993.
15465	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After a series of positions outside the PLA, Zhang was appointed health minister in 1998, as a member of what was considered a more capable and active Cabinet under then-premier Zhu Rongji.
15466	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the spread of AIDS in China.
15467	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.
15468	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	BARGAIN-HUNTING, AND FEELING SHEEPISH ABOUT IT
15469	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding -- even more than usual for an industry that's been anticipating its demise since the advent of television.
15470	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The holiday season that just ended is likely to have been one of the worst in decades.
15471	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Publishers have been cutting back and laying off.
15472	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it wouldn't be acquiring any new manuscripts, a move akin to a butcher shop proclaiming it had stopped ordering fresh meat.
15473	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Bookstores, both new and secondhand, are faltering as well.
15474	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Olsson's, the leading independent chain in Washington, went bankrupt and shut down in September.
15475	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Robin's, which says it is the oldest bookstore in Philadelphia, will close next month.
15476	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The once-mighty Borders chain is on the rocks.
15477	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Powell's, the huge store in Portland, Ore., said sales were so weak it was encouraging its staff to take unpaid sabbaticals.
15478	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Don't blame this carnage on the recession or any of the usual suspects, including increased competition for the reader's time or diminished attention spans.
15479	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	What's undermining the book industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing habits of devoted readers.
15480	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In other words, it's all the fault of people like myself, who increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after their value to us is gone, sell them.
15481	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	This is not about Amazon peddling new books at discounted prices, which has been a factor in the book business for a decade, but about the rise of a worldwide network of amateurs who sell books from their homes or, if they're lazy like me, in partnership with an Internet dealer who does all the work for a chunk of the proceeds.
15482	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	They get their books from friends, yard sales, recycling centers, their own shelves, castoffs (I just bought a book from a guy whose online handle was Clif Is Emptying His Closet).
15483	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Some list them for as little as a penny, although most aim for at least a buck.
15484	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	This growing market is achieving an aggregate mass that is starting to prove problematic for publishers, new bookstores and secondhand bookstores.
15485	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	For readers and collectors, these resellers, as they are called, offer a great service.
15486	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lost in the hand-wringing over the state of the book industry is the fact that this is a golden age for those in love with old-fashioned printed volumes: More books are available for less effort and less money than ever before.
15487	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A book search engine like ViaLibri.net can knit together 20,000 booksellers around the world offering tens of millions of nearly new, used or rare books.
15488	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this?
15489	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Now it's become both an economic and a moral issue.
15490	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	How much do I want to pay, and where do I want that money to go?
15491	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To my local community via a bookstore?
15492	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To the publisher?
15493	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	To the author?
15494	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In theory, I want to support all of these fine folks.
15495	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In practice, I decide to save a buck.
15496	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Here's one example of how I casually wreak destruction.
15497	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	I was reading "Sylvia," an account by the late short-story master Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife.
15498	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon.
15499	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	I could buy a new paperback edition of that book, "Room for Doubt," for $13.95 plus tax in a bookstore.
15500	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	But there were dozens of copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent, plus shipping.
15501	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping.
15502	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three -- nor the author got a share.
15503	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	The book looked good as new.

15514	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Sales of classics and other backlist titles used to be the financial engine of publishers and bookstores as well, allowing them to take chances on new authors.

15519	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Michael Barnard, who owns Rakestraw Books in Danville, Calif., not far from Berkeley, was more critical of me.
15520	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	He said that I was taking Lesser's work while depriving her of an income, and that I would regret my selfish actions when all the physical stores were gone.
15522	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If you want it during those first few weeks when it is new, you will pay a premium.

15524	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"These cracks and fractures will only grow bigger," he said.
15525	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Lesser herself was philosophical.
15526	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"I am a pragmatist, not a thin- skinned, delicate little writer who thinks everything needs to be what it is in heaven," she said.
15527	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Still, she sounded a little taken aback at the going rate for her books.
15528	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"Twenty-five cents?
15529	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	That's all it was?"
15530	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	At least this way, the writer said, she gained a reader if not an income.
15531	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	If I had had to search for the book in a store, maybe I would never have found it.
15532	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"With the Internet, nothing is ever lost," Lesser said.
15533	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"That's the good news, and that's the bad news."
15534	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	And what of the woman who sold me the book?
15535	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She told me via e-mail that her real name was Heather Mash and that she worked as a domestic violence case manager in a women's shelter not too far from Berkeley.
15536	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	She didn't set out to subvert the publishing and bookselling world, she said.
15537	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Like most of us who sell online, Mash began because she had too many books and wanted to raise money to buy more.
15538	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	"I would rather sell a book for a penny and let someone enjoy it than keep it collecting dust," she said.
15539	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	No industry undermined by its greatest partisans will thrive long.

15542	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	As the Heather Mashes proliferate, traditional bookstores will continue to fade.
15543	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Secondhand outlets that don't sell online are already an anachronism.
15544	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Even the novelist Larry McMurtry, whose enormous secondhand shop in Archer City, Texas, was probably the biggest holdout against the Internet, has surrendered.

15548	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	O.T. ISN ' T AS SIMPLE AS TELLING TIME
15549	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A woman in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when she submitted her time sheet.
15550	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	She had worked 800 hours of overtime in 17 weeks, meaning she had been on the job about 12 or 13 hours a day, seven days a week, January through April.
15551	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living.
15552	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The work/life experts were predictably appalled that Bird had logged so many hours.
15553	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And the labor lawyers?
15554	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	They were impressed -- that she had actually collected her overtime pay.
15555	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Time was when overtime was extra money for extra work, which in its simplest form it still is, but there is nothing simple about it anymore.
15556	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
15557	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Most states have dense rules about overtime, of course, and the federal government has the Fair Labor Standards Act, which says that unless you are an "exempt worker" you must be paid time and a half after a 40-hour workweek.
15558	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
15559	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Usually "exempt" is a relief, as in "exempt" from jury duty.
15560	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law.
15561	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The multibillion-dollar question is who is exempt and who gets paid.
15562	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.
15563	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services, professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low- level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.
15564	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In 2003, the Bush administration set out to "clarify" the law, revising income-level tests in various job categories (above them, you are a salaried manager and don't get overtime
15565	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	below them, you are not a manager and you do) and specifying that more than half a manager's time actually has to be spent managing.
15566	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But greater clarity was not necessarily a result.
15569	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Who's exempt?
15570	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
15571	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Let's take those one at a time.
15572	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The "who's eligible, who's exempt?"
15573	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	question is one increasingly heard in a courtroom.
15574	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
15575	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
15576	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It used to be, for instance, that to do personal errands (go to the bank, shop, pick up groceries), you had to leave the office at lunch.
15577	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk.
15578	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
15579	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
15580	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Or an e-mail message from a client?
15581	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And you respond?
15582	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Are you working again?
15584	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
15585	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone when you are technically off the clock?
15586	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"BlackBerry time is work time," said Dan McCoy, a partner in the employment practices group of Fenwick &amp
15587	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
15588	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	West, a law firm.
15589	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It absolutely counts."
15590	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
15591	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule.
15592	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And while the people most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too.
15593	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time."
15594	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if so many of us qualify for overtime, and there are so many opportunities for overtime, why aren't more of us getting more extra pay?
15595	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
15596	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
15597	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Of course, there are electronic records of work calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.
15598	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"It is daunting to keep an accurate record," said John Thompson, a partner in the Atlanta office of Fisher &amp
15599	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	amp
15600	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Phillips, a labor and employment firm.
15601	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"In a wireless world, nobody actually knows what the employee does or when he or she does it."
15602	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Put another way, many workers themselves can't even separate when they are working from when they are not.
15603	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
15604	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is illegal for a boss to send a message, directly or obliquely, that filing for overtime will be frowned upon, but it happens.
15605	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
15606	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
15607	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Plaintiffs' lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that workers wrongly classified as "exempt" are reluctant to change their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.
15609	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The company paid a substantial settlement, "then went back to doing things the old way," he said.
15610	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"I asked their lawyer 'Don't they know we're just going to sue them again?"'

15678	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They talked about empowering the poor and the working class, and about identities more complex than just black and white.
15681	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't mean that the fight is over, but the battlefield certainly has changed."
15682	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	To some, Obama's candidacy recalls the way King expanded his focus to include economic and foreign policy issues shortly before he was assassinated 40 years ago in Memphis, Tenn.
15684	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"They could not talk about economic issues.
15685	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	They could not talk about international affairs.
15689	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	And many of the organizations that commemorate the holiday are nonprofit groups that by law cannot endorse candidates.
15690	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Rather, Obama's name came up alongside King's as people declared that the civil rights leader was no longer a symbol only for blacks, or as they expressed hope that the two senators would resist temptations to focus the campaign on race and gender.
15692	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's so funny when someone tells the truth and they have to apologize for it," he said of Clinton.
15693	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"LBJ knew the redneck opposition and busted their kneecaps and broke their arms.
15694	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	So it was a collaboration between King and the civil rights movement and LBJ."
15695	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Debra Lesane, who is helping the Caribbean business group plan seminars on banking and credit, said at the breakfast that if King were alive today, he would be deploring the subprime mortgage crisis, which has disproportionately affected minority homeowners.
15697	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not good enough to have all the rights to engage in all the areas of commerce, if you don't have the ability," he said at the Nasdaq ceremony.
15698	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"What good is it to be able to sit at the lunch counter if you don't have the money to buy a hamburger?"
15699	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Economic issues also were at the forefront for people who felt disconnected from the holiday.
15701	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	But some baristas said they had never heard of the campaign by the union, which is fighting to organize them.
15705	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	"It's not just about African-Americans but about all minorities, how we're all treated," he said.
15706	NYT_ENG_20080121.0027.LDC2009T13	Nearby, Idris, 35, an immigrant from Ghana who declined to give his last name, said he could not take the holiday off because he is paid on commission for selling tour bus packages to passers- by.
15709	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	China's migrant workers cut adrift by global economic woes
15711	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue, 24, and his fiancee migrated from poor Shanxi province to coastal Fujian 14 months ago, dreaming of amassing a nest egg by working factory jobs.
15713	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We really don't know what to do.
15714	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We can't go home but there are fewer jobs here and they don't pay enough," said Xue, sitting dejectedly in a government jobs centre crowded with anxious unemployed workers.
15715	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Xue was let go by a machinery factory in this industrial town as foreign orders dried up.
15716	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"It's even worse in other places.
15717	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Everyone we know is desperate," he said.
15718	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	China's ruling Communist Party already grapples with thousands of violent public outbursts each year by marginalised people in society.
15719	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	And experts warn the problem could spike as more of China's estimated 200 million rural migrant workers lose their jobs.
15721	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the ILO expects "at least several million" new jobless due to the global crisis.
15723	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Clearly, measures have to be taken to ensure that doesn't happen," Thomas said.
15724	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	An estimated 30 million workers lost jobs from 1996-2004 as the government restructured state-owned companies, causing widespread protests and contributing to the masses of migrant workers today.
15726	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"Last time, the government could slow down layoffs if needed.
15727	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But now global forces are at work.
15728	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The leadership is very worried," he said.
15729	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The government this month announced a 586-billion-dollar package to counter the export pain with infrastructure and other projects that will create jobs.
15730	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The trouble has been most acute in southern Guangdong province, China's manufacturing heartland, where one-fifth of factories in major cities are expected to close by January alone, according to industry estimates.
15731	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Thousands of workers have gathered outside shuttered factories there, demanding unpaid wages, forcing local authorities to intervene.
15732	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But the pain is now spreading up the coast to places such as Tongan.
15733	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Gao Fengxiang, 42, came from central China's Hunan province in February to a factory job here.
15734	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Three weeks ago he was laid off and his employer and government officials have denied him required unemployment and medical insurance, he said.
15735	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"We have been cheated.
15737	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The shabby office is packed with jobless workers checking job advertisements offering 1,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan (about 175 to 370 dollars) -- about 50 percent less than earlier this year, Gao said.
15738	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"None of the jobs pay enough.
15739	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	We're abandoned," he said.
15740	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	The ILO's Thomas said China was ramping up re-training programmes and addressing holes in the social safety net.
15741	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	She expects big infrastructure projects to absorb many workers soon.
15742	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	But far more is needed, given the problem's scale, she said.
15743	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, many workers are giving up and heading home, according to statistics showing increased rail traffic from manufacturing regions.
15744	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	Lam called that "disturbing".
15745	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	"This hasn't happened before.
15746	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	After they return to Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei or wherever, they are unlikely to find work there.
15747	AFP_ENG_20081118.0662.LDC2009T13	So we may see more rural disturbances," he said.
15748	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Versatile jazz bassist and violinist Johnny Frigo, who co-wrote ' Detour Ahead, ' dies at 90
15750	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Johnny Frigo, a versatile jazz violinist and bassist who toured with Jimmy Dorsey and co-wrote the jazz standard "Detour Ahead," has died, according to his son.
15751	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	He was 90.
15752	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Frigo died early Wednesday at a Chicago hospital after battling cancer in recent years, said his son Rick Frigo.
15754	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	After playing with the U.S. Coast Guard band at Ellis Island during World War II, he toured with clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra.
15755	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Around that time, Frigo wrote "Detour Ahead" with Lou Carter and Herb Ellis, a song that became a jazz standard recorded by Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan, among others.
15756	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	He was in his late 60s or early 70s when he turned his attention to the violin, appearing twice on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson.
15757	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	"Nobody played violin like him," said his son.
15758	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	"Chicago's a poorer place without him."
15759	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	Frigo was also a poet and artist with a keen sense of humor, his son said.
15760	APW_ENG_20070705.1382.LDC2009T13	When Carson asked him why he had waited so long to launch his jazz violin career, he replied that he did not want there to be enough time for him to become a has-been, his son said.

15762	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 28 (Xinhua)
15765	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The good news is that this is 0.1 percent lower than the CPI- Food reported in December 2007 that showed a year-on-year increase of 13.5 percent," he said.
15766	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Food categories making the largest contribution to this increase include grain products, milk, cheese and eggs, fats and oils, fruits and nuts and vegetables.
15767	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Staple food items continue to increase at a relatively high rate.
15768	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Brown bread increased at 16.21 percent and white bread at 19.
15769	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	92 percent year-on-year.
15770	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The prices of a 5-kg bag of super and special maize meal increased by 22.29 percent and 28.00 percent respectively, year- on- year.
15771	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	The price of diary products on average increased by about a third, and vegetable products by just over a third.
15772	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other food products.
15773	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events," said Pieter.
15774	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity prices would remain high but stable.
15775	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this situation however.
15776	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Consumers were becoming risk averse because of pessimism around economic growth.
15777	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food was expected to decline.
15778	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Pieter said the steep rise in food prices could potentially decelerate.
15779	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure, favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and livestock markets.

15781	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	KUFA, Iraq
15783	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	In a sermon delivered before thousands of supporters in this Shiite Muslim holy city, the cleric presented himself as the champion of all Iraqis -- regardless of sect or creed.
15785	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials in Baghdad seemed surprised by al-Sadr's return, which comes at a key juncture in Iraq.
15786	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Officials in Iraq and Washington expressed uncertainty about his motives.
15788	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Members of al-Sadr's al-Mahdi militia staged two major uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004.
15789	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	But this year, the 33-year-old cleric has given tacit support to the U.S.-led security plan in Baghdad and surrounding areas, ordering his followers to pull back.
15790	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr's return to a public platform comes as frustration is mounting with the fractured government
15791	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	a 3-month-old security plan has made few inroads against withering violence
15792	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	and speculation is rife about how much longer U.S.-led forces will remain actively engaged.
15796	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Everybody is hovering around trying to get well-positioned for what comes after Maliki,'' Nasr said.
15797	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``And Sadr is probably the biggest player in that because he has a large chunk of the vote, and he controls the street.''
15798	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
15799	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
15800	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
15801	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.
15803	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
15804	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, al-Sadr's representatives in the Baghdad slum dubbed Sadr City, after his revered father, met with Sunni sheiks who have rallied against al-Qaida in nearby al-Anbar province.
15805	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
15806	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``It is not yet clear what he will do, but this puts him in a better position to game any crisis,'' Cordesman said.
15808	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``Iraq is now facing a severe crisis in all aspects, politically, economically and security wise,'' he said.
15809	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``We as a political movement are trying to get the country out of the bottleneck.''
15810	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have said that al-Sadr fled to Iran ahead of the U.S. troop buildup that began Feb. 13.
15812	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was surrounded by aides and guards when he arrived at the western gate of the Kufa mosque to deliver the midday sermon for the first time in more than four months.
15813	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	An emotional crowd surged forward and showered him with candies.
15814	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He began the sermon with the familiar anti-American rhetoric on which he has built his nationalist credentials.
15815	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He asked his followers to chant three times, ``No to injustice.
15816	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to Israel.
15817	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to America.
15818	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	No to the devils.''
15819	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``I renew my request that the occupiers should withdraw or schedule their withdrawal,'' said al-Sadr, who appeared in his traditional black robes and turban.
15820	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	``The government should not allow the occupiers to extend their stay in Iraq, not even for one more day.''
15821	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr said he stood ready to defend Sunnis and Christians who have been targeted by extremists, even as he underlined his displeasure with proposals to re-integrate members of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arab regime into the government and civil service -- one of the benchmarks for continued U.S. support.
15822	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Fakhrildeen reported from Kufa and Zavis reported from Baghdad.

15827	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Congestion Pricing: Transportation Department's Plan to Cut Flight Delays Is a Short-Term Fix
15828	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
15829	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
15830	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
15831	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
15832	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	But this short-term fix is not enough.
15833	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Upgrading the air traffic control system is the real solution to America's air-travel woes.
15834	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
15835	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	In announcing the policy, the Transportation Department noted that the number of arrival delays exceeding one hour there increased by 114 percent in the first 10 months of fiscal 2007.
15836	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
15837	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
15838	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
15839	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
15840	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
15841	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The incentive for airport operators is that they can factor into their fees the reasonable costs associated with runway and other facility improvements that would ultimately aid in reducing delays.
15842	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.
15844	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Federal Aviation Administration has been waiting for nearly a year for Congress to fund a state-of-the-art satellite navigation system that would allow pilots and controllers to use air space more efficiently.

15850	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Jurors deliberated much of Friday evening before convicting Pfc. Jesse Spielman, 22, of conspiracy to commit rape, rape, housebreaking with intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder, despite testimony that cast doubt on his involvement.
15852	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He was charged in connection with the March 12, 2006, rape and slaying of Abeer Qassim al-Janabi and the killings of her family.
15853	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The attack took place in Mahmoudiya, a village about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Baghdad.
15854	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Military prosecutors did not say Spielman took part in the rape or murders, but alleged he went to the house knowing what the others intended to do and served as a lookout.
15855	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman had pleaded guilty on Monday to lesser charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, arson, wrongfully touching a corpse and drinking.
15857	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Soldiers in Spielman's unit fanned the woman with napkins.
15858	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spielman's sister, Paige Gerlach, screamed: "I hate the government.
15860	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Defense attorneys left the courthouse immediately following the verdict and could not immediately be reached for comment.
15861	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors rested their case Thursday amid struggles to overcome a fellow soldier's recanting of a story that Spielman acted as a lookout during the attack last year.
15862	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Spc. James Barker, who has admitted his own role in the assault, said in earlier testimony that he had allowed investigators to draft sworn statements for him that implicated Spielman in the crime.
15863	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker testified Wednesday that several portions of the document were untrue, including references to Spielman's role in the conspiracy to attack the family and his knowledge of plans to rape the girl.
15864	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	But another soldier convicted in the attack, Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, testified that Spielman stood guard as his fellow soldiers raped the girl.
15865	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Cortez said Spielman was within a few feet of the others as they held down the screaming girl but did nothing to stop them.
15866	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker, Cortez and another soldier, Pfc. Bryan L. Howard, pleaded guilty for their roles in the slayings and received sentences of five to 100 years under plea agreements with prosecutors.
15867	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Steven D. Green, who was discharged from the Army before being charged, faces a possible death sentence when he is tried in federal court in Kentucky.
15868	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include murder and sexual assault.
15869	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Barker and Cortez have given investigators conflicting statements about whether Spielman knew of the plan to rape the girl and was present when they discussed it over swigs from bottles of whiskey and gin mixed with energy drinks, according to testimony.
15870	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	During their courts-martial, Barker and Cortez testified they took turns raping the girl while Green shot and killed her mother, father and younger sister.
15871	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	Green shot the girl in the head after raping her, they said.
15872	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	The girl's body was set on fire with kerosene to destroy the evidence, according to previous testimony.

15885	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The source said the boy had lost consciousness during his six days in police detention, apparently after being violently beaten.
15887	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	The report was based on individual testimonies, legal cases and medical and autopsy reports and included 26 cases of police torture recorded this year alone, which resulted in three deaths.
15888	AFP_ENG_20070812.0053.LDC2009T13	According to London-based Amnesty International, torture in detention is systematic in Egypt and, in the majority of cases, the perpetrators are not brought to justice.

16016	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in talks to invest in a wireless company based on WiMax technology, according to a source familiar with the talks.
16017	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The company would be operated by Sprint Nextel and Clearwire, which have focused over the past year on building a network based on WiMax, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.
16018	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	With the new company, the cable providers would be taking direct aim at the nation's biggest wireless carriers, Verizon Communications and AT&amp
16019	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	T, which have pushed aggressively into Internet and television services.
16020	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast would invest $1 billion and Time Warner would put as much as $500 million into the venture to create a next-generation, high-speed wireless network spanning the nation, according to the source.
16021	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Comcast and Sprint declined to comment on speculation about the negotiations.
16023	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Verizon entered into competition with Comcast and Time Warner Cable through its FiOS fiber-optic network, which offers television services.
16024	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"Comcast and Time Warner are home-, broadband- and PC-oriented, so WiMax as a choice to get into wireless makes sense for them," Ask said.
16025	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	"But whether or not they should be their own network or lease capacity from Sprint or Clearwire is something for Wall Street analysts to judge."
16026	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Intel and Google are also involved in the discussions about the new venture, according to the source.
16027	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	The companies have signaled their interest in joining with Sprint and Clearwire to form a WiMax nationwide network.
16028	LTW_ENG_20080326.0132.LDC2009T13	Sprint and Clearwire have been trying to raise $3 billion to build a WiMax network.

16095	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The victims were members of a small Kurdish sect -- the Yazidis -- sometimes attacked by Muslim extremists who consider them infidels.
16096	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Four suicide truck bombers struck nearly simultaneously on Tuesday, killing more people than any other concerted attack since Nov. 23, when 215 people were killed by mortar fire and five car bombs in Baghdad's Shiite Muslim enclave of Sadr City.
16097	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	It was most vicious attack yet against the Yazidis, an ancient religious community in the region.

16106	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The bombings came as extremists staged other bold attacks on Tuesday: leveling a key bridge outside Baghdad and abducting five officials from an Oil Ministry compound in the capital in a raid using gunmen dressed as security officers.
16107	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	Nine U.S. soldiers also were reported killed, including five in a helicopter crash.

16115	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Yazidis comprise a primarily Kurdish religious sect with ancient roots, that worships an angel figure considered to be the devil by some Muslims and Christians.

16117	APW_ENG_20070815.0586.LDC2009T13	The Islamic State in Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, distributed leaflets a week ago warning residents near the scene of Tuesday's bombings that an attack was imminent because Yazidis are "anti- Islamic."

16156	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	General John Craddock, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR), feels "that it's a very natural thing to do, contingency planning, because that's something that a military alliance should be in the regular business of doing," the official said.
16157	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Article Five of NATO's charter guarantees that the alliance will come to the defense of any member who is attacked.
16159	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The general is considering conducting a risk assessment first, followed by contingency planning, the official said.
16160	AFP_ENG_20081006.0189.LDC2009T13	The official said Craddock did not need permission to do contingency planning but had gone to Scheffer "just to get a sort of signal pulse on that."

16181	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Rangers boss Walter Smith on Friday welcomed a UEFA decision to take no action against Barry Ferguson over an altercation with a Hapoel Tel Aviv player in the club's UEFA Cup defeat in Israel this week.
16182	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	Gers captain Ferguson appeared to strike Hapoel's Tal Chen after being floored by Luciano De Bruno during the 2-1 first leg defeat on Wednesday, and afterwards Hapoel's coach Nir Levin called on UEFA to look at the incident.
16183	AFP_ENG_20070216.0264.LDC2009T13	But European football's governing body have since confirmed to Rangers that they will not be taking the matter further, ensuring Ferguson will not be banned for the return leg at Ibrox next week.

16190	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups lashed out at Myanmar's military leaders for evicting cyclone refugees from relief camps and forcing them back to their isolated, storm-shattered homes.
16191	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	A U.N. official said Friday the government was the making cyclone survivors leave the camps and "dumping" them near their devastated villages with virtually no aid supplies.
16192	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said in a release Saturday that hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced people had also been expelled from schools, monasteries and public buildings.
16194	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Another group, Refugees International, said authorities appear to be trying to get villagers back to their land to begin tending their fields and reviving agriculture.
16195	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.
16196	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Eight camps set up for homeless survivors in the Irrawaddy delta town of Bogalay were "totally empty" as the clear-out continued, said Teh Tai Ring of the United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- at a meeting of U.N. and private aid agency workers discussing water and sanitation issues.
16197	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"The government is moving people unannounced," he said, adding that authorities were "dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing."
16198	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	After his statement was reported, UNICEF issued a statement saying the remarks referred to "unconfirmed reports by relief workers on the relocation of displaced people affected by" the May 2-3 storm.
16199	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said the information came from a relief worker who had just returned from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he recounted his findings earlier in the day.
16200	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Separately, at a church in Yangon, more than 400 cyclone victims from a delta township, Labutta, were evicted Friday following orders from authorities a day earlier.
16201	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"It was a scene of sadness, despair and pain," said a church official at the Yangon Karen Baptist Home Missions in Yangon, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of official reprisal.
16202	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.
16203	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They have no home to go back to."
16204	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young children and those with severe illnesses left the church in eleven trucks Friday morning.
16205	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The authorities told church workers that the victims would first be taken to a government camp in Myaung Mya -- a mostly undamaged town in the Irrawaddy delta -- but it was not immediately clear when they would be resettled in their villages.
16206	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid groups meanwhile said Myanmar's military government was hindering foreign assistance for victims of the cyclone, despite a promise to U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon to ease travel restrictions.
16207	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.
16208	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	They said the International Red Cross was waiting for permission to send 30 foreign staffers into the delta.

16211	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations and then they are forced to move."
16212	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	But others were being denied such aid because they had lost their government identity cards, he said.
16213	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it was time for "reconstruction."
16214	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Foreign aid experts disagree, arguing that many people are still in need of emergency assistance for food and shelter, as well as medical care.
16215	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Aid workers who have reached some of the remote villages say little remains that could sustain the former residents.

16225	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	News Analysis: Financial crisis sends eurozone economy to brink of recession
16226	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, Oct. 9 (Xinhua)
16227	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The eurozone economy is now on the brink of recession as the financial crisis is devastating the 15-nation bloc sharing the euro currency.
16228	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	For the first time, economic growth in the eurozone recorded a quarterly decrease in the three months from April to June this year, figures from the European Union (EU)'s statistics bureau Eurostat showed Wednesday.
16229	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	But things have been getting worse after the negative growth in the second quarter, mainly due to the escalating financial crisis, which suggests that there is little chance of the eurozone economy rebounding in the following months.
16230	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In technical terms, recession means negative growth in two consecutive quarters.
16231	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	As EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday, forecasts of a recession in Europe and the United States could become the "central scenario."
16232	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Forecasts for recessions on both sides of the Atlantic "run the risk of becoming the central scenario in the coming months," Almunia told a conference in Madrid, Spain.
16233	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The financial crisis, which originated in the United States, has deepened in Europe in recent weeks, with several European banks falling prey to the global credit crunch, prompting EU governments to save their banks by injecting large amounts of money or even nationalizing them.
16234	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Without any knowledge of which one would be the next victim, financial institutions in the eurozone have become extremely reluctant to lend to each other, resulting in a more serious credit crunch.
16235	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Despite furious efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject liquidity into the financial markets, no big turn was observed.
16236	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Economists fear that a prolonged money market freeze would have a significant impact on overall lending to businesses and individuals, undermining confidence and threatening the real economy.
16237	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Figures from the European Commission showed that economic confidence in the eurozone continued to fall in September, hitting the lowest level since November 2001, i.e. shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, while the business climate decreased significantly to values last observed in 2003.
16238	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Last month, Almunia warned that the financial crisis is hurting Europe's real economy.

16240	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Almunia said the effects of the financial turmoil have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and the severe housing market corrections in some EU member states.
16241	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"This combination of shocks has impacted directly on economic activity via higher costs and negative wealth effects and indirectly via a sharp erosion of economic confidence," he said.
16242	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"The result has been a break on domestic demand at a time when external demand is fading," he added.
16243	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	With the threat of the financial crisis on one side, the eurozone economy also faced inflation which remained stubbornly high at 3.6 percent.
16244	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Frankfurt-based ECB prefers a ceiling of 2 percent to maintain price stability.
16245	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	High inflation erodes purchasing power of every family, dampening private consumption, a key driver behind eurozone economic growth.
16246	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Official figures showed that consumption expenditure, investment and exports, the three major economic engines in the eurozone, all cooled down in the second quarter, decreasing from the previous three months by 0.2, 1.0 and 0.2 percent respectively.
16248	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	So far, Ireland and France have fallen into recession.
16249	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Analysts warned that with no sign of recovery, recession is just around the corner for the eurozone.
16250	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Early September, the European Commission revised down its forecast for eurozone economic growth this year by 0.4 percentage points to 1.3 percent.
16251	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	At that time, it was stressed that risks to the growth outlook were on the downside.
16252	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Commission said the dramatic events in the financial markets in the last few weeks are reinforcing that view.
16253	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In an emergent bid to restore confidence and avoid an economic crash, the ECB abandoned its long-time hawkish policy of refusing to lower its interest rate and joined hands with the world's major central banks Wednesday by cutting its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage points.

16261	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	However the Obamas decide to proceed, they'll have to follow a few basic rules.
16262	NYT_ENG_20081217.0189.LDC2009T13	For starters, they will have to pay for their own movers.

16272	XIN_ENG_20070429.0052.LDC2009T13	An unidentified group, on Sunday, detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) targeting a vehicle carrying journalists in eastern Nepal, reported the website nepalnews.com.
16273	XIN_ENG_20070429.0052.LDC2009T13	The website reported that two persons traveling on a motorbike from opposite direction hurled the bomb at the micro bus carrying six journalists at Sunsari District, some 220 km east of Kathmandu.
16274	XIN_ENG_20070429.0052.LDC2009T13	The journalists were on their way to cover a meeting addressed by Minister for Foreign affairs Sahana Pradhan at a local school.
16275	XIN_ENG_20070429.0052.LDC2009T13	However, there was no human casualty in the incident as the vehicle was not hit by the bomb.
16278	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's inhuman to ask somebody like me to go back to my 'real home land', I don't even know my real home land," said Nancy, a Kikuyu woman from the Eldoret area in western Kenya.
16280	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Nancy, 47, said she had no intention of leaving the area where her family has lived for more than three generations to move to the Kikuyu heartland, in central Kenya.

16283	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	When Kibaki was declared the winner of the election on December 30 despite mounting evidence of fraud, several tribes turned against the Kikuyus.
16284	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Dozens were speared and hacked to death in raids on villages in the Eldoret area.
16285	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Refugees were also targeted, notably when a church in Eldoret housing displaced Kikuyu families was deliberately set on fire, killing at least 35 people.
16286	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Local residents and observers have argued that in regions where feelings of marginalisation were strongest, tribal vindication was encouraged by campaigns using the long obsolete term of "majimbo".
16287	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Majimbo -- a Kiswahili term which implies a form of federalism, decentralisation and devolution -- featured in Odinga's campaign, although it was never clearly defined.
16288	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Most of the attacks against Kikuyus in the Eldoret area were carried out by Kalenjin, one of the dominant tribes in the area, who squarely supported Odinga and are represented in parliament by his right-hand man William Ruto.
16289	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of the country's tribes rallied behind Odinga, amid resentment at Kibaki and his Kikuyu entourage, seen as an arrogant and corrupt elite.
16290	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Stephen, who was displaced by the deadly violence that followed the elections and now lives in a camp some 20 miles from Eldoret, said that majimbo was understood by some as a license for ethnic cleansing.
16291	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"They did not understand that the term majimbo means sharing of resources and power, brought to people on the ground," he said.
16292	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"According to them, it's cleaning and removing tribes from Kalenjin ancestral land," Stephen added, quivering because of the cold.
16294	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of Eldoret's Kikuyus settled the fertile region after the 1963 independence, with the support of their leader and the country's first president Jomo Kenyatta.

16296	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's not what they told the media, which was 'equal distribution of national ressources'," added John, a nurse.

16302	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ANC-dominated parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of effecting Mbeki's resignation from Thursday, September 25, with only 10 votes against the motion.
16304	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Parliament will on Thursday vote on his election, and he will be sworn in later in the day.
16305	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he says cost him his job as president.
16306	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	In a September 12 ruling, judge Chris Nicholson dismissed a corruption case against Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma, hinting that Mbeki had interfered in the decision to prosecute his foe.
16307	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, 66, who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in June 1999, becomes the country's first democratically elected president to be forced out of office before the end of his term.
16308	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter," said Mbeki in his application.
16309	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified," he added.
16310	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC -- a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years," Mbeki said.
16311	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice," he added.
16312	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The court ruling that was to prove Mbeki's final downfall found that the executive might have interfered in the decision to prosecute the ANC chief.
16313	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"I am not convinced that the applicant (Zuma) was incorrect in averring political meddling in his prosecution," said Nicholson.
16314	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	He was ruling on an application by the state to strike out sections of an affidavit filed by Zuma's legal team that insinuated political interference in the decision to charge him.
16315	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki had been increasingly at loggerheads with his party, which split into two camps behind him and Zuma, after deciding to run for a third term as party president at a crunch ANC conference in December last year.
16316	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Zuma toppled him as chief at the conference, and is the frontronner to be president after elections in April 2009.
16317	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	The ruling throwing out corruption charges against Zuma led to a week of heavy political debate, and a lengthy meeting by the ANC executive who decided on Saturday to "recall" Mbeki in the interests of party unity.
16318	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	When announcing his resignation in a live address on Sunday, Mbeki denied he had " compromised the right of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to decide whom it should prosecute and not prosecute."
16321	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	"The interim president and his or her team will have to carefully manage the transition so as to not worsen already weak investor sentiment and add to macroeconomic risks," it said.
16322	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Motlanthe, who will take over from Thursday as president, is considered a key ANC strategist who has appealed to supporters of both Mbeki and the outgoing president's rival Jacob Zuma.

16547	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders issued a special statement on the financial crisis Saturday, vowing to take action "individually and collectively" to restore confidence in their economies and keep the region moving along the path of long-term growth.
16548	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We have already taken urgent and extraordinary steps to stabilize our financial sectors and strengthen economic growth and promote investment and consumption," the statement said.
16549	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to take such steps and work closely, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner, to implement future actions to address this crisis," it added.
16550	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders specifically pledged support for efforts by export credit agencies, international financial institutions and private banks to ensure that adequate finance is available to businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and to keep trade and investment flowing in the region.
16551	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	They also welcomed continued development and innovation in the financial sector, while calling for more effective regulatory and supervisory tools as financial systems become more complex.
16552	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The APEC leaders also expressed support for the Washington Declaration adopted at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month and the common principles that will guide the Action Plan for financial markets reform.
16553	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	As one of the world's biggest regional blocs with a wide geographical span and huge diversity among its members, APEC has sent a strong signal that world economies are ready to do everything possible to stave off the crisis and restore market confidence, analysts say.

16555	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	During the meeting, the leaders highlighted the urgency to curb any upturn of protectionism that could arise from the crisis and exacerbate the current economic situation.
16556	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders reiterated their "firm belief that free market principles, and open trade and investment regimes will continue to drive global growth, employment and poverty reduction."
16557	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On Saturday, they promised not to raise new barriers to investment and trade in the next 12 months.
16558	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We...will refrain within the next 12 months from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services, imposing new export restrictions, or implementing World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent measures in all areas, including those that stimulate exports," the statement said.
16559	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	On the Doha round of trade talks, APEC leaders expressed their hope for "an ambitious and balanced conclusion" to lay the foundation for the economic growth and prosperity in the region.
16560	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We are committed to reach agreement on modalities next month on the basis of progress made to date," they added.
16561	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The strong call by the leaders for free trade and rejection of protectionism indicates that world economies are determined to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s when "a wrong approach" was taken, as U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said.
16562	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
16563	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	One of the highlights of the APEC Leaders' Week from Nov. 16-23 was the leaders' efforts to explore the social dimension of APEC, especially corporate social responsibility, amid the crisis.
16564	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"The crisis also highlights the need to develop more effective standards of corporate governance and risk management as well as the importance of social responsibility in the financial sector," the statement said.
16565	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The leaders urged companies to incorporate social responsibility into their business strategies to take account of social, labor and environmental concerns.
16566	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	Such a move is likely to boost confidence among investors and consumers who have accused some companies of a reckless pursuit of profits, which triggered the financial meltdown, analysts say.

16588	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK - The word "courage" gets tossed around a lot in sports, often in reference to a player who makes an important shot or sinks a winning putt.
16589	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	We gained a new appreciation for the term when we visited the Sports Museum of America and read about Aja Frary.
16590	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	When she was 15, her stepfather tried to force her to give up sports.
16591	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Frary refused and left home, moving in with her grandparents.
16593	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	We also learned about a dad in California who questioned his daughter's team being booted off a field so a boys' squad could practice, and found that local facilities for girls were sorely lacking.
16596	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Craig, 51, an honorary trustee, helped usher the museum into its historic space in the Financial District two months ago.

16607	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Some people would minimize sports' role in our culture," said Philip Schwalb, the museum's founder.
16608	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"But my goal, going back 6?
16609	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	years now, is to show the power of sports to impact lives."
16610	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb's life changed in a matter of 24 hours, when he visited the Basketball Hall of Fame for the first time on Sept. 10, 2001 (his 39th birthday), and lamented the absence of an all-sports museum in the United States.
16611	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The attacks the next day spurred him to pursue his goal of a museum that would celebrate all sports, and to build it in Manhattan.
16612	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Sixteen months later, the Basketball Hall of Fame became the first partner.
16613	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb speaks warmly of the first athlete to join the advisory board, Celtics legend Bob Cousy.
16614	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We call Bob our patron saint," said Schwalb.
16615	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Cousy, a New York native, was also the subject of a rallying cry when the fledgling museum was trying to gain its footing.
16616	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The mayor had given us the use of Gracie Mansion for a meeting with the deputy mayor for economic development, and we wanted noteworthy athletes to join us," said Schwalb.
16617	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We had four or five lined up, but as time went on the others kept canceling.
16618	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Finally, only Cousy was left, so our slogan was 'Don't lose the Cooz."'
16619	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Another Hall of Famer, Bill Bradley, steered the project toward Lower Manhattan, which resulted in Schwalb's group securing Liberty bonds, part of a federal initiative to revitalize the area.
16620	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Just a dozen or so businesses out of some 300 applicants won approval, and that landed the museum $60 million of its required $100 million.
16622	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Imagine coming home one day to find a voice mail from him about our project."
16623	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The 19 galleries brim with the top players in the leading sports.
16624	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb worked to align the museum with every important governing body and hall of fame, and he landed the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., just a month before opening.
16625	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	What did those organizations have to gain?
16626	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	As in many sports stories, the statistics are telling.
16627	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"In the case of the Basketball Hall of Fame, they work hard, they hold special events, and they get just over 100,000 visitors a year," says Schwalb.
16628	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"There must be what, 30 million basketball fans in this country?
16629	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	And a lot of them don't even know the Hall of Fame is in Springfield."
16630	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	Schwalb estimates that an annual 7 million visitors make their way to Battery Park and its ferries to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
16631	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum is about 50 yards from the park, right across the street from the famous "charging bull" statue symbolic of Wall Street, a couple of blocks from Ground Zero, and at the starting point for ticker-tape parades down Broadway, the mile-long "Canyon of Heroes" leading to City Hall.
16633	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"We also have a photo of Jesse Owens in a convertible during his parade in 1936 that was taken directly in front of our building," said Schwalb.
16634	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum sits at 26 Broadway and boasts a commanding presence in the historic former headquarters of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co.
16635	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"The building is unlike any other we could find," said Schwalb.
16636	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"Its facade is 450 feet long, and you'd be hard-pressed to find another building of that length in New York City."
16638	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"They were determined to have a physical space for their hall of fame," said Schwalb.
16639	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"For 20 years they would have an induction dinner, and they never had a place to honor the inductees."
16640	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	The museum provides several interactive touches: Fans can lend the announcer's voice to some classic moments, get behind a hockey goalie's mask and see a forward bearing down on them with the puck, gauge their cycling ability, even take a shot at changing the tires like a member of a pit crew.
16641	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	At the final kiosk, visitors can learn more about how to visit the various halls of fame and get on their e-mail lists.
16642	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"It's better than a single hall of fame and more than a museum," said Craig.
16643	NYT_ENG_20080715.0116.LDC2009T13	"I call it a destination for dreams."

16669	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The skirmishing is an indication of the rising anxiety on all sides in the remaining few weeks before the presentation of what is widely considered a make-or-break assessment of Bush's war strategy, and one that will come amid rising calls for a drawdown of U.S. forces from Iraq.
16670	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	With the report due by Sept. 15, officials at the White House, in Congress and in Baghdad said that no decisions have been made on where, when or how Petraeus and Crocker will appear before Congress.
16672	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
16676	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
16677	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``Americans deserve an even-handed assessment of conditions in Iraq.
16680	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
16681	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
16682	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
16683	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
16684	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	But both the White House and Congress have widely described the assessment as coming from Petraeus.
16685	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
16686	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
16689	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
16690	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the two may not be appearing in public.
16691	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	They said they will continue to prepare for the testimony in the absence of instructions from Washington.
16693	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
16694	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
16695	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The spokesman for Levin said that he expects at least Petraeus to testify before the Armed Services Committee but would be happy to have Crocker as well.
16696	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.
16699	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, said that the chiefs are making their own assessment of the situation in Iraq and will present it to Bush in the next few weeks.

16703	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
16704	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
16705	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
16708	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
16709	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"I do feel vindicated," he added.
16710	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"It restored my faith in the legal system.
16711	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The jury paid close attention."
16712	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the big guy.
16713	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	It's one of these things where the system works for a change."
16714	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing.
16715	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
16716	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
16717	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit, Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay for $1.3 million.
16718	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
16719	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000 for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
16720	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t preemptively sued Shugart in February 2006 to keep him from selling any of those images or restricting Prop?t's rights to them.
16721	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
16722	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
16723	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann and Shugart couldn't account for the fact that the total value of the jury award equaled the amount Shugart had planned to seek for the images on eBay.
16724	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence or not, I don't know," Mann said.
16725	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case, "so far as we know," is the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Mann said.
16726	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
16727	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
16728	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image, but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered.
16729	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
16730	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"The axiom that the copyright is created when the image is created means nothing."
16733	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The data spooked some pundits and Wall Street investors who had hoped that receding inflation could set the stage for a Fed rate cut sometime this year.
16735	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
16736	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
16737	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	On a year-on-year basis, the headline consumer price index was up 2.1 percent and the core CPI rose 2.7 percent.
16738	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Fed's official forecast calls for core inflation to be in a range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent for 2007.
16739	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	That is slightly above what economists see as the central bank's "comfort zone" of under 2.0 percent.
16741	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
16742	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"In order for this expansion to continue in a sustainable way, inflation needs to be well controlled," he said.
16743	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates."
16744	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	And minutes from the January 31 meeting of the Fed's policy committee, released Wednesday, showed that Bernanke and his colleagues "did not yet see a downtrend in core inflation as definitively established."
16745	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
16747	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large 0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest such reading since August 1991," he said.
16748	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the second half of the year."
16749	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April 2005.
16750	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
16751	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"Yes, there are some strange elements in it but you cannot simply exclude the ones you don't like in the months that don't come out the way you like it."
16753	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"And investors should start asking what they should expect for long-term inflation.
16754	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."
16755	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	In other news Wednesday, the private-sector Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators, a gauge of activity in the coming six to nine months, rose just 0.1 percent last month.
16756	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But the December reading was revised up to 0.6 percent.

16759	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel threatened on Sunday to launch a major offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip as violence simmered around the impoverished territory days after the end of a truce with the Islamists.
16760	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The two frontrunners in the race to become prime minister after a snap election in February both vowed to topple Hamas, which has run Gaza since violently seizing power there in June 2007.

16775	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some damage.
16778	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Since then, Gaza militants have launched several dozen rockets, causing some damage and slightly wounding a handful of civilians, and Israel has retaliated with air strikes, killing one militant and several other Palestinians.
16781	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	"And worse than that, to be accused of having ordered a military operation just to improve their chances at the ballot box," he said.
16782	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	Israel responded to violence that erupted around Gaza in early November by tightening its blockade of the territory and halting deliveries of humanitarian aid and other basic supplies.

16808	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Report: Deutsche Telekom CEO asks for patience from shareholders
16809	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	BERLIN 2008-05-11 13:03:15 UTC
16810	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Deutsche Telekom AG's chief executive has asked that shareholders show patience, pointing to the global credit crisis as a reason for the company's lackluster share price, according to an interview published Sunday.
16811	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Rene Obermann took over as head of Europe's biggest telecom company in late 2006.
16812	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Last week, the company reported a rise in first-quarter net profit but a decline in revenue.
16813	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Telekom shares, worth nearly euro13.50 when Obermann took over, closed at euro11.81 (US$18.29) on Friday.
16814	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"I want to show shareholders what great potential our company has
16815	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	and I want to make clear how great an effort we are making to increase the value of the company," Obermann was quoted as telling the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
16816	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	However, "I can't perform magic," he added.
16817	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"This is hard work that requires trust and patience."
16818	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann noted that Telekom shares performed strongly until January.
16819	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"Only with the credit crisis did the whole industry -- so our competitors as well -- fall back," he added, according to the report.
16820	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann said that his company's marketing of Apple's iPhone in Germany, where it is available only with a two-year contract from Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile unit, has been "attractive and profitable."
16821	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	He was quoted as saying that it has sold more than 100,000 of the devices in Germany so far.
16822	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	Obermann brushed aside a question as to whether Deutsche Telekom wants to buy U.S. mobile phone rival Sprint Nextel Corp.
16823	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"It is our general policy not to comment on such market rumors," he said.
16824	APW_ENG_20080511.0383.LDC2009T13	"That would be irresponsible."

16872	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	My dilemma: Should I trudge through shin-deep snow to the side door at the Kilmorey Lodge library?
16873	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Or should I use the front door, shooing away the doe and her fawn that have taken shelter there from the falling snow?
16874	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	I opt for the library door.
16876	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This is their home
16877	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	we are merely visitors.
16879	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It also receives thousands of visitors who come north across the U.S. border as part of their visit to Glacier National Park, which abuts it.
16880	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Together, they form the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
16881	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But in winter, Glacier is essentially shut down.
16882	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Its hotels and restaurants are closed and boarded up, its high mountain roads buried by deep, drifting snow.
16883	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The border crossing that is the summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until summer.
16885	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The grocery store and the gas station are boarded up
16886	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	so is the fudge shop, the espresso bar and the ice cream parlor.
16887	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The summer population of more than 2,000 shrinks to perhaps 100, many of them park staff.
16888	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And even many residents in nearby Montana assume Waterton has joined Glacier in winter slumber.
16889	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make the offseason trek.
16890	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We are here this weekend because the Kilmorey Lodge tops our list of places where we most want to be snowed in.
16891	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Our cross-country skis are strapped on the car, and our snowshoes are in the trunk.
16892	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We seek a blend of adventure and solitude, but also a comfortable bed, a warm fire, and gourmet meals served by cheerful and attentive staff.
16893	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Kilmorey offers it all.
16894	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Adventure isn't far away.
16895	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton plows a road eight miles (13 kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the Rockies.
16896	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	From there the remaining two miles (three kilometers) of unplowed road lead cross-country skiers or snowshoers to Cameron Lake, nestled in a cirque at 5,450 feet (1,660 meters) hard against the Continental Divide.
16898	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers.
16899	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	And all around are forest and mountains, inviting explorers on snowshoes.
16900	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Back down in the townsite is Cameron Falls, a spectacular waterfall on the edge of town that in winter is an easy destination for skiers who want an adventure a bit short of true wilderness.
16901	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of trees near the Kilmorey.
16902	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	A small herd of Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep also frequents the townsite.
16903	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Lucky visitors may even catch a glimpse of a mountain lion, searching for winter prey.
16904	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating this time of year and pose no threat.
16905	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895.
16907	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others in Glacier park.
16909	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It still overlooks the village of Waterton, and staying there is a highlight for many summer visitors.
16910	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is closed in winter, and few even venture there because of the fierce and frigid winds that can howl down Upper Waterton Lake.
16911	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Those that do visit the Prince of Wales can see the thick steel cables that literally keep the huge hotel from blowing away.
16912	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
16914	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Evening comes early in winter, and the glow from the lodge windows is an invitation.
16915	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Just off the lobby is a small, cheery pub where we can sit by the fireplace and look out over the snowy wilderness.
16916	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	As in many old inns, the rooms are each unique and range from cozy to spacious.
16917	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But all have antique furniture, plump mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and sleep late.
16918	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The rooms have no televisions, telephones or dataports, and there is no cell phone service
16919	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	this is not the place for such intrusions.
16920	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Dining at Kilmorey is a treat
16922	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
16925	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood- burning fireplace.
16926	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	You can choose to take your coffee and dessert here after dinner.
16927	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But it's always a quiet refuge, the perfect place to curl up with a good book, listen to the crackle of the fire and watch the softly falling snow deepen outside the door.
16928	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Perhaps we'll be snowed in.
16929	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We can always hope.

16949	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the difference," Crosby said.
16950	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	After scoring one goal on nine power-play chances in the first three games of the series, all won by the Penguins, Philadelphia scored two power-play goals and avoided being swept from the Eastern Conference finals.
16951	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Game 5 is scheduled for Sunday in Pittsburgh.
16952	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Philadelphia goaltender Martin Biron stopped 36 of 38 shots against the Penguins, who had won 11 of their first 12 playoff games.
16954	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to seal the victory.
16955	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	It was the second goal of the game for Lupul.
16956	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
16957	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval, the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
16958	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh penalty box.
16959	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' other elite center.
16960	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Stevens juggled his line combinations, placing Richards on his stagnant top line, which includes Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell.
16961	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Vinny Prospal centered a line with R.J. Umberger and Lupul.
16962	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere said he and Richards had chemistry on the power play throughout the year.
16963	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I thought, wow, maybe that could work five-on-five," Briere said.
16964	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"So I was excited and enthusiastic about the idea."
16965	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Thirty seconds after a tripping penalty on Briere ended early in the first period, Lupul stormed into the Penguins' zone and took a slap shot at goaltender Marc-Andr?
16966	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury before he reached the face-off circle.
16967	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh defenseman Hal Gill.
16968	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Fleury flinched his left shoulder to try to stop the shot, but the puck went in 8:27 into the first.
16969	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The crowd howled when Briere, pounded by the Penguins in the series, was tripped by defenseman Sergei Gonchar, and Gonchar was called for a penalty.
16970	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers scored on the power play, when Briere swept in the rebound of a slap shot by defenseman Randy Jones at 11:48.
16971	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Briere reached the puck before Gill and knocked in his ninth playoff goal as Gill was knocking him to the ice.
16972	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"I think we had a tough time containing them in front," Staal said.
16973	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They're strong players."
16974	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Pittsburgh defenseman Brooks Orpik picked up a roughing penalty late in the first, and Jeff Carter scored a power-play goal with 1:10 left in the period by flicking in the rebound of a hard shot by Umberger, making the score 3-0.
16975	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	At the midway point of the first period, the Flyers had been outshot by the Penguins, 11-4.
16976	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Philadelphia ended the period with a 17-13 edge in shots.
16977	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The Flyers had eight shots through the first two periods of a 4-1 loss in Game 3 on Tuesday.
16978	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they've got offensive power," Biron said.
16979	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they can come up and score any time in the game.
16980	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	To have played the way we played in the first period really gave us a chance to be ready for their two goals in the third period.
16981	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	That gave us a cushion."
16982	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	BRAZILIAN NUMBERS GAME TIES OFFICIALS TO MOBSTERS
16984	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The illegal lottery known as "the animal game" is as visible a part of the urban landscape here as Ipanema beach or Sugarloaf Mountain.
16985	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	On thousands of street corners, vendors sit all day at little wooden booths, pads of paper in hand, taking money from bettors, who return later to check results posted on lampposts or walls.
16986	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The bosses of the billion-dollar industry known in Portuguese as the "jogo do bicho," on the other hand, have long preferred to operate in the shadows.
16987	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That was, at least, until a burgeoning corruption scandal suddenly thrust them into an uncomfortable national spotlight.
16988	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game.
16989	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	More than 40 people face criminal charges, mounds of documents have been seized and $6 million in cash has been confiscated.
16990	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed are some of the wealthiest and most powerful of the game's kingpins, as well as judges accused of issuing favorable rulings to keep the game running in return for payoffs, sometime as much as $15,000 a month.
16991	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Yet for all the talk of a crackdown, the game goes on.
16992	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	And to Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship between those who control the game and those who make and enforce the laws.
16993	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the 1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
16995	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.
16996	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Players can bet on any combination of two-, three- or four-digit numbers, the last two digits of which are associated with any one of 25 animals, ranging from the alligator to the turkey.
16997	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The biggest payoff, $4,000 for a one-dollar bet, is awarded to those who "hit the thousand," or correctly pick a winning four-digit number.
16998	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"If I dream of a rooster, well then of course I'll bet on a rooster," said Silvio Cunha, who works as a doorman at an apartment building here.
16999	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"When my mother comes to visit, I bet on her flight number, and when I get my telephone bill I bet on that number too.
17000	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	You need always to be alert to numbers that can bring you luck."
17001	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The animal game was created in the 1890s by the owner of a zoo here as a way to promote his venture.
17002	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	It became almost instantly popular, which soon led the government, fearing that money would be drained away from official lotteries, to ban it.
17003	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	For decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent campaigns to snuff it out.
17004	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Finally, in 1946, the government outlawed casinos and games of chance, the animal game among them.
17005	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless it survives.
17006	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Today it is played everywhere in Brazil, including remote corners of the Amazon, but continues to be controlled from Rio by about a dozen bosses, called bicheiros.
17007	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Winning numbers are picked twice daily at a downtown building that serves as the syndicate headquarters.
17008	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The results are immediately sent to the thousands of betting points across the country.
17011	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Numerous sambas have been written about the game.
17012	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In one of the most famous, "I Hit the Thousand," a lucky bettor exults at fulfilling the poor man's dream: "I won 500 smackers, and now I'm not going to work anymore."
17013	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Though many Brazilians are reluctant to acknowledge it, bicheiros also play a central, even essential, role in Carnival here.
17014	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Not only do they contribute the money that allows the samba "schools" to parade with elaborate floats and costumes, but they sometimes act as their "honorary presidents."
17015	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	This year and last, directors of samba schools were killed shortly before Carnival in what the authorities described as murders related to disputes about control of the animal game.
17018	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But at a court hearing in April he said that he was active in the animal game only between 1982 and 1993 and that he made his living now as a "financial consultant," earning commissions of as much as $200,000 a month from clients investing in the stock market.
17019	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He's the one who brought an organizational sense and structure to the game," said Frossard, the former judge, who has been the target of assassination attempts that she attributes to hired guns in the pay of game kingpins.
17020	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He also encouraged the group to try to capture the state, at all three levels of government and all three branches, instead of just paying off the police."
17021	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known here as "nickel hunters."
17022	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the leftist Workers' Party.
17024	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	At one point a tape was played in which a party fundraiser could be heard urging the chief of police to go easy on numbers runners.
17026	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In return, the bicheiro promised to contribute more than $100,000 to the Workers' Party campaign and to pay a 1 percent commission to the official, who had to resign as a result.
17027	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Shortly afterward, da Silva, who had originally favored legalizing the animal game, issued a temporary decree outlawing bingo parlors.
17028	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But the Senate refused to make the measure permanent.
17029	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Bicheiros and their associates have obtained judicial rulings, many of them issued by judges later arrested, that have blunted the effect of the prohibition.
17030	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Da Silva's chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, has now indicated that the government is considering an about-face and is at least willing to study the possibility of legalizing the animal game.
17031	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"It's not a simple question," she said recently, but "it's obvious that as the investigations deepen, an institutional model for the question of games of chance is going to be delineated in Brazil."
17032	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Some Brazilians oppose legalization on moral grounds or because they fear that it would attract foreign crime organizations.
17033	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Others are simply skeptical.
17034	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"I'd wager that legalization is never going to happen," Luiz Carlos Menezes de Sa, a waiter, predicted after placing a 50-cent bet on 3568, a number associated with the monkey.
17035	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Without their bribes from the bicheiros, the politicians, cops and judges wouldn't be able to live high on the hog the way they do," he said.
17036	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"Why would they want to do away with something that makes so much money for them?"

17335	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists in the Netherlands have uncovered what they believe is part of the military road that marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire from the middle of the first century A.D.
17336	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Train company Prorail made the initial discovery during preparations to add extra rail lines in the city of Houten, 10 kilometers (6 miles) southeast of Utrecht.
17338	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists and Prorail will complete an excavation of a short stretch in the coming weeks, and carry out exploratory digs to determine the further route of the road, the city said in a statement.
17339	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Excavations of parts of the road, known as the "limes," are ongoing in other European countries and the U.N. is considering declaring it a world heritage site.
17341	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Although the limes' course is known from ancient maps, archaeologists have been unable to locate it south of Utrecht and the stretch found in Houten is believed to have connected two forts: Fectio, modern Vechten, and Traiectum, modern Utrecht.
17342	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Romans first entered this part of the Netherlands under Julius Caesar in the year 53 B.C.
17344	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Archaeologists have yet to determine a date for the road, which the city said is built on a sloping mound of sand and clay, interspersed with layers of gravel.
17345	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	It was flanked by drainage channels and has wooden poles for reinforcement.
17346	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Pottery shards were used as filler material in several places, which should aid in dating.
17347	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	The discovery is the latest of several in the area of Utrecht.
17348	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	In 2002, archaeologists found the remains of a watchtower on the Rhine where detachments of three or four soldiers would have served as lookouts.
17349	APW_ENG_20070105.0655.LDC2009T13	Near the tower, they found bones and other remains of food the soldiers ate and such objects as a spearpoint, a coin, an ax, a sickle and an ancient pen.

17364	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Begun in 2003 before lapsing for three years, the six-country disarmament negotiations resumed after North Korea staged its first nuclear test in 2006, finally producing a landmark denuclearisation agreement in February 2007.
17365	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The negotiations then hit a deadlock at the end of last year when North Korea failed to meet a deadline to fully disable its weapons-grade plutonium plants and deliver a full accounting of its nuclear activities, including a suspected uranium enrichment program.
17366	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The deadlock was broken last month when North Korea handed over a partial accounting or "declaration" of its plutonium-related programmes that must now be completely dismantled and the whole process verified.
17368	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	Rice said that required a minimum of 45 days notification, the same period Washington has given North Korea to agree on the verification protocol.
17369	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"I think it should be very well understood that unless we're satisfied that we can verify the declaration, we have been very clear that we're taking that into our assessment of when to go forward," Rice said.
17371	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	But she said there are "internationally recognised methods to verify the number of kilograms of plutonium made."
17372	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	The protocol will "have to have specific measures, it will have to have means for access, and it will also have to have means to continue this process as new information becomes available," Rice said.
17373	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	"This will be a strong protocol.
17374	AFP_ENG_20080724.0711.LDC2009T13	All the parties yesterday talked about a rigorous protocol, talked about one that is to international standards."

17409	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Blackburn Rovers manager Paul Ince's future hung on a thread on Saturday after his side side suffered a sixth successive Premiership defeat 3-0 to Wigan Athletic managed by former Manchester United team-mate Steve Bruce.
17410	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Defeat means that Blackburn - champions in 1996 - are second from bottom of the table and in danger of being relegated for the second time in their Premiership history, haivng been relegated under former Manchester United assistant manager Brian Kidd.
17415	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	However, Wigan went desperately close to making it 3-0 in the 57th minute as leading scorer Amr Zaki unleashed a shot from close on the goal but it went wide.
17416	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Dunn took time to get going after a long lay-off with an Achilles tendon injury but finally produced a shot worthy of Chris Kirkland making a save in the 66th minute.
17417	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	It was Wigan, though, who deservedly extended their lead in the 77th minute as Cattermole drove home from just inside the area following anothe rgood piece of work by the seemingly tireless Valencia.
17418	AFP_ENG_20081213.0150.LDC2009T13	Rovers did at the least have the final shot on target with Roque Santa Cruz forcing the excellent Kirkland into a fine save.

17425	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	But critics charge that the opposition has been marginalised by biased media coverage and the use of state resources to promote the Kremlin's candidate.
17426	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	A few strains showed through on Wednesday's tour, as when two workmen admitted to nervousness while "painting" and "repainting" a ceiling.

17433	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Moscow has been working for some time on ensuring a seamless transition after eight years under Putin, who is however expected to retain power in a job as prime minister.
17434	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev currently holds the post of first deputy prime minister, in which he has been responsible for the touchstone issues of housing, health and education.
17435	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Since Putin named Medvedev as his preferred successor last month, Medvedev's tours around the country to inspect such projects and meet residents have stepped up.
17437	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev occasionally encounters complaints, such as when a building site worker told him of his worries about the cost of education and housing.
17438	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	Medvedev responded that the state would maintain the current number of subsidised higher education places and urged the young man to work hard.
17439	AFP_ENG_20080117.0307.LDC2009T13	At a meeting with regional governors he went on to emulate Putin's habit of reeling off statistics, taking copious notes, making cutting interjections and at one point rebuking an enthusiastic governor.

17457	APW_ENG_20070805.0576.LDC2009T13	That works out to just 83 shekels -- or $20 -- a month for each survivor, a sum critics deemed woefully inadequate.

17488	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	A Sept. 25, 2001, Justice Department memo declared that under the Constitution decisions regarding the "amount of military force to be used" in response to the terrorist threat, as well as "the method, timing and nature of the response," are "for the president alone to make."
17489	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."
17490	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
17492	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	He has issued a steady stream of signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority to limit coercive interrogation tactics.
17495	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe.
17498	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
17501	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	That conservative backlash gained ground during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, and it was articulated in 1987 in the minority report of the Iran-contra committee.
17504	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	As Schwarz and Huq see it, the Bush White House's "broader efforts to seize unfettered control of national security policy and to eliminate the checks and balances imposed by Congress and the courts" is exemplified by its post 9/11 decision "to ignore legal constraints on torture."
17506	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately narrow definition of torture.
17507	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	One 2002 memo defined it as causing the sort of "intense pain or suffering" ordinarily associated "with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result."
17509	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	For instance the authors observe that a presidential finding signed days after 9/11 gave the CIA sweeping new powers to disrupt terrorist activity and permission to kill, capture and detain members of Al Qaida anywhere in the world: powers, in the view of some intelligence officers, that included the implicit authority to create black sites (secret detention facilities outside the United States, where terrorism suspects could be held beyond the Bush's signing of a 2002 presidential order authorizing NSA surveillance in the homeland without a court- approved warrant, an order that effectively circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed by Congress in 1978.
17510	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Although briefings were provided to a handful of congressional leaders, Schwarz and Huq report, those leaders were prohibited from saying anything about them to anyone, including other intelligence committee members, a stipulation that "gutted the possibility of effective oversight."
17512	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Indeed, the abiding genius of the Founding Generation was its rejection of the idea that unchecked unilateral power is ever properly vested in any one branch of government.
17513	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Our government was framed 'to control itself,' as James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers.
17514	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	'Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'
17515	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Dividing powers between three branches, the Founders harnessed human passions in the cause of limited government.
17516	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Madison, again writing in the Federalist Papers, provided the enduring explanation for this division of government: 'The accumulation of all power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny."'

17528	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	The Super Bowl beast gets bigger every year.
17529	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Sure, when the game came to Tampa in 2001, it brought along an impressive menu of party options and a constellation of Hollywood faces for stargazers.
17530	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	But when it returns in 2009, expect an avalanche of both driven in part by new media options, ranging from the NFL Network to original programming for mobile devices, and more public events hosted by the NFL.
17532	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"This is so different from before," he said.
17533	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"Massively."
17534	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year, the traditional Nike, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Maxim and Playboy parties were on tap, with access limited to VIPs and those with plenty of disposable income.
17535	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	But John Travolta, Sean "Diddy" Combs, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg to name a few also lent their names to events, some with tickets available for as little as $15, and others going for more than $1,000.
17536	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Common folk could buy tickets to the Pepsi Smash Super Bowl concert series, which is broadcast on VH1.
17537	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Last year, before the Super Bowl in Miami, the concerts featured Fergie and John Legend.
17538	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year it was Mary J. Blige and Maroon 5, with tickets available for less than $50.
17539	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the NFL this year hosted Super Bowl Saturday Night, which includes a free concert by the Counting Crows and a fireworks show.
17540	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Krista Soroka, director of events and hospitality for the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee, said she spoke to the NFL about possible locations for a similar event in the bay area next year.
17541	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Locals welcome
17542	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	"The NFL is trying to create more opportunities for the locals to be involved," she said.
17543	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Soroka is part of a Tampa Bay contingent that fanned out across Phoenix, Glendale and surrounding areas this week to get a taste of what to expect next year.
17544	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	The group hosted a party Thursday night that had some star power of its own.
17547	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	In 2001, about 3,500 media-types received credentials to cover Super Bowl activities in Tampa.
17548	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	This year, a record 4,786 credentials were issued to U.S. and international media from print, television, radio and Internet outlets.
17549	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	When Tampa last hosted a Super Bowl, ESPN radio broadcast from a corner of the Marriott Waterside Hotel with a staff of 16 people.

17554	NYT_ENG_20080203.0075.LDC2009T13	Sprint set up stages in Phoenix and Scottsdale, from where it sent celebrity and athlete interviews with the likes of 50 Cent, Paris Hilton, Jerry Rice and Barry Sanders directly to Sprint subscribers.

17641	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Nearly 70 years after his death, Freud's spiritual heirs are still turning out learned papers with great enthusiasm, attempting to shed light into the dark recesses of the human mind.
17642	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	Providing a perfect forum for them is "The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child," an annual started in 1945 by Anna Freud, the icon's psychoanalyst daughter, and her colleagues.
17643	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The title seems to suggest that it only pertains to children, but actually, it brims with articles of great human interest and originality on topics that range from infancy to grandfatherhood, from the origins of aggression to the mysteries of human resilience.
17644	APW_ENG_20070727.0111.LDC2009T13	The volume is divided into five categories: Clinical Contributions

17690	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Movie review: Twisted revenge tale `Teeth ' will leave you laughing and squirming
17692	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	The name "Teeth" may ring a bell with you.
17693	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's a film that had audiences laughing and squirming simultaneously last year at Sundance, where it earned an acting prize for its fresh-faced, fearless star, Jess Weixler.
17694	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth.
17695	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Yes, she is a living example of the vagina dentata myth, a concept that actor Mitchell Lichtenstein explores in writing and directing his feature debut.
17696	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Lichtenstein's movie is a darkly funny homage to 1950's sci-fi B-flicks (the nuclear plant cooling towers looming behind the girl's nondescript tract house, which may have caused her deformation, are an amusing touch) but it's also a female revenge tale.
17697	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	It's an interesting mix that eventually goes haywire toward the end, when Lichtenstein seems intent on one-upping the gross- out factor he'd established early on.
17698	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(You do see severed, um, parts.)
17700	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	She's part of an organization known as The Promise, and gives out red plastic rings for kids to wear as a reminder of their chastity.
17701	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Even kissing is a no-no.
17702	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But Lichtenstein never makes fun of her, and Weixler, whose wholesome blond looks are reminiscent of a younger Heather Graham, treats the character with just as much respect.
17703	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Dawn may be fiercely protective of her innocence in reaction to an event that took place when she was a very young girl, something she doesn't even remember but we see at the film's start.
17704	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Her new stepbrother, Brad, tries to mess around with her while the two are in a kiddie wading pool and gets "bitten"
17705	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	years later, grown-up Brad (John Hensley from "Nip/Tuck"), is tatted, pierced, perpetually stoned and hates women.
17706	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But he still wants to do it with Dawn, and the fact that she's so fearful of her budding sexuality only makes her more desirable.
17707	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Being a teenager, though, her curiosity eventually takes over and she allows herself to become interested in a boy in the abstinence group, the slightly goofy Tobey (Hale Appleman).
17708	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But when he tries to go too far with her while swimming at the lake one afternoon, he learns too late that no really does mean no.
17709	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	A visit to the gynecologist to find out what's wrong with her also has disastrous consequences.
17710	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(It's the film's funniest scene, mainly because we all know what's coming and the arrogant doctor doesn't).
17711	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Eventually, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew (sorry, couldn't resist) as Dawn feels increasingly comfortable in her own skin and begins seducing men who deserve their comeuppance.
17712	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	(Its climactic moment, if you will, is way too over the top.)
17713	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	And a subplot involving her dying mother seems out of place in contrast with the comedy.
17714	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But it's easy to imagine "Teeth" gaining a cult following through midnight showings
17715	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	it's the kind of movie you want to watch with friends, to laugh and scream and not have to think too hard, and then who knows?
17716	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	Maybe go home and get lucky afterward.

17727	XIN_ENG_20070503.0071.LDC2009T13	This, according to the CBS, was mainly attributed to a fall in prices of tomatoes, kales, maize flour, sugar and maize grain.

17756	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	The criminal investigation of New York's former police commissioner is on track to crash headlong into the Republican presidential race -- and Rudy Giuliani's final push for the nomination.
17759	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Ethics questions and corruption allegations also have swirled around Kerik.
17760	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president," Giuliani says often, adding that he should have more thoroughly vetted his associate of nearly two decades.
17761	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Such acknowledgments may not be enough for Giuliani to emerge politically unscathed as prosecutors wrap up their investigation of Kerik on multiple federal felony charges.
17762	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Kerik is expected to confront the results of the investigation as early as next month -- and it is widely believed he will either be indicted or reach a plea agreement with prosecutors.
17763	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should prosecutors charge Kerik and the case reach trial, Giuliani could end up being called to testify during the general election campaign.
17764	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Should Kerik agree to a plea deal, he could be admitting guilt on some level for activities that may have taken place while the city employed him -- and on Giuliani's watch.
17765	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	At the very least, the case will be in the headlines again, especially if soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Michael Mukasey, another Giuliani friend, recuses himself from any Justice Department prosecution of Kerik.
17766	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani aides play down any political implications, but they acknowledge that Kerik's woes could be a distraction during a period in which they want their candidate promoting his vision for the United States.
17767	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"It will matter significantly if his opponents bring it up," said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political science professor.
17768	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"And, they very well might, especially if he's the front-runner."
17769	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	If Giuliani wins the nomination, Shapiro said, "the Democrats will make this an issue.
17770	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	You can count on that."
17771	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	So far, Kerik's troubles have not seemed to nick Giuliani's primary campaign narrative that he is a Republican who tamed a Democratic city and heroically led New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
17772	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani leads other Republicans in national polls and is competing strongly in early presidential preference voting states.
17773	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Rivals have stepped up criticism of him lately, and Kerik's case would give them more fodder.
17774	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Opponents Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John McCain or Mike Huckabee could use Kerik to try to define Giuliani as somebody who lacks good judgment and surrounds himself with unsavory people.
17775	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	"This speaks to issues of ethics and corruption.
17776	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	It speaks to capability and leadership," Shapiro said.

17827	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	This is largely because vintners wait longer to pick their grapes.
17828	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	More mature fruit is thought to make tastier wine, but it also means sugar levels have a chance to rise, which comes with the side effect of pumping up the alcohol volume.
17829	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Warmer harvests only increase the phenomenon.
17830	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
17831	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
17833	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Still, big reds, many of which are highly rated by critics, have their champions.
17834	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"They fill your mouth with flavor
17835	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	you can chew on them.
17836	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	They linger on your palate when you're drinking them and that's what Napa is known for -- its big, chewy cabs," said Doug White, director of operations for the Vintner's Collective, a Napa tasting room specializing in boutique wineries.
17837	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	For those who don't like the big wines, some have an issue with the style of higher-alcohol vintages while others are wary of the punch they can pack.
17838	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One definition of the "right" alcohol level is if two people can finish a bottle and "wish there was a little bit more," said Dunn.
17839	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.
17840	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You'd be lying on the floor."
17841	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	It's not always easy to tell just how much alcohol is in a wine.
17842	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
17844	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
17845	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
17846	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One way to have ripe fruit without high alcohol is to use various technologies available to pull alcohol out of wine.
17848	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The truth is that wine has already been affected by technology, from stainless steel tanks to sterile filtration, he said.
17849	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Unlike cooking, where chefs proudly show off new techniques made possible through innovation, winemaking's become more secretive, said Smith.
17850	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"It's a shame," he said, "because winemaking's just cooking."
17851	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Vinovation's process works by using powerful filters that remove alcohol and water from wine.
17852	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
17853	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
17854	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
17855	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that wineries don't want to be criticized by the wine press and others who harken back to wonderful wines they've had around the world that were just made with the hands of the winemaker and input from the grower," he said.
17857	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"We like our wines.
17858	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the fruit.
17859	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	We like the richness," he said.
17860	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Shafer is aware of the debate over how much is too much, but says it's up to consumers to decide what style of wine they prefer.
17861	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling everything," he points out.
17862	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Industry wide, "the quality of wines from around the world just keep getting better and better," Shafer said.
17863	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think this is the golden age for the consumer."

17868	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Long-shot Huckabee determined to fight to the end
17869	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Mike Huckabee may still be a long shot in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, but his weekend victories in Kansas and Louisiana proved he is likely to be a thorn in the side of frontrunner John McCain for some time to come.
17870	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Despite McCain's solid lead in the battle for delegates to the Republican nominating convention, which analysts call nearly impossible to overcome, Huckabee insisted Sunday he was going to fight all the way to the wire.
17871	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it needs unity against the powerful Democrats.
17873	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"This country was built on the impossible.
17874	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And it's impossible that I'm still in the race.
17875	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That's what most people would have said a few months ago."
17877	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	In Louisiana, Huckabee squeaked out a narrow win, 43 percent to 42 percent.
17878	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he narrowly lost the Washington state caucus, which voted 26 percent for McCain, 24 percent for Huckabee.
17879	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He said Sunday however that he would launch a challenge to the Washington State caucus results, complaining that far too few of votes were counted when the election was called in McCain's favor.
17880	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	And he rejected calls for to pull out of the race.
17881	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"The fact they're blowing against me hardly motivates me to quit," he told reporters in Washington.
17882	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"It motivates me to play harder.
17883	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	If they think they're getting a chorus of voices that will make me say okay, it's time to leave, they don't know me very well."
17885	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But he refused to concede any inevitability Sunday.
17886	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm prepared to stay in until somebody has 1,191 delegates because that's the magic number at which a person is the nominee of the party," Huckabee insisted on CBS.
17888	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"So are we to tell them, 'Forget your vote
17889	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	we don't even care what you think?"
17890	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Huckabee's success has come on the back of the party's conservatives, who have made well-known their disgust with McCain, branding him a "closet liberal."
17893	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	McCain's views on immigration "were way out of the mainstream and quite unorthodox.
17894	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	He has been often the voice in the wilderness," he added.
17896	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I've actually run a government," he told CBS.
17897	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"I think senators have the luxury of taking several issues, maybe two or three, and they can specialize in them."
17899	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	Analysts say Huckabee's refusal to pull out of the race -- as did Mitt Romney on Thursday -- could deepen the party division between conservatives and Republicans ready to back McCain because he stands the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee in November.
17900	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	But the conservatives are also said to hope their resistance to McCain could push him to adopt more of their positions, like an absolute opposition to abortion and a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
17901	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	One widely-reported scenario has Huckabee accepting to be McCain's vice presidential running mate in the election.
17904	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	I'm not sure I would select him," he said.
17905	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	"There are no discussions for such a thing because, at this point, I'm still running for president.
17906	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	There's no other reason for me to think otherwise."

17909	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The National Teachers' Association said Monday that teachers can make unruly students stand so that "they can reflect upon their wrongs."
17910	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The association issued the clarification after the Apple Daily, a local tabloid, reported that the Ministry of Education will soon publish guidelines for teachers counselling or disciplining students.
17911	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	One claim by the paper was that teachers, when disciplining students, would need their consent.
17912	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The teachers will also not be able to demand students to do pushups or frog jumps if the purpose is to punish the students, according to the reports.
17913	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Yang Yi-feng, an association official, said that in the future, there will be no such thing as a "disciplinary stand" and that the teachers will only require students "stand to reflect upon themselves."
17914	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	Since the purpose is for the students to reflect upon themselves, the teachers will not need to obtain the students' consent, he added.
17915	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The Legislative Yuan approved a total ban on corporal punishment last December.
17917	CNA_ENG_20070423.0016.LDC2009T13	The association said that after discussions over the last four months, it has mapped out details of the guidelines.

17919	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	ROME, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
17920	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The unusually warm winter has left little snow on the ground for the upcoming World Winter University Games, but organizers said Monday the events will be held without any great problems.
17921	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	The situation was almost the opposite last year when the same slopes hosted the Winter Olympic Games in near perfect conditions.
17922	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	At present the only slope with insufficient snow is the one used for the snowboarding events but organizers said that they expected to resolve this in time.
17924	XIN_ENG_20070108.0337.LDC2009T13	A total of 11 sports will be represented at the games: the biathlon, Nordic combined, curling, ice hockey, figure skating, ski jumping, Alpine and cross country skiing, long and short track speed skating and snowboarding.
17931	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	But the political opposition has been pressing for more details.
17933	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	One major mass daily newspaper reported Friday that Yar'Adua may have undergone a kidney transplant.
17935	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	He also flew unannounced from the country in mid-2007, disappearing to Germany for days, just before April 2007 elections that he won.
17936	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Election observers condemned the vote as rigged and unrepresentative of the public will.
17937	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	The government has insisted during Yar'Adua's trip to Saudi Arabia that he has been able to fulfill his presidential duties -- apparently trying to forestall challenges to his authority.
17940	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Yar'Adua's predecessor was a southerner, as is Jonathan, Yar'Adua's deputy.
17941	APW_ENG_20080906.0325.LDC2009T13	Many fear that power passing again so soon to a southerner would raise fierce opposition from northerners, and potentially undermine the country's fragile political consensus.
17942	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	World Cup organizers downplay safety concerns after soccer official attacked
17947	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Danny Jordaan, the CEO of the organizing committee, said crime in South Africa was a concern, but sports events in the country had been relatively incident-free.
17948	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	"The issue of societal crime is a matter the country must address but South Africa is not unique and when it comes to crime at sports events, South Africa has a track record equal to any other country," Jordaan said.
17950	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Khoza also said construction on the five new stadiums was underway while work on the five existing venues was on track to start in the second quarter of the year.
17951	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	This comes as a fresh bid to stop the construction of the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town was launched in court.
17952	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	The Cape Town Environmental Protection Association filed papers in the High Court requesting an urgent injunction to halt the 2.9 billion rand (US$392.4 million
17953	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	euro294 million) stadium, SAPA reported.
17954	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	Work on the stadium, which will host one of the World Cup semifinals, finally got underway on March 20.
17957	APW_ENG_20070403.1031.LDC2009T13	"But construction and related work continues and has not been affected," Makgabo said.
17962	APW_ENG_20070212.1205.LDC2009T13	The guards returned fire, seized the vehicle and detained the two men, the statement said.

17965	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Global Food Crisis: A Return to Wheat?
17966	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat is still a matter of debate.
17967	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The ethanol boom, in particular, is providing strong incentives to keep former wheat acres in corn.
17968	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Within a year, David Braaten, a farmer in Kindred, N.D., will be able to truck his corn to three modern ethanol refineries, one already built and two others near completion.
17969	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These huge distilleries will need corn from an area about the size of Rhode Island, and many of the acres will come at the expense of such traditional crops as wheat and sugar beets.
17970	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and oats.
17971	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed, a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of Bismarck, the capital.
17974	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	But wheat's biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned many farmers against it.
17976	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.
17977	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	These seeds are protected by patents and licensing agreements, requiring farmers to buy a new batch each year.
17978	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
17979	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Research might solve many of wheat's problems, but commercial companies say the opportunities for profit are limited.
17980	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
17981	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
17982	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is an expensive and time-consuming process.
17983	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed year after year.
17984	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
17985	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Unlike hybrid corn, which loses its productivity after the first year, seeds from improved wheat varieties can be saved and replanted for several years without significant loss of yield.
17987	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.
17989	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"It's a joy to make a difference in the life of the growers," said Mergoum, who worked earlier in the international program that developed higher-yielding "green revolution" wheats.
17990	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Glenn has proved resistant to scab, but it hasn't achieved universal acceptance among farmers.
17991	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Don Strickler, a farmer in Euclid, Minn., gave it a try one year but stopped using it after finding that a lot of the kernels cracked when they were separated from the chaff during threshing.
17992	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	As he sees it, Glenn is another example of how devilishly difficult it is to develop positive new traits in wheat without other problems arising.
17993	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	James A. Anderson, a plant breeder at the University of Minnesota, predicted that the seed companies will continue to make inroads in wheat country with new kinds of corn and soybeans.
17994	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They've definitely moved into the spring-wheat region with dedicated breeding," he said.
17995	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	"They're trying to get whatever acreage they can and sell more of their seed."

18002	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The breakthrough will not only settle the vexatious lager vs. stout debate, it will also help the quest to pour a perfect pint every time.
18003	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	Beer foam is a microstructure with complex interfaces.
18004	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	In other words: a cellular structure comprising networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid.
18005	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The walls of these bubbles move as a result of surface tension -- and the speed at which they move is related to the curvature of the bubbles.
18006	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	As a result of this movement, the bubbles merge and the structure "coarsens," meaning that the foam settles and eventually disappears.
18008	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	They build on work by a computer pioneer, John von Neumann, who in 1952 devised an equation in two dimensions.
18009	AFP_ENG_20070425.0365.LDC2009T13	The mathematics of beer-bubble behaviour are similar to the granular structure in metals and ceramics, so the equation also has an outlet in metallurgy and manufacturing as well as in pubs.

18011	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	EL SEGUNDO, Calif.
18012	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The expected return of Lamar Odom to the Lakers' starting lineup Friday will send one of his teammates to the bench, and the smart money seems to be on forward Luke Walton.
18013	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Barring any last-minute setbacks, Odom, who underwent shoulder surgery in May, will play Friday.
18014	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Last season, Odom partnered with Walton in the starting frontcourt, but that could change now.
18015	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I know, but you don't," coach Phil Jackson said after practice Wednesday afternoon.
18016	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	In response to separate questions, however, Jackson said Walton would "be really good to help that second team, too" and praised the effort of Ronny Turiaf, who has started each of the first four games.
18017	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"There's some things Ronny is doing that are very good," Jackson said.
18018	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"His energy is good.
18019	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Sustaining it is not easy for him.
18020	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It's a lot of work, and he's not in the kind of condition yet that he can sustain that, so it's great to have Lamar coming back, who can come in and play a couple different positions."
18021	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson did indicate that Odom would start, rather than ease his way back into the lineup as a reserve.
18022	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Walton, a reserve in his first three seasons, started all 60 games in which he appeared last season.
18023	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom, who led the Lakers in rebounding last season and was second in points and assists per game, went though his most physical practice to date and pronounced himself ready to return to game action.
18024	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Odom said he didn't fear that the shoulder would impact him physically and wasn't concerned that he would think about it while on the court.
18025	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I go all out," Odom said.
18026	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's how I play.
18028	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Just go out there.
18029	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	We're athletes, so we have to play in pain sometimes.
18030	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	It took me some time to come back from this injury but I feel like I'm ready."
18031	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	WALKING WOUNDED: Kwame Brown (right-heel bursitis) and Maurice Evans (lower-back pain) did not practice.
18032	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Evans is unlikely to play Friday and Brown's status remains day to day, Jackson said.
18033	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Brown received electronic-stimulation treatment near the end of practice, then hobbled off the court.
18034	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	DECISION TIME FOR JACKSON: Still uncertain is whether Jackson will return beyond this season.
18035	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	The Lakers have a standing contract extension on the table, and Jackson said he will make his decision soon.
18036	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"It will probably be before Thanksgiving, or around Thanksgiving time," Jackson said.
18037	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"That's a good time period."
18038	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson has maintained that health, along with the Lakers' chances of being a championship contender, will determine his future.
18039	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson periodically uses a cane to walk, five-plus months after his second hip-replacement surgery.
18040	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	Jackson said "things are going very positive for me" but said he wants to see how he feels after a longer road trip before he makes a decision.
18041	NYT_ENG_20071108.0033.LDC2009T13	"I've yet to experience a two-game road trip, or something like that, to just know that I can get out of bed, get my clothes on and make it to breakfast in the morning," Jackson said.
18042	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	JUSTICES MAKE IT TOUGHER TO SUE OVER FDA-APPROVED DEVICES
18043	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
18044	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the manufacturer of a federally approved medical device cannot be sued under state law if the device causes an injury.
18045	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	By 8-1, the court ruled in favor of Medtronic, the Minneapolis-based maker of a balloon catheter that burst and severely injured Charles R. Riegel while he was undergoing an angioplasty in 1996.
18046	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Riegel and his wife, Donna, sued the company in federal court, contending that the catheter had been designed, labeled and manufactured in a way that violated state law, and that those defects had caused severe and permanent injuries to Riegel.
18047	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But a federal district court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, dismissed the Riegels' suit on the ground that the catheter had been given pre-market approval by the Food and Drug Administration, thus protecting the manufacturer from liability under state law.
18048	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal courts on Wednesday, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority that Medtronic and other manufacturers were protected under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which in its section on pre- emption bars states from imposing on medical devices "any requirement which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter."
18049	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	But the justices' ruling was hardly the last word on when FDA approval bars patients from suing.
18050	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	They are already considering at least three cases involving drugs and drug-labeling.
18051	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Scalia wrote that the FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each device application and grants pre-market approval only if it finds there is a "reasonable assurance" of its "safety and effectiveness."
18052	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives," Scalia wrote, noting that the FDA approved a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts "even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent."
18054	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Arguing that "nothing is perfectly safe," Olson argued that it would harm patients and future patients to "discourage the marketing of products that might save our lives."
18055	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Medtronic, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cardiovascular devices, no longer makes the type of catheter used on Riegel, who died several years after the operation.
18056	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter on Wednesday, asserting that the majority had adopted an unnecessary "constriction of state authority."
18057	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	Ginsburg said she did not believe that Congress had intended to bring about "a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices."
18058	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	In this case, the Bush administration had taken the side of the medical-device industry, arguing argued that there would be "serious undermining of FDA's approval authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits" if juries could second-guess the agency.
18060	NYT_ENG_20080220.0046.LDC2009T13	"Pretty bad for patients, pretty good for industry profits," she said.

18070	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
18071	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea transplant.
18072	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
18073	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.
18074	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	This isn't terribly different from the far lazier "Over Her Dead Body," a romantic comedy about a psychic and a dead woman that also opened yesterday.
18075	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	(Unlike "The Eye," it was actually screened for movie critics.)
18076	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The original "Eye" was a moody mediocre stab at supernatural dread from Danny and Oxide Pang, Thai-born twins working out of Hong Kong.
18077	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Slow, vague, and without a legitimate chill or a surprise, the movie was a drag.
18079	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	.
18080	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
18081	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But we've been here before, no?
18082	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Moreau and Palud's first film together was an ultimately underwhelming exercise in terror called "Them."
18083	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's a notch above this, their Hollywood debut.
18084	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	The noise and cheap bumps in the night from the Pangs' movie have been toned down, but without them you realize that atmosphere was all the Pangs had going for them.
18085	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Now "The Eye" is a pilot for another show about a sexy woman who sees - or is obsessed with - the dead.
18086	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But Alba, with her ethereal beauty, is no Patricia Arquette ("Medium") or Jill Hennessy ("Crossing Jordan").
18087	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.
18088	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But even Hewitt's face has a range of feeling.
18089	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Her voice has pleasingly rich character.
18090	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"
18091	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She narrates "The Eye."
18092	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	And it speaks volumes about her directors' tone deafness that they play up what will never be Alba's strong suit.
18093	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	"People say seeing is believing... Now I see using my other senses... I bet music looks beautiful."
18094	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	All I can see is jeans.
18095	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alba spends a lot of her scenes with Parker Posey, who plays Sydney's guilty sister
18096	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Alessandro Nivola, who plays her sight therapist
18097	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
18099	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.
18100	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But they are here enough for you to appreciate the experience in their faces versus the disruptive purity in their costar's.
18101	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
18102	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	One thing going for her is the uncommon, unblemished niceness she radiates on screen.
18103	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It's terrible for horror or action or comedy or drama.
18104	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But it's perfect for, say, water.
18105	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She was never more convincing than she was as Paul Walker's moral- minded girlfriend in the tropical thriller "Into the Blue."
18106	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.
18107	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	If she's going to keep doing fright movies, maybe she can be the Esther Williams of horror.

18112	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The plastic explosives were smuggled in bottles of White Rain and Prell shampoo, and in the soles of a pair of black leather boots.
18113	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Fixed to Casio digital clocks and 9-volt batteries with black adhesive tape, they became powerful bombs.
18116	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	A secret grand jury is meeting in Newark to decide whether to indict Posada on charges of financing a terrorist operation.
18117	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	FBI agents visited Havana last year in connection with the probe, following up on a 1998 trip to the island, according to two U.S. law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.
18119	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Visiting FBI agents deposed him during the 1998 trip, and while he said he had no information on more recent visits, he said U.S. prosecutors should have what they need.
18122	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was acquitted in the plane bombing in Venezuela, then escaped from prison while awaiting a retrial.
18123	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was detained in March 2005 on charges of lying to U.S. immigration officials, and was awaiting trial in Texas until a U.S. district judge dropped the charges Tuesday, accusing the U.S. government of "fraud, deceit and trickery" while trying to buy time for its criminal investigation.
18125	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Cuba has called the U.S. government hypocritical for arresting alleged terrorists around the world -- and sending some to a naval base in eastern Cuba -- while letting Posada go free.
18126	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The prosecution never charged him for being what he is -- a terrorist," the Communist Party newspaper Granma declared.
18127	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But lawyers say there's a good chance that Posada will wind up being tried in New Jersey.
18128	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The (U.S.) government is working very hard on this.
18129	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	They are pushing forward on this," said Gilberto M. Garcia, the attorney for five New Jersey Cuban-Americans he described as potential witnesses.
18130	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. prosecutors, he said, are under tremendous pressure "to get him on something."
18131	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	By his own admission, Posada has dedicated his life to Castro's downfall.
18132	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He fled his native Cuba after the 1959 revolution and trained alongside other exiles for the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.
18133	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He went to Venezuela in 1967, became a citizen and worked in the country's intelligence services.
18135	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He was convicted of endangering public safety in connection with a plot to assassinate Castro at a summit, but was later pardoned.
18137	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Although Venezuela still seeks his extradition in the plane bombing, a U.S. judge ruled he could not be sent there or to Cuba for fear he could be tortured.
18138	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The New Jersey probe has the most potential to put Posada behind bars in the United States.
18139	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"Follow the Newark grand jury," advised Phil Peters of the Lexington Institute, a pro-democracy think tank near Washington.
18140	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"Only one issue remains: whether the U.S. government will treat Posada as a terrorist rather than merely an illegal immigrant," Peters wrote in his blog.
18141	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The immigration charges were always a sideshow."
18142	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. Justice Department officials won't discuss the secret proceedings.
18146	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Both were given the death penalty, but were later spared and remain in prison.

18189	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Birgit Prinz looks set to become the first player to appear in three Finals: in 1995 she played 42 minutes against Norway and was of course of crucial importance in the 2003 Final against Sweden.
18192	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	They break down into 46 World Cup goals (2.2 per match), 30 at the Under-20 level (1.7) and 27 in Olympic Football tournaments (1.7).

18196	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	This is the second time that two teams with the best goal record meet in the Final.
18197	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	In 1999, China (19 goals) met hosts USA (18) but subsequently neither of them managed to find the net in 120 minutes.
18198	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Germany could become the first team to win two consecutive titles in a FIFA women's competition: no World Cup winner or Olympic Gold medal winner has ever managed to defend the title.

18215	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"This law will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on our soil," Bush said as he signed the bill, calling it "vital to the security of our people."
18216	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad while respecting the liberties of Americans here at home," he said.
18217	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White House demand.
18218	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The bill had sparked fierce debate between civil liberties advocates who argue it eroded checks on the power of government and intelligence officials who feared the row was compromising their power to thwart terror attacks.
18219	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure, after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for telecom firms.
18220	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our midst," Bush said.
18221	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The attack changed our country forever.
18222	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	We realized America was a nation at war.
18223	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Against a ruthless and persistent enemy."
18224	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The president added: "The most important lessons learned after 9/11 was that America's intelligence professionals lack some of the tools they needed to monitor the communications of terrorists abroad.
18225	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"It's essential that our intelligence committee know who our enemies are talking to, what they're saying, and what they're planning."
18226	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	After the September 11 attacks, Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on calls and emails between the United States and abroad in cases that federal agents deemed may have a terror link.
18227	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The wiretaps went ahead without the permission of a special court set up to watch over government wiretapping operations inside the United States, provided for under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.
18229	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law says the FISA court mechanism is the only way the government can order electronic surveillance of terror suspects.
18230	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The 1978 law allowed the ultra-secretive National Security Agency to wiretap for 72 hours while waiting for the FISA court to approve the action.
18231	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows them to use any information they got even if the FISA court eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.
18232	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA investigating FedEx planes getting too close on takeoff from Memphis airport
18234	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Two FedEx jets got too close to each other on takeoff from the Memphis airport last week because of confusion over flight numbers for the planes, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said.
18235	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident, which the FAA classified as serious, air traffic control error, remained under investigation.
18236	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The air traffic controllers union blamed the incident and other recent mistakes by controllers at Memphis on short staffing and forced overtime.
18238	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"We have never found fatigue to be an issue in any of the errors that have occurred at Memphis," Bergen said.
18239	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	On Feb. 21, two FedEx jets flying in the same direction on takeoff came within 200 feet (60 meters) vertically and three- fourths of a mile (1.2 kilometers) horizontally to each other, Bergen said.
18240	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Big jets in the Memphis area are supposed to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) vertically and 3 miles (5 kilometers) horizontally.
18242	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
18243	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident began with the pilot of one plane getting on the wrong radio frequency "and accepting instructions intended for another aircraft," Bergen said.
18244	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.
18245	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	"The controller didn't recognize the error on read-back," Bergen said.
18246	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.
18248	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FedEx declined comment, noting the investigation was ongoing.
18249	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	European cancer cases rise 10 percent in two years
18250	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Diagnosed cases of cancer rose by 10 percent in Europe over two years, an increase attributable to the continent's ageing population, the effects of smoking and better screening for breast cancer, doctors reported on Wednesday.
18251	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	In 2006, there were 3.2 million new cases of cancer in 39 European countries, compared with 2.9 million in 2004, they said.
18252	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	For the first time, breast cancer overtook lung cancer as the commonest diagnosed cancer, with 429,000 new cases in 2006, or nearly one in seven of the total.
18253	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	It was followed by colorectal cancer, with 412,900 cases, and lung cancer, 386,300 cases.
18254	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Lung cancer, though, remains the biggest killer, accounting for 334,800 out of the 1.7 million cancer deaths in Europe in 2006.
18255	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	It was followed by colorectal cancer (207,400 deaths), breast cancer (131,900) and stomach cancer (118,200).
18256	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	The report was issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), based in Lyon, southeastern France.
18257	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco smoking," said IARC director Peter Boyle.
18258	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"Tobacco control is clearly a number one priority in Europe, not only aimed at men, particularly the male populations of Central and Eastern Europe, but increasingly targeted towards women, especially in Northern Europe."
18264	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	While publicly the opposition has not changed stance, its calls for Ishiba's head have cooled this week, which media reports attributed to a request from the victims' family.
18266	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"He has to take responsibility by clarifying what caused the accident and taking thorough preventive measures," he said, declining to be named.
18267	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Fukuda and Ishiba both visited the village, with the premier offering a tearful apology to Sachiko Kichisei, whose husband and son are both presumed dead.
18268	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	Fukuda received a letter from the family, which media reports said asked him to spare Ishiba.
18269	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	"I don't know what exactly the letter said, but I'm sure it was along the lines of the feelings that we all share," the fisherman said.

18275	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	In the next several weeks, the New York Stock Exchange plans to shut two trading rooms that were added decades ago, when its status as the place to buy and sell stocks was unchallenged, the New York Times reported Sunday on its website.
18276	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The exchange has been the hub of financial activity in Lower Manhattan for more than a century, but the buzz emanating from its famous trading floor is dying down as computerized trading has rapidly reduced the need for face-to-face transactions.
18277	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak.
18278	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The "crowd" -- the brokers and clerks on the floor -- has dwindled to about 1,700 from a high of more than 3,000, said the report.
18279	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Before the exchange became a public company in 2005, its members controlled 1,366 seats, or licenses to trade.
18280	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Now, about 800 brokers pay the annual 50,000-dollar fee for a license.
18281	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The exchange's neighborhood is transforming just as quickly.
18282	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Only a few major financial firms, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, still maintain headquarters on or near Wall Street.
18283	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The blocks nearby, once filled with investment houses, are now home to apartments and luxury goods stores like Tiffany and Hermes.
18284	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	The decline in activity at the exchange's headquarters at 11 Wall Street is palpable.
18285	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Tourists no longer queue up by the hundreds to survey the floor from the visitors' gallery or watch the ceremonial ringing of the opening and closing bells.
18287	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Inside the exchange, a once-vital organ has been reduced to a reliable backdrop for financial shows on cable.
18288	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Even on its busiest day, the trading floor is a sideshow compared with the center-ring attraction it was several years ago.
18289	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	Most of the action in shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange happens electronically, between the computers of traders at brokerage houses, mutual fund companies and home offices in spare bedrooms.
18290	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	City officials express hope that the executives who run the exchange will find a way to maintain its image as the gold standard of financial markets, but they are resigned to its diminished physical presence and the permanent loss of jobs on the floor, said the New York Times.

18333	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The study, published online this month in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, followed 140 patients or their primary caregivers at two hospitals in southeastern Michigan.
18334	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers asked patients to recall what their doctors told them about their diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency department care, and return instructions.
18335	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers then compared their responses with their actual charts, and asked whether the patients thought they had fully understood the instructions.
18336	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do when they left the hospital.
18338	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If there's one aspect of a patient's care and instructions that I would hope they'd leave the emergency department with, it's ... what they should be doing when they get home.
18339	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This means that those people are likely to have difficulty following the directions," Engel said.
18341	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
18342	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do when they get home.
18343	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.
18344	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five - of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem," she said.
18345	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"They won't even say ((their comprehension is)) only very good - they'll say it's excellent."
18347	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said.
18349	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The fact that patients were given handwritten discharge notes, instead of the printed, bullet-point style fact sheets that have become standard, he said, was also problematic.
18350	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Still, the study exposes a vulnerability in a field that is constantly stretched because of pressure to see patients rapidly, he said.
18351	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Whatever strategy people develop for a discharge procedure should be sure it includes real-time communication and an opportunity to ask questions," Bachur said, particularly in emergency departments.
18352	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"That could make some of the concerns in this article obsolete."
18353	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Tips for emergency department patients
18354	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Always ask for printed discharge information - and be certain you understand what it says.
18355	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Making sure you really get what you're supposed to do when you go home is important," said Dr. Kirsten G. Engel, a clinical instructor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.
18356	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Bring a friend or family member.
18357	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"Patients are sick, they're anxious, tired, frustrated," Engel said.
18358	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"It's hard to absorb information when you're like that."
18359	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Understand that healthcare providers are there to help you, and that you can trust them.
18361	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"And that's really where the whole secret to successful medical care lies."
18362	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Ask questions.
18363	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If you don't know or are uncomfortable, ask or tell," Wolfe said.
18364	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"There's no symptom or issue that's too small to communicate - it's more the unanswered questions that can create problems."

18373	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	"If Ismael Khan's current efforts fail, Kabul will be plunged into a new and bitter round of fighting," warned his aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
18374	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	The Herat governor was to meet Hekmatyar at his headquarters in the eastern district of Charasiab.
18375	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	A close associate of Rabbani, Ismael Khan will impress upon Hekmatyar that his mission offered a last opportunity to end the fighting, the aide said.

18378	AFP_ENG_19940613.0117.LDC2007T07	Sources in Ismael Khan's delegation, comprising officials from several western provinces, said the peace mission had taken on special importance following the recent apparent rejection of special UN envoy Mehmoud Mestiri's peace proposals.

18394	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	2.7 million gallons) of oil gushed Friday from the Hong Kong-registered tanker after a crane-carrying barge slammed into it.
18395	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The spill was the country's largest, involving twice as much oil as the worst previous spill in 1995.
18396	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The accident occurred about 7 miles (11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach.
18397	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Strong winds and prevailing currents have spread the oil slick to an area about 1 mile (2 kilometers) wide and 10 miles (20 kilometers) in length, Jung said.
18398	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	YTN television showed a contaminated beach, with some rocks and sand stained in black.
18399	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The Coast Guard planned to mobilize 103 vessels and six helicopters Saturday in an effort to clean it up, Jung said, adding that the operation was expected to take at least three days.

18416	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
18417	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, reeling under a negative TV ad campaign from rival Mitt Romney, said Monday he made a last-minute decision to pull an anti-Romney ad he had shipped to Iowa stations.
18418	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
18419	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge gamble on my part.
18420	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
18421	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll probably be the last guy to ever do this."
18422	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said, appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads despite the fact that history indicates they work.
18424	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
18425	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.
18426	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A McClatchy/MSNBC poll conducted Dec. 3-6 showed Huckabee in first place, 12 points ahead of runner-up Romney.
18427	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	But last week, the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was second.
18428	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
18429	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign
18430	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	and on the other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
18431	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	And I think that's a very confusing and puzzling message," he said, referring to the news coverage that is sure to spread the Huckabee ad's message.
18432	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Madden branded Huckabee's decision to pull the ad but show it at a news conference as "a bizarre display of hypocrisy."
18433	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee told reporters he showed them the ad because if he didn't, "you'd say, 'Where's the ad?"
18434	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The ad was produced Sunday and shipped to Iowa stations to begin airing Monday.
18435	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.
18437	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"If a man's dishonest to obtain a job, he'll be dishonest on the job."
18438	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	University of Iowa political scientist Peverill Squire said Huckabee's move "suggests the campaign is a bit more amateur than its competition."
18439	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
18440	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	On the Democratic side, a Reuters-C-SPAN-Zogby poll released Monday and conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Clinton at 30 percent among likely caucus-goers
18441	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama and Edwards each were at 26 percent.
18442	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The margin of error is 3.3 percentage points, making it a statistical three-way tie.
18443	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A previous poll last week had Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
18444	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Edwards is pushing a populist message that is finding a receptive audience in Iowa.
18445	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti- Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
18446	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton targeted Edwards during a stop in Keokuk, apparently mocking his animated attacks on special interests.
18447	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's not something you have to do by yelling and screaming.
18448	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Save your energy.
18449	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Get the job done," she said about battles in Washington.

18451	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as first lady amounted to chatting over tea.
18452	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Over the weekend, she responded sharply to these jabs, noting that she was the first high-level American to go to Bosnia after the Dayton peace accords.
18453	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"We landed in one of those cork screw landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire - I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac," she said.
18454	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Last Friday, Obama suggested his global experience eclipses the eight years Clinton spent as first lady.
18455	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's that experience, that understanding, not just of what world leaders I went and talked to in the ambassador's house I had tea with, but understanding the lives of the people like my grandmother who lives in a tiny hut in Africa," he said.
18456	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout.
18457	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Marion County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus.
18458	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	My job is to be so persuasive that you conclude 'I've got to go for Obama.

18460	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	All three Democrats found themselves negatively depicted in a last-minute round of phone calls to likely caucus-goers in Iowa.
18461	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In each case, recipients told the Associated Press that a caller pretending to conduct a poll of candidate preferences began by asking who the caucus-goer intends to support.

18497	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Tingting said she and her sister now eat three times more than ordinary people do and have gained more than five kilos since 2007.
18498	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The added weight helped them to improve strength and stability in water.
18499	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The girls said they were grateful for their coach Imura for their achievements.
18500	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"She is a very stringent coach, but she also takes very good care of us," said Wenwen at the April tournament.
18502	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	She started to coach in China after the Doha Games.
18503	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Imura said the twins, among other swimmers, have improved markedly in strength, technique and speed in the past two years.
18504	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The seasoned coach said she is determined to bring the girls to win a medal at the Olympics.
18505	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"We hope we can do better than the fourth in duet and team routines in the Melbourne World Championships last year," she said.
18508	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	But a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma adopted Saturday an amendment to their constitution that strips membership from so- called "Freedmen," those descended from slaves once owned by Cherokees, blacks who were married to Cherokees and children of mixed-race families.
18510	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"Their voice is clear as to who should be citizens of the Cherokee Nation.
18511	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	No one else has the right to make that determination."
18513	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"This is a sad chapter in Cherokee history," Taylor Keen, a Cherokee tribal council member who opposes the amendment, told the New York Times.
18514	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"But this is not my Cherokee Nation.
18515	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	My Cherokee Nation is one that honors all parts of her past."
18516	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Advocates of changing the 141-year-old treaty rules defining who is a Cherokee say the tribal nation has a sovereign right to decide citizenship and that other tribes base membership on blood lines.
18517	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	The Cherokee Nation, which ranks as the second-largest tribe behind the Navajo, has some 250,000 to 270,000 members and is growing rapidly.
18520	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	After the war, the federal government in an 1866 treaty ordered the slaves freed.
18521	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	In 1983, the Cherokee Nation expelled many descendants of slaves as members but a Cherokee tribunal ruled last year that the Freedmen were fully-fledged citizens with voting rights.
18522	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	That court decision prompted Saturday's special vote.
18524	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Election results will remain unofficial until certified by the Cherokee Nation Election Commission, but officials said percentages were not expected to change significantly.
18525	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	KURDS ASSERT CONTROL OVER KIRKUK
18526	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	KIRKUK, Iraq
18527	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
18528	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
18529	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	No, Najat told the caller.
18530	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after hanging up, he wryly revealed the deeper truth about Kirkuk, combustible for its mix of ethnicities floating together on a sea of oil: The Kurds already control it.
18531	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It's true," Najat said.
18532	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
18534	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The explosive quarrel over the city is one major barrier to creating stable political structures in the rest of Iraq.
18535	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Beyond that, it demonstrates that despite a recent decline in violence, Iraq's unsettled ethnic and regional discord could still upend directives emanating from Baghdad and destabilize large regions of the country -- or even set off a civil war.
18536	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	This month, legislation in the national parliament to set the groundwork for crucial provincial elections collapsed in a bitter dispute over Kirkuk, as Arabs and Turkmens demanded that the Kurds be forced to cede some of their power here.
18537	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But with the Kurds having already consolidated their authority in Kirkuk, there seemed little chance -- short of a military intervention -- of that happening.
18538	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authority is visible everywhere in the city.
18539	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In addition to the provincial government and command of the police, the Kurds control the Asaish, the feared undercover security service that works with the U.S. military and, according to Asaish commanders, U.S. intelligence agencies.
18540	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the best intelligence.
18541	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
18543	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago, rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
18546	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All in all, U.S. officials say they believe, far more people were killed and wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
18547	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
18549	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.
18550	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish police commanders promise an impartial investigation of the bombing and its aftermath, overseen by officers from all of the city's ethnic groups.
18553	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs and Turkmens.
18555	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"The Asaish are saying they will annex Kirkuk by force, and that is terrifying people."
18556	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
18557	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an outbreak of ethnic fighting.
18558	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The city's Arabs, said Khalil, "will not stay handcuffed by Kurdish actions."
18559	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Kurdish families were driven out of Kirkuk, replaced by Arabs as part of his drive to obtain a firmer political grip on the enormous oil reserves here.
18560	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing in Kurds.
18561	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
18562	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan region.
18563	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	They also warn that any plan involuntarily stripping them of power will be harshly contested.
18569	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The troops took up positions in the city.
18570	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
18571	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major Arab security force after the July 28 violence.
18572	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The U.S. military commander here, Col. David Paschal, said he feared that if Baghdad sent in additional troops, Kurdish leaders would retaliate by sending in their own militia from northern Iraq, creating a potentially disastrous confrontation.
18573	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"I just saw this continued escalation of force happening," he said.
18574	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Baghdad is expected to withdraw the troops, according to U.S. commanders.
18575	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said he blames all the political parties for inflaming tensions to serve their interests.
18576	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.
18577	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Negotiations here are, 'You give me everything I want, and I will walk away happy,"' he said.
18578	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred."
18579	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
18580	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic, a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be seen standing in a sea of demonstrators.
18581	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	He ritualistically raises his hands, palms up, toward his face, then lowers them to his side.
18582	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	An instant later the explosion engulfs him and everyone around him.
18583	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed.
18585	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video captured the crowd furiously beating Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him!
18586	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kill him!"
18589	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.
18590	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurdish authorities have sought to play down the intensity of the fight between the Kurds and the Turkmens, but Paschal said most of the casualties were sustained during the riot.
18591	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since last summer.
18592	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds attribute some of that improvement to the Asaish.
18593	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are in direct contact with the people," said Hemin Shafiq, a 24-year-old policeman.
18594	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They are more rapid.
18595	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	That is why they are much more active than the police."
18597	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	That might explain why they have more power."
18598	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Turhan admitted that the Asaish officers were, at times, more powerful than the police, and he said there were thousands of Asaish in the city, though Kurdish officials say there are no more than 1,000.
18599	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They have a major role combating terrorism, but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties," he said.
18601	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he praised their ability to ferret out information.
18602	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Maybe they have better sources than me," he said.

18612	APW_ENG_20070612.0328.LDC2009T13	The virus remains difficult for people to catch, but experts fear it could eventually mutate to a form that spreads more easily between humans, sparking a global pandemic that could kill millions.
18613	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	GORDON TAKES CONTROL OF PLAYOFF RACE
18614	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	CONCORD, N.C.
18615	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Jeff Gordon has little to prove in a career that has left him among the best drivers to have ever competed in NASCAR.
18616	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has four Cup championships, and his legacy is already secure.
18617	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That does not stop him from pushing for more.
18618	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing that says I need to do this or I need to do that, or I haven't done this and so this is what's left," Gordon said Thursday as he prepared for the Bank of America 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
18619	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm just trying to be competitive and continue to get that great feeling of what it's like to win races and battle for championships and hope that we've got what it takes to do it."
18620	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	So far, he still does.
18622	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In a two-lap overtime sprint to the finish, Gordon then held off Clint Bowyer to take the checkered flag for his second consecutive victory.
18623	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He also took control of the playoff chase.
18624	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He has a 68-point lead on his teammate Jimmie Johnson, who finished 14th, and a 78-point on Bowyer, who finished second as he continues to assert himself in the playoff.
18625	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	With five races to go in the Chase, they are the only three drivers with a realistic shot at winning the title.
18626	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon came into the race in a slump at Lowe's, having failed to finish each of his last five races here dating back to 2005.
18627	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, Johnson came into the race with five victories at Lowe's and an air of invincibility here.
18628	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Johnson experienced a rare spin-out with 104 laps to go and fell to 30th, before climbing back.
18629	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	"This is what we were looking for, getting a win at Charlotte," Gordon said as he celebrated in victory lane.
18630	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	In the final laps, Gordon had a comfortable lead on Kyle Busch, his Hendrick Motorsports teammate when the race was red-flagged for a little more than 12 minutes after a late crash left oil on the track.
18631	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
18633	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
18634	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the playoff chase into a one-man race.
18635	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He dominated through the first 200 laps of the event.
18636	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But a long stay on pit road to replace a part dropped him down to 16th place with just over 120 laps to go.
18637	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson appeared on his way up the field when he spun out.
18638	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.
18639	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Johnson, who won his first title last year, can become the first driver since Gordon to win back-to-back championships in the Cup series since Gordon pulled off that feat in 1997-98.
18640	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	It appears the two-time champion Tony Stewart will not be a threat.
18641	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of the race.
18642	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Stewart's No. 20 Chevrolet sustained damage on the right front and he dropped back to 28th.
18643	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Although Stewart finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.

18725	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	The two sides exchanged views on expanding cooperation in the information industry.
18726	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel announced it will build a huge new plant in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
18727	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel already has two chip plants in Shanghai Municipality and Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
18728	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	The plant, to be located in a high-tech zone north of Dalian's city proper, will be one of Intel's eight factories worldwide to produce 300-millimetre integrated wafers after it becomes operational in the first half of 2010.
18729	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Construction of the plant will start before the end of this year, Intel said in a press release.
18730	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	The new project will make Intel "one of the largest foreign investors in China" with nearly four billion U.S. dollars of investment, said Otellini at Monday's press conference.
18731	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel has invested 1.3 billion U.S. dollars over the past two decades and China has become its second largest market.

18739	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	he said.
18740	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the provincial health department confirmed that cholera bacteria had been found in the Limpopo river.
18742	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Samples taken, which include raw sewage, would indicate whether cholera is present in waste water.
18743	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"Further tests will help determine whether potable water quality has deteriorated since the last round of sampling," Maseko said.
18745	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said it was not clear when the results for the river, which serves communities in Madombo and Masisi, would be released.
18746	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	On Friday, Maskeo said the government would send a delegation to Zimbabwe on Monday to assess the deteriorating food and humanitarian crisis.

18753	XIN_ENG_20080507.0176.LDC2009T13	"Slovakia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on Jan. 1, 2009," said Joaquin Almunia, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
18759	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It announced the hijacking on Monday when it first received the information.
18760	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The statement posted on Vela's Web site late Monday said the ship was hijacked Sunday.
18761	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The discrepancy could not immediately be explained.
18763	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	A coalition of warships from eight nations, as well as from NATO and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is patrolling a critical zone in the Gulf of Aden leading to and from the Suez Canal.
18764	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	That's where most of the more than 80 attacks this year have occurred.
18769	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.
18770	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea," Christensen said.
18772	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	It is "the largest pirated vessel in the region" to date, Christensen said.
18773	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	At 1,080 feet (329 meters), it is the length of an aircraft carrier and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
18774	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"We are very concerned that a (ship) of this size has been hijacked.
18776	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"Of course, as long as there is no firm deterrent, pirates will continue to attack.
18777	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	The risk is low and returns are extremely high.
18778	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	You will see more and more of such attacks," he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
18782	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"As usual, I woke up at 3 a.m. and headed for the sea to fish, but I saw a very, very large ship anchored less than three miles (five kilometers) off the shore," he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
18783	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	He said two small boats floated out to the ship and 18 men -- presumably other pirates -- climbed aboard with ropes woven into a ladder.
18784	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"I have been fishing here for three decades, but I have never seen a ship as big as this one," he said.
18785	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	"There are dozens of spectators on shore trying to catch a glimpse of the large ship, which they can see with their naked eyes."
18787	APW_ENG_20081118.0379.LDC2009T13	Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19 vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers and five product tankers of various sizes.

18798	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The spacecraft has been planned to be launched at an appropriate time between Sept. 25 and 30 after the spaceship, its carrier Long-March II-F rocket and the escape tower were vertically transferred to the launch pad on Saturday.
18799	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	All the six astronauts prepared for Shenzhou-7 were once trained and tested at Jiuquan center more than two weeks ago when they had a live experience to enter the spaceship and learned the mission's whole process in an all-ready simulation.
18800	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The six spacemen now had moved to their special accommodation to be quarantined and to adjust their psychological conditions for the mission.
18801	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The Long-March II-F rocket, developed in 1992, is said to be the most complicated and reliable carrier rocket in China's aviation history with all its launch mission successfully finished.
18802	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	So far the rocket had sent two manned spacecraft and four unmanned into space.
18803	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	Since October 1996, the Long-March series rockets have successfully launched for 108 times.

18806	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"The upgrading work will be finished by two steps," Jin told Xinhua.
18807	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	"all its technical parameters and designs will be replaced."
18808	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	According to Jin, the first step will make the rocket lighter, smaller, more powerful and more integrated by improving its controlling and guiding parts and electronic devices.
18809	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The second step will change the fuel of the rocket, replacing its current combustion-supporting material by a new generation of full liquid oxygen.
18810	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	On April 12, China launched a new space tracking ship to serve the Shenzhou-7 spacewalk mission.
18811	XIN_ENG_20080921.0217.LDC2009T13	The new ship and its sister, Yuanwang-5 which was put into use a year ago, will play a key role in monitoring and controlling the Shenzhou-7 mission.

18856	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy, left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating concerns about inflation.
18857	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
18858	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
18859	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep easing.
18860	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
18862	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, he is not a voting member of the FOMC this year.
18863	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.
18864	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
18865	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday before the Fed announcement, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 2006 as strong consumer spending and an improving trade picture offset severe slowdowns in housing and auto production.
18866	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said, "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."
18867	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
18869	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
18870	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough waters of a severe housing slump.
18871	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a considerable period.
18872	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	And some are worried that there could be rate hikes in the second half of the year if inflation does not slow further.
18873	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed last changed rates back in June when it pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, up to 5.25 percent.
18874	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It marked the 17th consecutive meeting that the central bank had nudged rates up by a quarter-point.
18875	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Before the Fed started raising rates in June 2004, the funds rate was at 1 percent and the prime rate stood at 4 percent, both the lowest levels in more than four decades.
18876	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

18882	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Polls show the former New York mayor could finish fourth, or even lower, in today's New Hampshire primary, after a fifth-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.
18885	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a finish would do nothing, she said, to change Giuliani's strategy, which relies on competing in larger states with more convention delegates at stake .
18886	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	But many analysts question whether Giuliani can remain competitive in those large states without at least some hint of success in the early rounds.
18887	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The last Detroit News-WXYZ Action News poll of Republican voters, in mid-December, showed Giuliani in third place at 12 percent, down 16 points from a month earlier.
18888	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"History says he needs some success before Florida to be successful in Florida," said Peter Brown of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which has surveyed Florida voters throughout the year.
18889	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The danger, Brown said, is that the lead Giuliani held in Florida and other large states throughout the summer and fall may disappear .
18890	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's camp has fought against such perceptions for months
18892	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Of course, no such sweep has developed.
18893	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa winner Mike Huckabee is an also-ran in New Hampshire, where Romney and McCain are battling in a close race.
18894	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	After Michigan comes South Carolina's Jan. 19 primary, in which Huckabee, McCain, Romney and Fred Thompson all have gotten significant support in recent polls.
18895	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Such a fractured field is all Giuliani could have hoped for, said Miller.
18896	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"We talked about this strategy very early on: Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," she said.
18897	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	"It makes some people nervous, but we've talked about it for months: The thing to do is to win delegates."
18898	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	The math is compelling.
18899	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	New Hampshire today will award 21 delegates to this summer's national convention
18900	NYT_ENG_20080107.0181.LDC2009T13	Iowa technically awarded none at all.

18985	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He plays Charlie Crews, a cop who spent 12 years in jail for murder before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.
18986	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Now back on the force, extremely wealthy from a settlement, Charlie is altogether loopy.
18988	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	In between bites of an apple, he blithely admits to anyone who'll listen that he hates cops.
18989	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is helpless when it comes to all the technological advances that occurred while he was in jail.
18990	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	But throughout all the silly quips and nonsensical exclamations, Lewis makes it subtly clear that Charlie's daffiness sits on top of a gusher of emotion.

18992	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	we can tell that his lightheartedness is but a thin veneer.
18993	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And when he's interrogating suspects, his fury clearly rears its head.
18994	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Is Charlie about to go off the deep end?
18995	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Lewis, with his red hair, pale face, and nonchalant expression, is compelling as he toys with Charlie's balance.
18997	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And he is surrounded by a distinctive cast.
18998	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Sarah Shahi, from "The L Word" and the "Sopranos" episode in which Tony ate magic mushrooms, is likable as Charlie's untrusting new partner.
18999	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Robin Weigart, who was Calamity Jane on "Deadwood," exudes a strong but ambiguous presence as the lieutenant.
19000	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And Adam Arkin is sweet as Charlie's former cellmate who now lives above the garage at Charlie's mansion.
19001	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And, on top of it all, the "Life" back story, which appears to involve the people who set up Charlie for the murder charge in 1994, is promising.
19002	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	While each episode will focus on a particular criminal case and its resolution, like most TV procedurals, the larger mystery about Charlie will unfold gradually.
19003	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	After one episode, I was already curious about what landed Charlie in jail.
19004	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	The premiere is presented partly as a documentary about Charlie, on the occasion of his release from jail, and clearly some of those featured in the reel were responsible for his incarceration.
19005	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	So why do I fear that, despite all its pluses, this show is not long for the world?
19006	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	For one thing, as good as Lewis is, Charlie may be too strange for mainstream consumption.
19007	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	He's a hard character to understand, although I am certain that, ultimately, he is understandable.
19008	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	And then with the TV lineups so dense with cop shows, "Life" may not have a flashy enough gimmick to attract viewers in the first place.
19009	NYT_ENG_20070925.0140.LDC2009T13	Somehow, a show known as "the Damian Lewis vehicle" or "the kooky cop's show" does not exactly call out for an audience.

19158	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	first video in 3 years
19160	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
19161	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
19162	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Still, bin Laden's appearance would be significant.
19163	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The al-Qaida leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004, and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his longest period without a message.
19164	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
19165	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black.
19166	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In his past videos, bin Laden's beard was almost entirely gray with dark streaks.
19167	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror messages.
19168	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
19169	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al- Sahab, frequently posts messages.
19170	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al- Sahab.
19171	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Such announcements are usually put out one to three days before the video is posted on the Web.
19172	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours, before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
19173	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
19175	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
19176	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	It's drawn to video releases."
19177	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But the fact that bin Laden is delivering the message is significant, he said.
19178	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
19180	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
19181	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would only underscore the threat the United States and other nations face from extremists.
19183	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the U.S. presidential elections.
19184	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
19185	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.
19186	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	His last audiotape was on July 1, 2006, in which he welcomed new leader of al-Qaida in Iraq succeeding the slain Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
19187	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
19188	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	That absence sparked widespread speculation he was ill, wounded or possibly dead.
19189	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	There has been little such speculation since then.
19190	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.
19191	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	He is thought to be hiding in the tribal regions of western Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
19192	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	During bin Laden's silence, his deputy Egyptian-born Ayman al- Zawahri has been frequently issuing videos and audiotapes.
19193	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Al-Zawahri appeared in a 2006 video marking the 9-11 anniversary.

19198	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The International Rugby Board (IRB) Council said Thursday it had approved a global trial of Experimental Law Variations (ELVs) designed to reduce the number of turnover situations in a match for a 12-month period starting on August 1, 2008.
19200	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The new rules were introduced on an experimental basis in approved tournaments around the world since 2006 and now will be rolled out in the northern hemisphere, the IRB said in a statement.
19201	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	"The Council's decision to implement a global trial of Experimental Law Variations represents an important milestone for the future of the Game.
19202	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	It vindicates the process that was adopted by Council in 2004 for future Law amendments.
19204	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The ELVs are essentially designed to help promote more ball in play and attractive free-flowing rugby and have already been trialled in the southern hemisphere.
19205	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB added it had agreed that ELVs concerning sanctions not already approved for global trials would be further trialled in a selected elite Northern Hemisphere competition in the 2008/09 season.
19206	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The IRB continued: "The Southern Hemisphere will continue to play under the various ELV programme environments that exist in that part of the world at present.
19208	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	The rule changes came after a laws study group was tasked with suggesting changes to speed up the game while reducing the influence of penalty-kicks which would in future only result from foul play and offside.
19209	AFP_ENG_20080501.0141.LDC2009T13	Other offences would merit a free-kick or scrum award.

19255	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Mary-Kate Olsen calls Heath Ledger a "friend" in a brief statement released Friday, the first word from the "Full House" star since the Australian-born actor's death.

19260	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	Police said the masseuse who found Ledger's body Tuesday spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialing the police-fire emergency dispatcher for help.

19262	APW_ENG_20080125.1176.LDC2009T13	At some point during the frenzy, Olsen, who was in California, summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help, police said.

19281	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
19283	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Now he was spending his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather evidence against Taylor.
19284	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	At night he watched baseball with court officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
19285	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I told them we believe," Bility says.
19286	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"We always believe."
19287	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	What Bility believes in most is the power of an independent press.
19290	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor, who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone.
19291	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."
19292	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close.
19293	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He suffers hearing loss in his left ear after being beaten badly in 1997 during his first arrest.
19294	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His elbows bear scars from the aftermath of his seventh and final arrest: For six months in 2002 his jailers often tied his elbows behind his back until they touched each other
19295	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
19296	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He's regained feeling in an arm numbed by the torture, but his shoulder still bothers him.
19298	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He resisted Taylor's insistence that he accept exile once freed but acquiesced after a prison guard passed him a note from his mother imploring him to agree to flee.
19300	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He now speaks and writes about his troubled homeland.
19302	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and is expected to last at least a year.
19303	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor was president of Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in 2003.
19304	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape, mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its abundant natural resources.
19305	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.
19307	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He escaped from the Plymouth House of Corrections in 1985 while awaiting extradition.
19308	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Staying strong
19310	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I had witnessed a lot of abuses, a lot of murders.
19312	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I felt it was necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
19314	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Remarkably, in that little safe haven, Liberia went from having no human rights community to having a thriving human rights community.
19315	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says.
19316	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"In the human rights community he was very much a household name."
19317	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility was first arrested the year Taylor was elected president.
19318	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on trial.
19319	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"That issue was taboo," Bility recalls.
19320	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I reported on it extensively.
19321	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	My colleagues said, 'You are reckless.
19322	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That guy could kill you.'
19323	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That was the battle line."
19324	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was released after two days without having been charged.
19325	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
19326	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There he reported on gang rapes, mass arrests, and executions.
19327	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
19328	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Government agents pretending to peddle a corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4 -year-old son.
19329	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to Taylor's home, Bility recalls.
19330	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Charles Taylor introduced me.
19331	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	'Gentlemen, this is the guy who wants to overthrow me,"' Bility says.
19332	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He is sitting at his desk.
19333	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is sitting on the floor.
19334	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He said, 'Have a seat.'
19335	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I sat on a chair.
19336	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A minister said, 'What are you doing?
19337	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Do you compare yourself to the president?"'
19339	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He spent the next six months incommunicado in various prison cells, including one underground hole only 3 feet high and half-filled with water.
19340	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
19341	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
19343	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
19344	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"If I had a heart condition," Bility says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
19345	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once Taylor visited him in prison.
19346	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
19347	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He looked up and said, 'My birds.'
19348	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That scared me."
19349	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Through all this, Bility never made a false confession.
19350	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
19351	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His first inkling that his plight had attracted international attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong.
19352	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
19353	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"From that day on I had hope."
19354	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Coming to Boston
19355	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The torture stopped, and for two months Bility's captors worked to make him presentable to the outside world.
19356	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They sent a doctor.
19357	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They cut his thick, matted hair.
19358	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He refused to go into exile.
19359	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
19361	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Finally, Bility agreed to leave Liberia.
19363	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
19364	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	And he had heard of the Celtics.
19365	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In January 2003, Bility moved to Massachusetts.
19366	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He neglected advice to seek counseling to help him recover from the torture he'd suffered.
19367	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I thought I really didn't need it.
19368	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I was completely traumatized.
19369	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Each time I would see a police officer my heart would pump up," he says.
19370	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"What helped me was to speak about it.
19371	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The more I spoke about it, the less stressful it became, and things became normal."
19373	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility wants more, however.

19398	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his response.

19424	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new "Transformers" movie boasts a good cast, but it's got nothing on the original.
19425	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In a classic bit of movie trivia, the little-seen 1986 animated film "Transformers: The Movie" was Orson Welles' last film.
19426	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Yes, that Orson Welles.
19427	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The filmmaking legend who remade cinema with "Citizen Kane" (which just again topped AFI's list of 100 greatest movies), directed "Touch of Evil," starred in "The Third Man," impeccably adapted Shakespeare to the screen and panicked the nation with his infamous radio broadcast of "War of the Worlds" -- concluded his career by playing Unicron, an evil shape-shifting planet moon.
19428	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was 70 at the time and in poor health.
19429	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His last released film was 1987's "Someone to Love," but that was shot before Welles lent his voice to "Transformers."
19430	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Late in his career, Welles often took to commercials and narration work as a source of income.
19432	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	She recalls Welles telling her shortly before he died that he had spent the day "playing a toy."
19433	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"That was for him a way of earning a living and a way of trying to finance the films that he wanted to make," says Leaming.
19434	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Obviously in those years, there's a tremendous sadness except that the thing he used to always say to me was, `The one thing that's helped me to survive is that I'm not bitter.'"
19435	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Having built his reputation in theater and radio, Welles' immediate, astounding success as a 25-year-old filmmaker with "Citizen Kane" (1941) is Hollywood legend.
19436	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Though he went on to create a number of masterpieces (among them "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Othello"), he is often viewed as failing to recapture his early brilliance.
19437	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In his later decades, Welles had great difficulty gaining financing for his film projects.
19438	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Leaming says he used to refer to parts like "Transformers" as "a job of work," but says he was nevertheless full of ideas and spoke passionately of plans for various movies even on his deathbed.
19439	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He died of a heart attack in October 1985.
19440	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He was absolutely the same man who made `Citizen Kane,'" says Leaming of the aged Welles.
19441	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	His voice work in "Transformers: The Movie" was so weak that it was altered with synthesizers until it hardly sounded like him.
19443	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"He came in ... and said, `I'm playing an entire planet!'"
19444	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Dille recalled on a DVD of the film released last year.
19445	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The part is in some ways typical of the characters to which Welles was drawn.
19447	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Welles was not the only famous talent to lend his voice to "Transformers: The Movie."
19448	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	He was joined by Eric Idle ("Monty Python"), Leonard Nimoy ("Star Trek"), Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club") and Robert Stack ("Unsolved Mysteries").
19449	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	In this way, "Transformers: The Movie" presaged a contemporary commonplace: cartoons voiced by stars.
19450	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Today, an animated film wouldn't dream of not casting well-known performers.
19451	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"It was groundbreaking to introduce these famous actors in an animated feature," "Transformers: The Movie" producer Joe Bacal says on the DVD.
19452	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Back in 1986, though, it wasn't the payday it is now.
19453	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	"Transformers: The Movie" yielded less than $6 million at the box office.
19454	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The new live-action "Transformers," which opens in theaters July 3, hopes to reap that in a matter of hours.
19455	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	The path of "Transformers" reflects the changed nature of Hollywood.
19456	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	What began as a toy for children in the early '80s, has now become an enormous, global Goliath of pop-culture product, meant as much for adults as kids.
19457	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	It's a destiny for "Transformers" that few could have imagined in 1986, even Welles himself.
19458	APW_ENG_20070629.0114.LDC2009T13	Indeed, "Transformers: The Movie" is set in the distant future: the year 2005.

19504	AFP_ENG_20070412.0374.LDC2009T13	ECB watchers are nevertheless expecting the ECB to tighten monetary conditions again in the coming months, with the overwhelming majority of analysts betting on a rise in the refi to 4.0 percent in June.

19511	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	China's Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday issued a notice to call for intensified prevention and control of blue-ear pig disease as the country is entering the peak season for the disease.
19512	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The highly pathogenic blue-ear disease, also known as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), has already killed 18,000 pigs this year.
19513	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice said local governments should improve the emergency plans for the disease outbreak and section off and cease pork trading in affected areas at the time of an outbreak.
19514	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	New vaccines for the disease, produced under the supervision of China's Veterinary Medicine Supervisory Institution, have been put into use, said the notice.
19515	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Local governments should establish immunity records for pigs, it said.
19516	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said local authorities should increase studies on the cause of the disease and strengthen inspections and quarantine of pig delivery.
19517	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Pig breeders have been ordered not to kill, eat, sale and deliver pigs that have died from the disease and treat the dead animals and their excrement properly, according to the notice.
19518	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The notice also said stricter disinfection measures should be taken in small pig farms.
19519	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	Between January and May, 45,000 pigs contracted the disease, but a ministry source failed to specify what provinces and regions had reported outbreaks.
19521	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The ministry has dispatched inspection teams to supervise disease control and prevention work.
19522	XIN_ENG_20070607.0292.LDC2009T13	The outbreaks have contributed to rising pork prices in some areas.

19545	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Taddei saved a shot from Udinese striker Fabio Quagliarella on the goal-line in the 33rd, and Totti came close on a free kick as time expired in the first half.
19546	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	Before the victory over Udinese, Roma had managed just one win in its previous five away games.
19547	APW_ENG_20080413.0540.LDC2009T13	The goals by Vucinic, Taddei and Giuly were the sixth of the Serie A season for each player.

19555	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Investors loved it.
19556	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Central bankers worried about it.
19557	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	And though analysts could never measure its true size, most agreed it was a prime source of the cheap money that washed through global markets in recent years.
19558	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
19560	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
19561	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The markets have now had a real-world look at what happens when that edifice of debt unravels.
19562	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
19563	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
19565	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	"These are trades that everybody in our business knew were going to come unstuck."
19566	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	The days of the yen carry trade, he predicted, "are pretty much over."
19567	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Initially, converting all that borrowed yen into other currencies depressed the value of the yen.
19570	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
19572	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.
19574	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But the volatility will eventually dissipate, he predicted, and when it does, "the carry trade will resume."
19576	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	To many observers, the Japanese -- especially older Japanese with substantial savings -- remain averse to taking chances with their investments.

19588	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The mother of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager whose life-ending battle with AIDS in the 1980s engrossed Americans, wants to meet with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to discuss his comments 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been isolated.
19589	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The former Arkansas governor and Republican front-runner in the important Iowa caucuses said Sunday that he stood by the comments.
19590	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	That has infuriated Jeanne White-Ginder, who said: "It's so alarming to me."
19591	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In a telephone interview Monday with The Associated Press from her home in Leesburg, Florida, she said: "It's very important to me that we don't live in the darkness" when people thought AIDS was transmitted through casual contact, such as by "kissing, tears, sweat and saliva."
19592	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"We have to treat this disease like a disease, and like Ryan always said, not like a dirty word," she said.
19593	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	White was 13 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984, having contracted the disease from the blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
19594	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He was barred from school the following year out of fear the disease was spread casually.
19595	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	He died in 1990 at age 18.
19596	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, and the AIDS Institute were sending a letter to Huckabee asking him to meet with White-Ginder -- who declined in the interview to say what political party she belongs to -- and calling his comments "completely beyond comprehension."
19597	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	As a Senate candidate in 1992, Huckabee told the AP in a questionnaire that "we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague" if the federal government was going to deal with the spread of the disease effectively.
19598	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents," he said then.
19599	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	In an interview on "Fox News Sunday," Huckabee denied that those words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population, although he did not explain how else isolation would be achieved.
19600	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I didn't say we should quarantine," he said.
19601	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	The idea was not to "lock people up."
19602	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then, and since, that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through casual contact, but said that was not certain.
19603	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I still believe this today," Huckabee said Sunday, that "we were acting more out of political correctness" in responding to the AIDS crisis.
19604	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	"I don't run from it, I don't recant it," he said of his position in 1992.
19605	APW_ENG_20071211.0644.LDC2009T13	Yet he said he would state his view differently in retrospect.

19837	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	It ' s OK to skip mouth-to-mouth and do ' hands-only ' CPR for cardiac arrest in adults
19839	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the chest to save a life.
19841	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Experts hope bystanders will now be more willing to jump in and help if they see someone suddenly collapse.
19842	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR is simpler and easier to remember and removes a big barrier for people skittish about the mouth-to-mouth breathing.
19843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
19844	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
19845	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
19846	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.
19847	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used.
19848	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
19849	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.
19850	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But in either case, "Something is better than nothing," Sayre said.
19851	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
19852	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
19853	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	those "unable or unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
19854	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR.
19855	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.
19856	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Sayre said the association took the unusual step of making the changes now -- the next update was not due until 2010 -- because three studies last year showed hands-only was as good as traditional CPR.
19857	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only will be added to CPR training.
19858	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
19859	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Only about 6 percent of those who are stricken outside a hospital survive, although rates vary by location.
19860	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	People who quickly get CPR while awaiting medical treatment have double or triple the chance of surviving.
19861	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	But less than a third of victims get this essential help.
19862	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Dr. Gordon Ewy, who's been pushing for hands-only CPR for 15 years, said he was "dancing in the streets" over the heart association's change even though he does not think it goes far enough.
19863	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy is director of the University of Arizona Sarver Heart Center in Tucson, where the compression-only technique was pioneered.
19864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
19865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
19866	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
19867	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.
19868	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's not only the yuck factor."
19869	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In recent years, emergency service dispatchers have been coaching callers in hands-only CPR rather than telling them how to alternate breaths and compressions.
19870	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"They love it.
19873	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February.
19874	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in the meantime.
19875	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until paramedics arrived.
19876	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
19877	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he visited Goodall in the hospital where he is recovering from triple bypass surgery.
19878	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"After this whole thing happened, I was on cloud nine," said Hjelmstad.
19879	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was just fortunate enough to be there."

19891	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 40 percent of males and 16 percent of females who take cocktails of anti-AIDS drugs for their HIV infections develop fat deposits in the stomach, neck and cheeks.
19892	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Called visceral fat, it is associated with higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.
19893	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Such patients typically have abnormally low levels of growth hormone and researchers had hoped that replacing it with genetically engineered human growth hormone -- the same drug used to treat below normal growth rates and can be abused by athletes -- might reverse the effects.
19894	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But previous studies using higher levels of the hormone produced unacceptable side effects, including tissue swelling and pain in the joints.
19895	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon and his colleagues studied 56 HIV-positive patients who had deposits of fat in their stomachs and low blood levels of the hormone.
19896	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half were given daily doses of about 0.33 milligrams of the hormone, well below the 2 to 4 milligrams used in previous studies.
19897	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Half the subjects were given a placebo.
19898	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Over the 18 months of the study, stomach fat dropped by 8.5 percent in the patients receiving the hormone, compared to 1.6 percent in those receiving a placebo.
19899	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The team did not study cardiovascular risk.
19900	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Tests showed some elevation of blood sugar in patients receiving the hormone, particularly those who had abnormal glucose tolerance tests at the beginning of the trial.
19901	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Grinspoon said that future clinical trials should include a diabetes drug, such as metformin, to minimize side effects.
19902	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Another study in the special AIDS-themed issue of JAMA found that rifampicin, a drug commonly used to treat tuberculosis, can interfere with treatment for AIDS.
19903	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The finding was important because about one-third of the HIV-positive people in the world also have TB.
19904	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	(Begin optional trim)
19905	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Dr. Andrew Boulle and his colleagues at the University of Cape Town in South Africa studied nearly 4,000 people who began HIV treatment between 2001 and 2006.
19906	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About half received the most commonly used AIDS drug, nevirapine, And the rest received efavirenz, both of them so-called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
19907	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	About 10 percent of people in the nevirapine group also had TB, and about half of those in the efavirenz group.
19908	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	At the end of six months, 16.3 percent of those who received nevirapine when they were already taking rifampicin for TB had treatment failure marked by high levels of HIV in their blood, compared to 8.3 percent of those who did not have TB.
19909	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Rifampicin did not interfere with the efavirenz treatment, however, Boulle told the meeting.
19910	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	It also did not interfere with nevirapine if the patients contracted TB while they were taking the AIDS drug.
19911	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	The researchers do not know why the drug interferes with HIV treatment.
19912	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	(End optional trim)
19913	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	A third study looked at HIV treatment of injection drug abusers.
19914	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Some researchers have claimed that treatment provides little benefit in this group because they are not sufficiently motivated to take their AIDS drugs regularly.
19916	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	After an average of five years of treatment, he reported, 26 percent of the drug users had died from all causes, compared to 22 percent of the other AIDS patients -- a difference that was not statistically significant.
19917	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
19918	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.

19922	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Mike VI, a 2-year old Bengal-Siberian tiger who is expected to grow to 700 pounds, was acquired in August from an animal-rescue center in Indiana.
19925	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"He's one charmed cat."
19926	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That is a widely held view here, where football and a live tiger are seen as essential to the character of the state's flagship university.
19927	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
19928	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
19929	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Perhaps never before have animals been so prominent on the sports landscape.
19930	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous mascot died in May of kidney failure at age 17, representatives of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals asked the school not to get another live tiger.
19931	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.
19932	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting.
19933	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court effectively prohibited the sale of soccer shoes made from kangaroo hides.
19934	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And the National Basketball Association continues to experiment with synthetic materials for its basketballs.
19935	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public sensitivity about the treatment of animals has been acutely evident in the past year, with the outpouring of grief after the death of the 2006 Kentucky Derby champion Barbaro and the national outrage aimed at the NFL quarterback Michael Vick after he acknowledged his involvement in dogfighting.
19939	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"The sheriff may not have made a bust, or may have tipped him off and given him chance to cover up his tracks," Coakley said.
19941	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public attitudes appear to have changed since then.
19943	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
19944	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."
19945	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The ban takes effect in August 2008.
19946	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Last year, the soccer star David Beckham switched from soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin to a synthetic alternative after a campaign by animal-rights groups.
19947	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.
19948	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Response to the court decision has been mixed.
19949	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	While animal- rights groups celebrated, officials in Australia protested, saying that kangaroos are no longer endangered and need to be culled for proper conservation.
19950	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	A bill that would permit products made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California Legislature.
19952	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
19953	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Vick, who has been suspended by the NFL and faces a possible prison sentence, has been widely criticized.
19954	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Yet some observers say that Vick has been subjected to greater outrage and punishment than players who have committed violence against people in shootings, incidents of domestic violence or fatal traffic accidents.
19955	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The LSU case represents perhaps PETA's most visible attempt to dissuade universities from using live mascots.
19956	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU has kept live tigers since 1936.
19957	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	About three dozen schools keep live mascots.
19958	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Others have discontinued the practice as being inhumane or too costly for appropriate care.
19959	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans.
19961	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"Everybody was excited, then the reality of keeping a live animal on campus set in," Chapple said.
19962	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"We weren't set up to handle that."
19963	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates.
19964	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.
19966	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"As grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger.
19967	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
19968	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots.
19969	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In 2005, the university opened a $1 million upgraded habitat.
19970	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	That same year, the University of South Carolina ignored PETA's request that it stop using Gamecocks as a nickname, given that cockfighting is illegal in the state.
19972	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.
19974	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	(At the Indiana rescue facility, Mike VI shared with four other tigers a 20-foot-by
19975	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	foot outdoor concrete enclosure and never saw grass, Dr. David G. Baker, the LSU veterinarian who is the tiger's caretaker, said in an interview.)
19976	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	O'Keefe, noting that tigers were endangered, said that efforts to preserve the exotic cats "will need to be conducted in captivity."
19978	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	LSU also plans to build an education center to inform the public about global conservation issues, he said.
19979	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger will not enter the football stadium for at least LSU's initial two home games, Baker said.
19980	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	First, it will attend soccer games in a portable cage to become acclimated to smaller crowds.
19981	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said.
19982	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And no one will be allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt to make it roar, he said.
19983	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field.
19984	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.
19985	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Referring to PETA officials, Baker said, "According to them, humans don't have the moral authority to eat, own, exhibit or experiment upon animals.
19986	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	I don't share that religion."

20039	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	Authorities are studying different ways of defining the net worth of local enterprises, many of which have reached or come close to the China investment ceilings, the Economic Daily News and United Daily News said.
20040	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	Currently, China-bound investment is capped at 40 percent of a local company's net worth.
20041	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	A more relaxed policy towards China, the island's largest export market and favorite investment site, has been a focus of the two presidential candidates.
20042	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	Ma Ying-jeou, candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), is in favor of friendly ties with the mainland and has called for a further liberalisation and raising of the investment ceilings.
20043	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	The KMT scored a landslide victory in the January 12 parliamentary vote and the win prompted the pro-independence DPP to amend its China policy, observers said.
20044	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	DPP candidate Frank Hsieh also says the government should review restrictions and permit investments to China on a case-by-case basis instead of applying the 40 percent limit across the board.
20046	AFP_ENG_20080121.0681.LDC2009T13	China took some 41 percent of the island's total exports in the first 11 months of last year.

20053	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Later on Saturday initial tests on Forsmark 1's sister reactor, Forsmark 2, also led to its shutdown for similar analysis.
20054	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	"We will do the same work on Forsmark 2 as we are doing on Forsmark 1," Andersson said.
20055	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	It was not known when either of the reactors would resume power production, he added.
20056	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The twin shutdowns follow the emergence earlier in the week of a damning internal report into safety standards at Forsmark, made public six months after a serious incident at the plant.
20057	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	The report blamed lax security on a series of "potentially fatal accidents", including a nitrogen gas leak, employees handling live electrical wires, falls in the workplace and employees sent home for failing sobriety tests.
20058	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	An electricity failure at the facility on July 25, 2006, led to the immediate shutdown of Forsmark 1 after two of four backup generators, which supply power to the reactor's cooling system, malfunctioned for about 20 minutes.
20059	AFP_ENG_20070203.0157.LDC2009T13	Some experts have suggested that a catastrophic reactor meltdown was narrowly avoided.

20070	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he cannot complain about the way things have turned out.
20072	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Two field goals by Robbie Gould, the second one in the fifth minute of overtime, propelled the Bears to a 27-24 victory and catapulted Manning into his third National Football Conference championship game in four seasons.
20073	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	That reversal of fortune mirrored what has happened in Manning's life over the past 10 months.
20074	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
20075	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
20076	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After the news of his latest arrest became public, the Carolina Panthers declined to match the Bears' five-year, $21 million offer for Manning, who was a restricted free agent.
20077	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	The 25-year-old Manning already was on probation from a previous assault in Los Angeles, and if his case had gone to trial he faced the possibility of a prison sentence.
20078	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I wasn't willing to take that risk," he said.
20079	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.
20080	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was suspended for one game by the NFL for violation of its code of personal conduct, causing him to miss the Bears' 17-13 loss at New England on Nov. 26.
20081	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	When he plays, he makes a difference.
20082	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's been a big part of what we're doing," Bears coach Lovie Smith said Monday of Manning, who had five interceptions during the regular season and added a sixth Sunday in the fourth quarter off Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.
20083	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Asked to describe his interception, Manning said, "I guess it's just being in the right place at the right time."
20084	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.
20085	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Later, while putting a square diamond-studded earring in his left ear, Manning marveled at how much has changed since last year when he stood in the victorious visitors locker room after the Panthers' 29-21 divisional playoff victory against the Bears.
20086	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been a whirlwind," he said.
20087	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Confronting his legal issues was just part of it.
20088	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After taking stock of his life, Manning broke up with his fianc?e, married a woman from his hometown, Fresno, Calif., whom he had been friends with for years, and became a father.
20089	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His son, Ricky III, was born on Nov. 14.
20090	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"The last nine months has been a drastic change for me," Manning said.
20091	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It has been crazy."
20092	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.
20093	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I'm smiling.
20094	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I've got a kid.
20095	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm married to a beautiful lady.
20096	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Because of the trouble I got in, that's why my life has changed, but I like the change."
20097	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning used part of the signing bonus he received from the Bears to buy a Bentley, but it does not get much of a workout.
20098	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His circumstances have caused him to become a homebody.
20099	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't go out anymore," he said.
20100	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I don't do anything."
20101	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A gun enthusiast, Manning said he no longer frequents the firing range.
20102	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He has given his guns to friends and relatives until his probation is over.
20103	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He sends his regrets when he is invited to parties.
20104	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I miss some of the guys' parties that they're throwing," Manning said, "but they understand.
20105	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	They know I just can't take that chance of something happening."
20106	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
20107	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
20108	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	For starters, he did not need to be out with a friend at 3 a.m.
20109	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Me being out at 3 o'clock at night and partying and being around people that can take advantage of me is just not a good situation," he said.
20110	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Initially I reacted to getting disrespected when I thought I shouldn't have been," he added.
20111	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"OK, I shouldn't have done that.
20112	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But I thought I had done the right thing by walking away, by leaving."
20113	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he was arrested nonetheless and his public image took a brutal hit.
20114	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"It was tough, knowing that what happened gives people a misconception of me," Manning said.
20115	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He added, "It took for that to happen for me to learn."
20116	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Since April, Manning has joined the Bears' family and created a family of his own.
20117	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He keeps his relatives closer, having come to the conclusion that they are the best company because they will not lead him astray.
20118	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He flew in some cousins for the game Sunday, some of whom had never traveled by airplane before.
20119	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.
20120	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In his arms, he was cradling his sleeping son.
20121	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning walked past a makeshift TV studio where Gould was being interviewed about his game-winning field goal.
20122	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A dozen fans, many of them holding camera phones as if they were lighters at a concert, had gathered to pay homage to Gould and were blocking the exit.
20123	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	A security guard cleared a path for Manning, who slipped through as cleanly as a knife through a perfectly baked cake.
20124	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Not a single fan stuck to him.
20125	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.

20129	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	MIDEAST HAWKS HELP TO DEVELOP GIULIANI POLICY
20130	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
20131	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
20132	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Their positions have been criticized by Democrats as irresponsible and applauded by some conservatives as appropriately tough, while raising questions about how closely aligned Giuliani's thinking is with theirs.
20133	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
20136	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
20137	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Based on his public statements, Giuliani does not share all of their views and parts company with traditional neoconservative thinking in some respects.
20138	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
20139	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the next president will confront and is still meeting for the first time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on particular subjects.
20141	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among some Democrats.
20142	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Podhoretz said in an interview published Wednesday in the New York Observer that he recently met with Giuliani to discuss his new book, in which he advocates bombing Iran as part of a larger struggle against "Islamofascism," and "there is very little difference in how he sees the war and I see it."
20144	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I mean, here's a guy making statements about Iran that, if he means them, guarantee there is no option but a war," Biden said in a recent interview.
20145	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
20146	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
20147	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Yes.
20148	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
20149	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
20151	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
20153	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Elections are necessary but not sufficient to establish genuine democracy," Giuliani wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs, the policy journal.
20154	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their neighbors."
20155	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
20157	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign policy."
20158	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings, contains a number of main elements.
20159	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
20160	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
20161	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to emphasize trade over aid.
20162	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
20164	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with unfriendly countries.
20165	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
20167	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he said.
20168	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"You've got to know with whom to negotiate and with whom you should not negotiate."
20169	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
20171	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.
20173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
20175	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Just days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hill joined a number of prominent foreign policy experts in signing an open letter to Bush urging that "even if evidence does not link Iraq directly to the attack, any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
20176	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."
20177	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He sometimes faults Democrats for failing to mention that the terrorist threat comes specifically from Muslims.
20179	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"America shouldn't be even-handed in dealing with the difference between an elected democracy that's a government ruled by law, and a group of terrorists," he said.
20180	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"I think that was part of the mistake of the 1990s that led to the debacle that we saw in the Middle East in the way Clinton was handling it."
20181	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Neteller founder pleads guilty in online gambling case in New York
20183	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The co-founder of Neteller, a company based in Britain that processed billions of dollars in Internet gambling transactions for Americans, has pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal conspiracy.
20184	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Lawrence, whose company, Neteller PLC, was once one of the primary ways U.S. citizens placed bets with offshore bookies, acknowledged in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that the operation was illegal.
20185	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"I came to understand that providing payment services to online gambling Web sites serving customers in the United States was wrong," he told the judge Friday.
20186	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	His lawyers said he was cooperating with U.S. investigators and also had agreed to be at least partly responsible for the $100 million (euro74.05 million) the government is seeking in restitution.
20187	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and another Neteller director, John David Lefebvre, were arrested in January as part of a U.S. crackdown on the online gambling industry.
20189	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Their company was based in the Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
20190	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Some experts initially believed that Neteller's offshore status put it beyond the reach of U.S. law.
20191	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The company also was not directly involved in either placing or receiving bets.
20192	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It essentially served as a financial middleman, through which bettors could send and receive cash from Web-based operations located in countries with few restrictions on gambling.
20193	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors read U.S. law differently, and charged Lawrence with violating decades-old acts prohibiting the use of electronic wires to send or receive information that facilitates illegal gambling.
20194	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, who remains free on $5 million (euro3.7 million) bail, declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
20195	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"Mr. Lawrence is very glad to have this episode over and is looking forward to moving on to the next stage in his life," said his attorney, Peter Neiman.
20196	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He said Lawrence intended to return to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been scheduled for October.
20197	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear whether Lawrence will face prison time.
20198	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the case.
20199	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The case against Lefebvre, who pleaded not guilty, is pending.
20201	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1999, the company grew fast as spooked credit card companies, worried about legal liability, stopped doing business with offshore gambling operations.
20202	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors said Neteller processed $5.1 billion worth of transactions in the first half of 2006.
20203	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Nearly all involved online gambling.
20204	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	A majority of the company's revenue came from customers in the U.S., and the FBI began looking at its operations in June 2006.
20205	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, at one point, was the company's largest shareholder.
20206	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Both he and Lefebvre have since left the company's board of directors.
20207	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and Lefebvre are among a group of businessmen linked to online gambling who have faced U.S. charges.
20208	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Kaplan, the founder of the London-based bookmaker BetOnSports PLC, was indicted on racketeering charges in St. Louis.
20210	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The chairman of Sportingbet PLC was detained briefly last year in New York after he was indicted on online gambling charges in Louisiana.
20211	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The U.S. Congress last year also enacted new regulations further barring banks and credit card companies from processing online gambling payments.
20212	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The crackdown has not sat well abroad.

20221	XIN_ENG_20080331.0148.LDC2009T13	But if Ukraine joins the plan, we will take more severe measures," a unnamed protest organizer told reporters.
20222	XIN_ENG_20080331.0148.LDC2009T13	He added that around 9,000 people are expected to take part in the protest from March 31 through April 4.

20230	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	Dramatic increase in size for Gospel Channel after deal
20232	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The Black Family Channel will shut down and has sold its space on cable systems to the Gospel Music Channel, the networks said Tuesday.
20233	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The deal makes the Gospel Music Channel available in America's 10 largest markets, and it expects to finish the year with more than 20 million subscribers, the network said.
20234	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	"Gospel Music Channel embodies BFC's values, but does so on a broader, multicultural scale," said Willie Gary, founder of the Black Family Channel, about the shutdown.
20238	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The top U.S. representative of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group designated as a foreign terrorist organization, orchestrated a covert campaign to finance its escalating conflict with military forces in Sri Lanka, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
20239	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Karunakaran Kandasamy, 50, was ordered held without bail in Brooklyn on charges of providing material support to terrorists.
20240	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
20241	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	In the past several years, the Tamil Tigers group has "covertly operated within the United States, drawing on America's financial resources and technological advances to further its war of terror in Sri Lanka and elsewhere," U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf said in a statement.
20242	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Kandasamy's attorney, Charles Hochbaum, argued that as a "political refugee" and U.S. citizen, his client deserved bail.
20244	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The arrest was the latest attempt by U.S. authorities to cut off support for the group which, according to court papers, has engaged "in terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings and political assassinations," while fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation's north and east.
20245	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Last year, its emissaries were charged in Brooklyn with conspiring to buy surface-to-air missiles.
20246	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors also alleged the defendants tried to bribe U.S. officials to remove the group from the terrorism list.
20247	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	A defense attorney for one of those defendants said the charges would be vigorously contested.
20248	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	An FBI raid on Kandasamy's office in Queens unearthed evidence that he raised millions of dollars for the Tamil Tigers through a front organization called the World Tamil Coordinating Committee, the court papers said.
20249	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	He took orders from rebel leaders in Sri Lanka, in South Asia, and arranged meetings there with supporters "with backgrounds in engineering, technology, weaponry, medicine and scientific fields," the papers said.
20251	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The civil war killed at least 65,000 people before a Norwegian- brokered cease-fire was signed in 2002.
20252	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The truce temporarily halted the fighting, but more than 4,000 people have died since late 2005, when violence flared again.
20253	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Violence has increased recently in Sri Lanka as the government pushes to retake rebel-held territory in the east.
20254	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The rebels have struck back with bombings, their first-ever air raid on a government air force base and several attacks at sea.

20262	NYT_ENG_20080411.0125.LDC2009T13	AIRLINES-MISERY (Undated) -- Looking at the twin strains on the airline industry's maintenance challenges.

20291	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
20294	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
20297	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and radicalization across the region.
20298	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.
20301	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.
20302	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice met another of the group's main recommendations Thursday when she named a "czar" to oversee a new, more decentralised push for economic reconstruction and job creation in Iraq.
20304	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	But at the same time, Bush's top diplomat made clear that diplomacy involving Syria and Iran remained out of the question.
20305	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over neighboring Lebanon.
20306	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"That's not diplomacy, that's extortion," she said.

20315	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that rule," he said.
20316	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Later, during an appearance at a Greater Houston Partnership luncheon, Alvarez was asked what Chavez wants to hear from the new U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.
20317	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We are ready to respect Venezuela," Alvarez replied.
20319	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez is spending several days in Texas on a visit he said has focused more on making community contacts than on the energy business, though he conceded that it's "impossible to have a completely non-oil visit to Texas."
20321	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
20323	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	In May, Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took over operations of major oil projects that had been run by Houston-based ConocoPhillips, Irving-based Exxon Mobil, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp. and Paris-based Total.
20325	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.
20327	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	PDVSA absorbed their stakes, and the companies are negotiating compensation for what they gave up.
20328	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chevron and Total agreed to stay on as PDVSA's minority partners.
20330	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Analysts have valued the combined projects PDVSA took over at $25 billion to $30 billion.
20332	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
20333	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said in the meeting with the Chronicle that he isn't worried that the takeovers will chill future investment or participation from foreign companies.
20335	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	This week PDVSA announced that Venezuela and Iran will collaborate to spend $4 billion on a joint Orinoco project.
20336	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and Hispanics.
20337	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
20339	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts could change in midstream.
20340	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, he said questions loom as to whether other companies have the know-how to successfully develop heavy oil projects and maximize production in the Orinoco, where estimated reserves could surpass those in Saudi Arabia.
20341	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.
20342	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"I think the government will have to recalibrate and re-evaluate its prospects unless it wants to run the risk of either pushing other companies out or failing to convince any new companies to step in."
20344	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	That could prompt oil service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
20345	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
20347	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility.
20348	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
20349	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.
20350	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He also said that during his visit, he would meet privately with officials of Chevron and Citgo.
20351	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He had no meetings scheduled with ConocoPhillips or Exxon Mobil.
20352	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan says 2Q sales grow, MS drug to become US$1 billion `blockbuster ' soon
20354	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp.
20355	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	PLC. reported narrowing second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
20356	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Revenues rose 30 percent to US$245.6 million (euro156.6 million) in the April-June quarter, chiefly because of Tysabri, which is produced and distributed in alliance with U.S. drugmaker Biogen Idec Inc.
20357	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan cut its losses nearly in half to US$71.5 million (euro45.6 million), compared to a US$141.1 million loss in the second quarter of 2007.
20358	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Executives said they hoped to report narrower full-year losses and a 2009 return to profit -- which would be Elan's first since the company nearly went bankrupt amid an accounting scandal in 2002.
20360	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
20362	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	It's a strong turnaround from 2005, when Elan faced potential financial ruin over the surprise withdrawal of Tysabri.
20363	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Three clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called PML, and two died.
20364	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
20365	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.
20366	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The three PML victims were simultaneously taking another MS-fighting drug
20367	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.
20368	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The further we go (without any new PML cases), the more comfortable that people become and the more that patients demand to be put on Tysabri," Cooke said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
20369	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
20370	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He said close to 7 percent were already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20 percent would be.
20371	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
20373	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the drug today.
20374	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan's spending on research and development increased 36 percent to US$81.2 million (euro51.8 million), chiefly reflecting efforts to produce treatments and a potential cure for the brain- destroying Alzheimer's disease.
20375	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan and its research partner, Wyeth, plan to present second- phase results for one potential Alzheimer's treatment, bapineuzumab, at a Chicago conference for neurologists Tuesday.
20376	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical trials.
20378	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The Alzheimer's need is, unfortunately, immense," Martin said.
20379	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"It is probably the largest single market that's as yet untapped by the biopharmaceutical industry."
20381	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan shares suffered their biggest drop in seven months Thursday, closing down 8.8 percent at euro20.12 (US$31.49).

20389	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg, whose second term ends in 2009, is barred by law from running for re-election.
20390	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
20391	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In his appearance on Thursday, Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader and the founder of a billion-dollar financial data firm, will argue that the worldwide financial crisis -- and its potentially severe impact on New York City -- demands his steady hand and business experience.
20392	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
20393	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
20394	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the council.
20395	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	His staff is drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two.
20396	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But the measure would require voter approval for the change to become permanent, these people said.
20397	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk.
20398	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
20399	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996.
20400	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
20401	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"Democracy," he added, "is bigger than any one person."
20402	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
20403	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes.
20404	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call for abolishing term limits.
20405	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The New York Post and the New York Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
20406	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
20407	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
20409	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
20410	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor," said the person who has advised the mayor in the past.
20411	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"It's not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it."
20412	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
20413	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
20414	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several have told the mayor, who prizes loyalty, that they may not remain for a full third term.
20415	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
20416	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
20417	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
20419	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
20421	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This is a good time for him to do this.
20422	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People are scared."
20423	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
20424	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
20425	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Now, he added, "I could support the idea of a third term."
20426	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Lauder's change of heart was reported on Tuesday in the New York Post.
20428	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term- limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two- thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- a third term.
20429	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
20430	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.
20431	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's change of heart is certain to cause chaos in the city's political class.
20433	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But if the mayor succeeds in revising the law, all of those candidates can seek a third term in their current offices.
20436	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
20437	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
20438	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"While Mike Bloomberg will undoubtedly have some opposition -- there will be somebody -- I expect him to be overwhelming re-elected."
20439	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Rep. Anthony D. Weiner, a likely mayoral candidate, said through a spokesman that "It's illegal to run for a third term."
20440	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
20441	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be used against him in the next mayoral campaign.

20467	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The United States returned the tattooed head of a Maori and bones from 13 others to New Zealand on Monday -- the latest repatriation of indigenous remains from overseas museums, a Maori expert said.
20468	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	"The ancestors were welcomed back on to Te Papa's marae (National Museum meeting place)" and placed in a sacred area with scores of other returned remains, said Arapata Hakiwai, director of Maori treasures at Wellington's Te Papa National Museum.
20470	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	"For all of us a very emotional time to be returning at last the (remains) to New Zealand," Field Museum Curator of Pacific anthropology John Terrell told The Associated Press.
20471	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The Chicago museum bought the bones in 1893 from a scientific supply house in New York.
20472	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Researchers once used them to compare the features of different native peoples.
20473	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Hakiwai, one of the group that accompanied the remains from the Field Museum, said the museum had "made the right decision on the right grounds -- it was the right thing to do."
20474	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	The Field Museum one of the first major U.S. museums to return Maori remains, which will now be part of ongoing research to try to determine which tribal area they originated from in the 19th century.
20475	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	They were collected when Maoris offered mummified heads and other remains of mainly slaves in grisly exchanges for guns and other goods.
20476	APW_ENG_20070910.0314.LDC2009T13	Hakiwai said his museum had acquired repatriated Maori remains from more than 30 institutions worldwide since 2003.

20499	XIN_ENG_20080417.0353.LDC2009T13	But in case an incident did occur, he said he would do everything he could to protect the torch.

20572	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
20573	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	For Western Kentucky (29-7), the lopsided loss ends a dazzling season that saw the Hilltoppers storm through the Sun Belt tournament and into America's consciousness when Ty Rogers' 3-point heave topped Drake in overtime in the first round.
20574	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
20575	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-8 sophomore forward James Keefe finished with 18 points.
20576	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Keefe's career high coming into the game was eight.
20577	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Kevin Love scored a career-high 29 points and added 14 rebounds.
20578	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But UCLA struggled mightily in the second half against the Hilltoppers' full-court pressure, which allowed Western Kentucky to creep within four points and perpetuate UCLA's reputation as a team that can always make a game close.
20579	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That's something that could haunt the Bruins as they advance.
20580	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky cut the UCLA lead to 61-57 with less than seven minutes remaining when Tyrone Brazelton blew past Darren Collison for a layup.
20581	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The basket capped a personal 8-0 run by Brazelton.
20582	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA answered with a basket from Love and UCLA ended any notion of a threat when Josh Shipp hit a line drive 3-point shot with 4 minutes 33 seconds remaining to spread the lead back out to 68-59.
20583	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA held Western Kentucky to 18.8 percent shooting in the first half and 34.7 for the game.
20584	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins built their halftime lead with inside dominators.
20585	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Love had 15 first-half points while Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for seven points in 10 minutes.
20586	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up, leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in anticipation of their game against Xavier.
20587	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That game will be an intriguing matchup.
20589	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	And those are only the ones from outside the Atlantic 10.
20590	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut defense.
20591	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked No. 5 nationally in scoring defense.
20592	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins yield only 58 points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
20593	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is the erratic play of Collison, the point guard.
20594	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He fouled out with four points.
20595	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He turned the ball over four times and had only one assist in the Round of 32 against Texas A&amp

20597	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	M, a narrow Bruins victory.
20598	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.

20604	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua)
20605	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	With world bullion prices hitting new highs, gold futures made a strong debut on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) on Wednesday.
20606	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract offers China a chance to become a key player in the global gold market.
20607	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It could also be a hedging tool for gold producers and a means to absorb excess liquidity, analysts said.
20608	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The key contract for June delivery was the first to take off, surging 9.98 percent to 230.95 yuan (about 31.65 U.S. dollars) per gram.
20609	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	This was followed by the daily limit rise of other contracts for July-to-December delivery.
20610	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Seven contracts were traded, with the benchmark price set at 209.99 yuan per gram by the SFE a day earlier, lower than world prices.
20611	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract size was set at 1,000 grams, larger than the originally expected 300 grams, to discourage individual investors who lacked the ability to handle the risk.
20612	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Analysts said they believed investors would need at least 24,000 yuan to secure a futures contract, as most futures brokers would ask for a 12 percent cash deposit for each contract.
20613	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The most active June contract closed the first trading day at 223.3 yuan per gram, up 6.34 percent, with a turnover of 23.2 billion yuan, according to the SFE website.
20614	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The total turnover of the seven contracts was registered at more than 27 billion yuan for the day.
20615	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	All futures contracts finished the day higher, between 223 yuan and 228 yuan, slipping slightly after peaking at 230.99 yuan.
20616	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.
20617	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Global prices jumped more than 30 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979.
20618	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold prices climbed more than 2 percent on Tuesday against strong oil prices and a weakening U.S. currency.
20619	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	A troy ounce of gold for February delivery added 18.3 U.S. dollars to settle at 880.30 U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
20620	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the launch of gold futures trading.
20621	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
20622	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE, one of China's major futures trading venues, previously traded copper, aluminum, zinc, natural rubber and fuel futures.
20623	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said that gold futures could provide experience for the long- awaited launch of stock index futures.
20624	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Live pig futures will also be launched to help stabilize pork prices.
20625	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	HEDGING PRICES VS INVESTMENT TOOLS
20627	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said gold futures would improve the country's domestic gold market and pricing mechanism and provide options for financial institutions, gold producers and consumers to protect against market risk.
20628	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also further develop the nascent futures industry.
20631	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	She said, "the contract size could limit participation by individual investors, but in the long run both institutions and individuals would play an equal role."
20633	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.
20634	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, "I would first offer risk education to veteran stock investors, since even they lacked the experience for riskier futures trading," Zhao told Xinhua.
20636	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, the regulators were trying to discourage such clients, fearing that some might take on risks they couldn't handle.
20637	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE said earlier that it would impose strict risk controls on gold futures.
20638	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also set a minimum margin requirement of 7 percent of the contract value.
20639	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
20640	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, CSRC said individuals would be barred from taking physical delivery of gold in futures trading and could buy bullion only from banks or the spot market.
20641	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	RISING STAR IN WORLD MARKET?
20643	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zheng Xueqin, a Chicago Board Options Exchange senior counselor, agreed that "Shanghai could emerge as the third center of world gold trade, after New York and London."
20645	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Hong Kong and Tokyo were two major Asian trading centers.
20646	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Domestic analysts expressed confidence about the contract's prospects, citing robust investment registered in simulated trade between Jan. 2-8.
20647	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China was the world's third largest gold producer in 2006 after South Africa and the United States.
20648	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold consumption by the country's manufacturing sector was about 9.2 percent of the global total, according to official data.

20652	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said that the new futures market could thus help the country's tighter monetary policy and alleviate inflation pressure.
20653	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Trade at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the country's spot market, was 1,828 tons last year, with a total value of 316.5 billion yuan.
20654	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Based on that figure, Zheng said, the futures market could hit 10.5 trillion yuan, because international experience showed that futures trade was usually 33 times spot trade.
20655	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The estimated figure would exceed the combined market capitalization of the country's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

20661	APW_ENG_20070223.1663.LDC2009T13	The company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones Newswires and other publications, disclosed in a regulatory filing that Kann had received 42,704 shares of Dow Jones stock under an incentive program.
20662	APW_ENG_20070223.1663.LDC2009T13	Dow Jones announced on Wednesday that its board expects to elect independent director Peter McPherson as the company's next chairman at its next shareholder meeting in April.
20663	APW_ENG_20070223.1663.LDC2009T13	Kann, who is 64, had previously also served as the company's chief executive from 1991 until Feb. 1 of last year, when he was succeeded by Richard Zannino.
20664	APW_ENG_20070223.1663.LDC2009T13	The company had previously announced his plans to retire.
20670	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"I urge members of Congress to listen to what (Petraeus and Crocker) have to say," he said, against a backdrop of two military Humvees spotlit in the gathering night.
20676	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he sees as improved security.
20677	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"So the issue is are we at the point where we can continue to make security progress with X number of forces?"
20678	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said.
20679	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
20680	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003.
20683	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
20684	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Those decisions will be based on a calm assessment by our military commanders on the conditions on the ground, not a nervous reaction by Washington politicians to poll results in the media," the president said.
20685	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
20686	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
20687	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Gates said the general view was that security has improved not just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of the surge.
20688	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some (areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape," Gates told reporters.
20689	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But security officials said that shortly before Bush's arrival, two car bombs went off in Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi, killing four people and wounding 10.
20690	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, police found 15 corpses of men shot dead.

20703	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar climbed to eight-week highs against the euro and seven-month highs against the yen Wednesday as fears of a global slowdown helped the dollar continue its rally.
20706	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The dollar gained as gloomy economic signs came in from abroad.
20709	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Orders dropped 2.9 percent in June, following a 1.4 percent drop in May, the Economy Ministry said.

20713	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	"The ECB and Bank of England don't have much to cheer about."
20714	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The ECB is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25 percent, given the 4.1 percent inflation in the 15-nation euro zone, while the BoE is expected to keep its rate steady as well, at 5 percent.
20715	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve left the benchmark U.S. federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent on Tuesday.
20716	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Before rising inflation forced a pause in June, the Fed had cut rates seven times since the fall in hopes of reviving the flagging U.S. economy.
20717	APW_ENG_20080806.1271.LDC2009T13	Talk of the Fed hiking rates had driven the dollar higher over the past three weeks, but Tuesday's announcement hinted that a weak economy was still a risk, and many analysts talked down the chance of a rate hike.

20730	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers say they are determined to end their agonizing playoff drought.
20731	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	But some observers think the Panthers haven't exhibited enough determination to reach the post-season for the first time since April 2000.
20732	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	To put it more bluntly, some critics think they are soft.
20733	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"This team plays too much on the perimeter
20734	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I haven't seen the willingness to get their noses dirty and do the dirty work," said NHL broadcaster John Vanbiesbrouck, who starred in the nets for the Panthers when they reached the Stanley Cup Final in 1996.
20735	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Winning isn't easy.
20736	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You've got to make up your mind you're going to do whatever it takes to get there and play like that every night."
20737	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have done that only intermittently during the first 51 games.
20738	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Despite their uneven play - they have won only four of their past 14 games - they are only three points out of the Southeast Division lead and five out of eighth place.

20744	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Echoing Vanbiesbrouck's sentiments, Green said the Panthers "lack grittiness."

20746	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	it's more banging in the corners, knocking people off pucks, imposing themselves on their opponents," Green said.
20747	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They won't make it if they don't find a way to get that."
20748	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	A couple of key statistics support Green's assessment: The Panthers are 7-19-2 when the opponent scores first and 4-13-1 when trailing after the first period.
20749	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"The games they've won they've had the lead from the first period on," Panthers announcer Denis Potvin said.
20750	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"They've got to be winning third periods.
20751	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	You can go into the third period down by one or two and still win that period.
20752	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	(They) haven't been winning that period."
20753	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	The Panthers have been outscored 61-47 in the final 20 minutes.
20754	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Vanbiesbrouck said he also has been disappointed by the production of several secondary scorers, most notably Nathan Horton (12 goals, 26 assists) and Stephen Weiss (9 goals, 20 assists).
20755	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While they rank second and third on the team in points, neither has had the breakout year many expected.
20756	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score," Vanbiesbrouck said.
20757	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Weiss said: "I want to have more points.
20758	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	It's not for lack of chances.
20759	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I just have to bear down in the crease area, make sure pucks are going in the net."
20760	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"You've got to have two lines scoring," Potvin said.
20761	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One could make the argument that when the Jokinen line was going the Weiss line was not, or the Weiss line was going and the Jokinen line wasn't.
20762	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	One line just isn't enough."
20763	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	While David Booth's 14 goals have given the Weiss line a boost, Jokinen hasn't gotten that kind of help from any of his wingers.
20764	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Potvin also said players have to take it upon themselves to stop being whistled for untimely penalties.
20766	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Several players conceded that the team is maddeningly inconsistent.
20767	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Early, late, or sometimes in the middle of games, a loss of focus will prompt a salvo of opposition shots that often as not overwhelm goalie Tomas Vokoun.
20768	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some games we're slower at the beginning, then pick it up," defenseman Ruslan Salei said.
20769	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"Some we play well from the beginning.
20770	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	I can't give an answer why."
20771	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	Jokinen also is perplexed.
20772	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"One night it's there, the next it isn't," he said.
20773	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"It's 31 games now.
20774	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	We have to make up our mind
20775	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	we really have to buy into this or we're just going to waste another year."
20776	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	If that happens and Columbus makes the playoffs - the Blue Jackets returned from the break tied for eighth in the West - the Panthers would become the only team in the league to fail to reach the post-season since 2000.
20778	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"We've got to play dirty hockey, we've got to play hard every night, and there's no time for a letdown," forward Radek Dvorak said.

20837	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	New Mortgage Rule Aims to Close an Interest Rate Gap
20838	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
20839	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37, a legal secretary.
20840	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
20841	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
20843	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
20844	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rattled investors stopped buying them.
20845	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
20846	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
20847	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 for single-family homes.
20848	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
20849	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The amount would vary so that the most expensive areas would qualify for bigger loans.
20850	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
20851	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
20852	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
20853	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the only ones investors are buying these days, which is why policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
20854	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
20855	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
20857	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	A lot of the details have not yet been determined.
20858	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
20859	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
20860	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of calculating the limits
20861	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	it's expected to tell lenders next month what the limits are in various areas.
20862	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
20863	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
20864	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts.
20865	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of the region they will use.
20866	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the Stanford Group Company, a policy research firm in Washington, estimated that if the cap is based on median prices compiled by the National Association of Realtors, locally it would be about $500,000 and would apply to an area that extends into West Virginia.
20868	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
20869	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lower rates would help Galloway, the Charles County homeowner.
20870	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
20871	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She has an adjustable-rate mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly to a higher level.
20872	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
20873	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
20874	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
20875	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
20876	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
20877	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
20878	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
20880	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The perceived risk is not a creditworthiness issue, Rajadhyaksha said.
20881	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rather, it's the jumbo borrowers' well-documented fondness for refinancing when rates drop, which forces investors to reinvest the money at a lower rate.
20882	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
20883	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
20884	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75.
20885	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."
20886	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
20887	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But even if rates drop, not everyone will be able to take advantage of them, Retsinas said.
20888	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

20988	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Wayne Rooney, twice, and Carlos Tevez were the players to benefit from the winger's service in a game that confirmed the scale of the task facing Arsenal and Chelsea if they are to overhaul the reigning champions.
20989	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	This was the perfect response to Arsenal's impressively resilient victory at Bolton earlier in the day that appeared to revive the London club title claims.
20990	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That win meant United kicked off just three points ahead of Arsene Wenger's side and, with Chelsea set to face Middlesbrough the following day, anything less than three points would have given the three-way battle at the head of the table a new twist.
20991	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	As it was Ferguson's side didn't just get the job done, they triumphed in a style that will undoubtedly suggested there is little chance of them throwing away such a commanding lead at this stage of the season.
20993	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
20994	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But from the moment Ronaldo produced an impudent back-heel flick from ten yards out to divert the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and beyond Scott Carson for the 17th minute opener, United were almost completely in control.
20995	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed home.
20996	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	Villa already looked a beaten side but they did at least rally after half-time, applying a brief period of pressure and, after Rooney had missed a sitter at the other end, should have scored when substitute Shaun Maloney pulled the ball wide when clear on Tomasz Kuzsczak's goal.
20997	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
20998	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60 seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.

21107	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua)
21108	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	Montenegro on Monday joined the European Union (EU)'s Competitiveness and Innovation Program (CIP), following the footsteps of three fellow candidate and potential candidate countries aspiring to join the EU.
21109	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	Croatia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia joined the CIP in October 2007, while Turkey did so in February this year.
21111	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	European Commissioner Gunter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, said Montenegro's joining the CIP "confirms its European aspirations."
21112	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	"Participation in CIP, and, in particular the cooperation in the new Enterprise Europe Network, which Montenegro has already successfully entered, will help Montenegro to increase the competitiveness of its enterprises, in particular SMEs," he added.
21113	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	According to the European Commission, the possibility of participating in a host of joint projects and in Enterprise Europe Network with the 27 EU member states is a substantial advantage for Montenegro.
21114	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	It will allow the country to take full benefit of best practices on entrepreneurship, SMEs policy, competitiveness and innovation in the EU.
21118	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	The CIP, which runs from 2007 to 2013 with a budget of 3.6 billion euros (some 5.4 billion U.S. dollars), contains the following three pillars.
21119	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	-- Entrepreneurship and Innovation Framework Program (EIP): EIP fosters the competitiveness of enterprises for example by providing co-guarantees and co- investments for local banks and risk capital funds so that they can improve access for SMEs to loan and venture capital finance.
21120	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	EIP also supports providers of business and innovation services in all EU regions or helps to link innovation actors and clusters in European networks.
21121	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	-- Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Program (ICTPSP): ICTPSP accelerates the development of a sustainable, competitive, innovative and inclusive information society stimulating a wider adoption and more efficient take up and better use of information and communication technologies.
21122	XIN_ENG_20080303.0273.LDC2009T13	-- Intelligent Energy-Europe Program (IEE): IEE promotes energy efficiency and new and renewable energy sources in all sectors including transport.

21128	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Separately, an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire reached on Saturday appeared to take hold in Gaza, after a week of fierce factional fighting between Fatah and its rival, Hamas.
21130	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said that the dead included seven members of Hayya's family, including three of his brothers, and a neighbor.

21146	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	More than 150 rockets have been launched at Israel since Tuesday, according to the army.
21148	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	The government's announcement on Sunday angered many Sderot residents, who said the action did not go far enough, Many were hoping that Olmert would order a re-invasion of the Gaza Strip, from which Israel withdrew in 2005, and some took to the streets in protest.

21159	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	In Gaza City, schools, stores and businesses reopened Sunday and people resumed their lives after a week of self-imposed curfew because of the clashes.
21160	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	But the atmosphere remained tense between Fatah and Hamas, which share power in a unity government that has come under strain.

21166	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Many local residents who witnessed the factional fighting said that the Islamist forces of Hamas appeared to be the more dedicated fighters, attributing that to their religious conviction.
21169	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Fighel said that Israel still has not found a good technological answer to the primitive rockets from Gaza, and that the current military action, consisting of air strikes and some tank shelling, had been "more of the same, and ineffective."
21170	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Hamas is still highly motivated, he added, suggesting that Israel should "hit the Palestinians in a different dimension, to restore deterrence."
21171	NYT_ENG_20070520.0148.LDC2009T13	Israel, he said, had other options like cutting off electricity and water supplies to Gaza and killing high-ranking Hamas members, "including ministers."
21172	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Is Wall Street meltdown moment of truth in White House race?
21173	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	It took a real-world crisis to wrench the White House race away from lipstick and pigs, with the Wall Street meltdown offering a sudden chance of a breakout moment for Barack Obama or John McCain.
21174	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	After feuding all year over who could best handle a "3 am" call in the White House, the candidates faced a real judgment call when iconic investment bank Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, sparking global stocks contagion.
21178	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Their focus on issues issue contrasted with last week's gutter politics which included the McCain camp accusing Obama of insulting Republican vice presidential pick Sarah Palin, in a distortion of his use of the phrase "lipstick on a pig."
21179	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama Monday immediately blamed eight years of Republican rule for the crisis, and predicted McCain would bring four more years of the same.
21180	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	His Republican rival promised a regulatory reform drive in Wall Street, and said Obama would hike taxes and thwart economic growth.
21181	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	But the Arizona Senator, who now leads his rival by a few points in national polls, opened himself up by declaring in Florida that the fundamentals of the economy were "strong."
21183	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama asked at a campaign event in Colorado, as his supporters immediately branded McCain as out of touch and the inheritor to the Bush administration's economic legacy.
21184	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the campaign Obama tried to capitalize on a comment by McCain that he did not know as much about the economy as he should.
21186	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama and the Democrats seem yet to have reached the levels of empathy with hard-pressed voters achieved by his primary rival Hillary Clinton, or famously by her husband Bill Clinton in the 1992 campaign.
21187	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"It is amazing that they have not been able to do that to this point," said Dowdle.
21188	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	An ABC News/Washington Post poll earlier this month found 47 percent of voters trusted Obama to run the economy and 42 percent trusted McCain.
21189	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	The Democrat had enjoyed a much wider lead on the issue for much of this year.
21190	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain has struggled to navigate away from Bush economic legacy, and Democrats argue that his economic policies barely differ from those of the current president.
21194	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama's short career as a public servant has been defined by pessimism, defeatism and weakness in the face of the great challenges of our time," he said.
21197	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	McCain is expected to press home that argument against Obama in three potentially decisive presidential debates beginning on September 26.
21198	AFP_ENG_20080916.0850.LDC2009T13	Obama supporters will see the forums as his best chance to finally thrust home a winning message on the economy.

21288	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Omitted from the McHenry plea for fairness was the fact that the GOP had ignored Pelosi's 2004 request -- while routinely engaging in the procedural maneuvers that Pelosi's plan would have corrected.
21289	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Was the gentleman from North Carolina asking Democrats to do as he says, not as he did?
21290	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Look, I'm a junior member,'' young McHenry protested.
21291	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not beholden to what former congresses did.''
21292	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Anne Kornblut of the New York Times asked McHenry if his complaint might come across as whining.
21293	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm not whining,'' he whined.
21294	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Even before officially relinquishing majority status today when the 110th Congress convenes, Republicans were protesting the Democrats' heavy-handed leadership.
21295	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But Republicans expecting Democrats to rule the House with an iron fist are likely to be pleasantly surprised: The incoming majority was having enough trouble keeping its own supporters in line.
21297	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Just after Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., vowed, ``We're gonna cut the interest rate in half for student loans,'' hecklers began to chant ``De-escalate!
21298	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Investigate!
21299	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Troops home now!''
21300	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``That is exactly what we're talking about,'' Emanuel said, trying to appease the protesters.
21301	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	But the hecklers kept chanting, and he fled.
21302	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The Democratic leaders in retreat, Sheehan seized the microphone.
21303	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We put them back in power,'' she said of the Democrats.
21305	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	And they're not requests -- they're demands.''
21306	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	If Wednesday was any indication, the 110th Congress will be highly entertaining, if not terribly productive.
21307	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	So far, it's hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
21309	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	At 32, he is a year older than McHenry, and several inches taller, but no less outraged by Democrats' refusal to bestow on Republicans the rights that Republicans refused to bestow on Democrats.
21310	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We are disappointed,'' protested Putnam, whose fair skin was covered with a layer of makeup.
21311	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``We're clearly disappointed,'' seconded Roy Blunt of Missouri.
21312	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I'm disappointed, as are some others,'' added Kay Granger of Texas.
21313	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``I am very disappointed,'' concurred David Dreier of California.
21314	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It fell to CNN's Dana Bash to point out the awkward truth.
21315	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``You can play back, almost verbatim, Democrats ... saying almost exactly what you all just said,'' she said.
21316	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``So is there a little bit of hypocrisy in you saying that you want minority rights?''
21317	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``This is a missed opportunity to really change the way that the House does business,'' Putnam offered, citing Democrats' campaign promises for ``a new way of doing business.''
21318	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What stopped you from taking that opportunity when you were still in the majority?''
21319	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	inquired Rick Klein of the Boston Globe.
21321	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Republicans must have known they'd have some explaining to do, because they scheduled back-to-back news conferences on their minority rights.
21322	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	As soon as the Putnam session ended, Granger took the elevator up three flights and joined McHenry and his cohort in the TV gallery.
21323	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Granger had not updated her talking points.
21324	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``It's very disappointing,'' she said.
21325	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Further disappointment came when the first questioner elicited the confession that none of the lawmakers had previously sympathized with Pelosi's plea for minority rights.
21326	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	McHenry unfurled excuses: ``We were not in Congress.
21327	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... I didn't have the opportunity.
21328	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	... She did not put it in legislative form.''
21329	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	It had all the makings of a PR debacle.
21330	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	Fortunately for McHenry, the Democrats were otherwise engaged.
21331	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	An hour after fleeing the microphone because of Sheehan's heckling, Emanuel and other Democratic leaders returned for another attempt to talk about ethics and the minimum wage.
21332	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``Rahm, would you answer Cindy Sheehan, though?''
21333	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``An hour or so ago you had to stop your remarks because (of) Cindy Sheehan.''
21334	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	``What are Democrats going to do about the war in Iraq?''
21335	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	For the new majority, it must have been, well, disappointing.

21450	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Eurozone finance chiefs warned on Friday that the 15-nation bloc faced growing risks to economic growth and inflation, but insisted there was currently no threat of a recession.
21453	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The US and the eurozone are certainly different in that respect."
21454	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia also acknowledged that "downside risks have increased" since he forecast in February that the eurozone economy would grow 1.8 percent this year.
21455	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, Almunia said eurozone finance ministers expected a "better scenario" than the International Monetary Fund's recently reduced forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year in the bloc.
21456	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	He blamed the bleaker outlook on the current financial crisis, which he said was lasting longer than previously expected.
21457	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	"The longer these tensions will be maintained the greater the risks are the financial market turmoil will be transmitted to the real economy," he said.

21464	AFP_ENG_20080404.0324.LDC2009T13	While the outlook for economic growth was falling, Almunia said inflation was rising and would probably top the 2.6 percent he forecast for 2008 in February.

21473	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Football: Fagan sidelined with broken leg after horror tackle
21474	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Hull City striker Craig Fagan could be out for three months after a dreadful challenge by Newcastle's Danny Guthrie left the forward with a broken leg.
21477	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Fagan left the ground on crutches and Hull confirmed Monday that an X-ray had revealed the 25-year-old former Derby forward had suffered a fractured right tibia, which could keep him out of action for between six weeks and three months.
21478	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	Angry Tigers manager Phil Brown said there was no excuse for Guthrie's tackle, telling the Hull Daily Mail: "It cannot be tolerated, it needs to be kicked out of the game.
21479	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"When you see that the end product is him putting a fellow pro in a cast, it's just not right.
21480	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"That's the horrible side of the game.
21481	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	I don't care what is going on at Newcastle, you cannot tolerate this.
21483	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"In the process of doing that, someone has decided to take the matter into his own hands and lashed out at Craig Fagan."
21484	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	A contrite Guthrie insisted later Monday his challenge had been "totally out of character", telling Newcastle's official website: "I was very upset to hear the news concerning Craig.
21485	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"The club have been in touch with Hull City on my behalf because I want to speak to Craig in person to apologise and wish him a speedy recovery.
21486	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	I hope to be able to do that as soon as possible.
21487	AFP_ENG_20080915.0112.LDC2009T13	"It was a challenge that came purely out of frustration towards the end of Saturday's game, but anybody who knows me will accept it was totally out of character on my part."
21488	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	MICROSOFT ADVERSARY RISES INSTINCTIVELY AT YAHOO BID
21491	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	After all, many industry analysts view the acquisition plan, announced Friday, as a desperation move by Microsoft to buy a bigger stake in the online advertising and Internet search markets, even as it and Yahoo fade further behind Google.
21492	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
21493	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
21494	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His animosity toward Microsoft has long been publicly understated and analytic in quality.
21496	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
21498	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"This looks like the beginning of the formal war."
21499	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
21500	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
21503	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
21504	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's initiative toward Yahoo, according to former colleagues, seems to have set off alarm bells for Schmidt, the seasoned Microsoft adversary.
21506	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"But for Eric, it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door."
21508	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	He is every bit as comfortable talking about software scripting languages as he is discussing corporate strategy.
21509	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior technology -- a common belief in Silicon Valley.
21510	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
21511	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt's concern is that buying Yahoo could put Microsoft in a position to repeat the pattern of the 1990s, when it used its dominance of personal computer software to wrest control of the early Web software markets, like the ones for computer browsers and media players, according to people who have talked with Schmidt recently and asked not to be quoted because they were not authorized to speak for him.
21512	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	If Microsoft buys Yahoo, it will have more than an 80 percent share in markets like consumer e-mail accounts on the Web and instant messaging.
21513	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
21514	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.
21515	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
21516	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
21517	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	They compete not only in Internet searches and advertising, where Google continues to gain market share, but also in software.
21518	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It is an assault that is just getting under way.
21519	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative desktop programs.
21520	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
21521	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"That's the dagger at the heart of Microsoft," said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and an author of the school's case study on Google.
21522	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"And that's why Microsoft is so eager to have a response.
21523	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
21524	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whether Google's concerns about Microsoft are justified is unclear.
21525	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
21526	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The longer Microsoft's purchase of Yahoo can be dragged out with regulatory reviews, they say, the better for Google, as it gains while Microsoft's online business remains unsettled.
21527	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, Google raised concerns about Microsoft's use of the most recent version of its browser to steer users to its MSN search service.
21528	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The browser, which is bundled with Microsoft's Windows operating system, contains a small on-screen box for searching.
21529	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
21530	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft said it listened to concerns from Google and other competitors, and designed the browser so that it was easy to set and change the default search service.
21531	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was not anti-competitive.
21532	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
21533	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
21534	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
21535	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the two powerful companies have different business models that seek proprietary advantage in different places.
21536	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
21537	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Microsoft was found guilty in a federal court," he said.
21538	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The big software maker, he argued, illegally maintained its Windows monopoly by stifling rivals.
21539	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem."
21540	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"At Google," Schmidt added, "we had a long conversation about, if we became a big company, how could we avoid that.
21541	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	There are a lot of technical things we can do and have done.
21542	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data.
21543	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is important because if" you can move your data from Google, you always have a choice to go to a competitor of Google.
21544	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	That is absolutely not true in Microsoft's history."
21545	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google is hoping that Microsoft's past will hamper its effort to become more formidable in the online business.
21546	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.
21550	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Gillian Gibbons, in a dark jacket and blue skirt, was not handcuffed but looked tired as she walked into the courtroom in Khartoum, according to reporters inside, before media were ordered out of the chamber.
21555	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"There is an innocent misunderstanding at the heart of this, not a criminal offense," Miliband told reporters.
21557	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Officials at the Unity High School, a private school where Gibbons teaches, say the teddy bear was part of a class project to teach her 7-year-old pupils about animals.
21558	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	She asked the students to name the bear and they chose the name Muhammad, a common name among Muslim men.
21559	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Each child was allowed to take the bear home on weekends and write a diary about what they did with it.
21560	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	The diary entries were collected in a book with the bear's picture on the cover, labeled, "My Name is Muhammad," according to the school director, Robert Boulos.
21562	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	It was unclear who made the complaint.
21563	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Boulos told media earlier in the week it came from several parents, but on Thursday he told The Associated Press that police informed him it came from a staffer at the school.
21564	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"We hope the case will be dismissed," he said, adding the school could hire private guards to protect Gibbons' when she returned.
21565	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"She is a marvelous teacher, she was even training our other primary teachers."
21570	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He briefly came out to say the proceedings were postponed as the plaintiff had not yet shown up.
21574	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	"When somebody is named Muhammad by his parents and then turns out to be a thief, is it an insult to religion to say, 'That Muhammad is a thief'?
21575	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	Of course not."
21576	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped the trial would be finished Thursday.
21580	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	He denied reports that the school had fired Gibbons.
21583	APW_ENG_20071129.0782.LDC2009T13	But there were signs the case could become a rallying case for Islamic hard-liners.

21628	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	11 charged in connection with credit card fraud
21630	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Eleven people, including a U.S. Secret Service informant, have been charged in connection with the hacking of nine major retailers and the theft and sale of more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
21631	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The data breach is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which said the suspects were charged with conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft.
21633	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The indictment returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston alleges that the suspects hacked into the wireless computer networks of retailers including TJX Cos., BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp
21634	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW and set up programs that captured card numbers, passwords and account information.
21635	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"They used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data, which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves," Attorney General Michael Mukasey said at a news conference.
21636	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"And in total, they caused widespread losses by banks, retailers, and consumers."
21637	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Mukasey called the total dollar amount of the alleged theft "impossible to quantify at this point."
21638	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said that while most of the victims were in the United States, officials still haven't identified all the people who had a card number stolen.
21639	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"I suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised," he said.
21640	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Sullivan said the alleged thieves weren't computer geniuses, just opportunists who used a technique called "wardriving," which involved cruising through different areas with a laptop and looking for accessible wireless Internet signals.
21641	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Once they located a vulnerable network, they installed so-called "sniffer programs" that captured credit and debit card numbers as they moved through a retailer's processing networks.

21643	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The heist was a black eye for retailers like TJX.
21644	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The company initially disclosed the data breach in January 2007 but said a few months later that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to possible fraud in a breach of its computer systems that began in July 2005.
21645	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Court filings by some banks that sued TJX put the number of cards affected at more than 100 million, based on estimates by officials with Visa and MasterCard, who were deposed in the suit.

21650	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	At a press briefing in San Jose, California, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the non-U.S. citizens under indictment were part of an international stolen credit and debit card ring.
21651	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The ring operated in mainly in Eastern Europe, the Phillipines, China and Thailand, and the alleged foreign conspirators remained outside the U.S., Chertoff said.
21652	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The thefts were criminal actions committed for the personal gain of the defendants, who investigators did not consider a national security threat, Chertoff said.
21653	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, their alleged crimes demonstrated the weaknesses of cybersecurity in the U.S.
21654	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Today's indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every American faces in the 21st century -- the fact that each individual's greatest asset is their names, their identity," Chertoff said.
21655	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In the Boston indictment, the alleged ringleader Albert "Segvec" Gonzalez of Miami was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy.
21656	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez, who is in custody in New York, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if he is convicted of all the charges.
21658	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"That was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped," he said.
21659	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	But he said the Secret Service later found out that Gonzalez had also been feeding criminals information about ongoing investigations -- even warning off at least one person.
21660	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, we weren't happy that a person working for us as an informant was double-dealing," Mark Sullivan said.
21662	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	They are charged with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data.
21663	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Yastremskiy was arrested when he traveled to Turkey on vacation in July 2007.
21666	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is in custody awaiting the resolution of extradition proceedings.
21667	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments against Hung-Ming Chiu and Zhi Zhi Wang, both of China, and a person known only by the online nickname "Delpiero" were also unsealed in San Diego.
21668	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	A Justice Department spokeswoman said those three suspects, together with five others, are still at large.
21669	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Officials did not give an arraignment date for Gonzalez.
21670	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	In May, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Yastremskiy, Suvorov and Gonzalez on 27 counts of fraud and identity theft.
21671	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The charges stemmed from allegations that they hacked into a national restaurant chain's computerized cash registers and stole credit card information from customers.

21674	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately possible to reach Yastremskiy, Suvorov and Gonzalez for comment and it was not clear if they have legal representation.

21676	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Associated Press writers Anne D'Innocenzio in New York and Marcus Wohlsen in San Jose, California contributed to this report.
21680	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The military also announced that naval forces destroyed a rebel boat off the coast during a sea battle Thursday, while downplaying reports that the rebels had attacked advancing troops with a chemical weapon.
21681	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	As the fighting intensified in recent months, the rebels have been blamed for a series of deadly attacks on buses, trains and other targets in the capital of Colombo and other towns that have killed scores of civilians far from the war zone.
21682	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities established a maze of roadblocks and checkpoints and continuously changed traffic patterns in Colombo in an effort to prevent new attacks.
21683	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	They have also required all residents of the north to register with the police upon their arrival in the city.
21685	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The order will affect more than 100,000 people who came from the districts of Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaittivu, he said.
21686	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The overwhelming majority of those people are ethnic Tamils.
21687	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"We will not harass people, but we will request, 'Please come,'" Gunasekera said, adding that the exercise was simply an effort by authorities to update their records.
21688	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	He did not say what would happen to those who fail to register.
21689	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Ethnic Tamils living in the capital have complained of frequent police raids, harassment and arbitrary detentions as the fighting between government forces, dominated by the Sinhalese majority, and the Tamil Tigers escalated in recent years.
21690	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Authorities, who hold wide-ranging security powers under emergency regulations renewed by Parliament each month, have long accused rebel sleeper agents of hiding amid Colombo's Tamil community.
21691	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Mano Ganesan, a Tamil lawmaker from Colombo, said there would not be enough time to register everyone in one day and few will be able to produce the required documents from government agents in their faraway home districts.
21692	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Those unable to register will likely be expelled from the city, he said.
21693	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"We will not allow it.
21694	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	We will fight against it, but that is their plan," he said.
21695	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	In new fighting Wednesday, soldiers killed 15 guerrillas in scattered battles in the Vavuniya district bordering the rebels' de facto state, the military said Thursday.
21696	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Other battles along the front lines killed five rebels and seven soldiers, the military said.
21697	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The government previously reported 40 rebels and four soldiers killed in other fighting Wednesday.
21698	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Much of the communication to northern Sri Lanka has been cut, and it was not possible to contact rebel officials for comment.
21699	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The military's figures could not be independently confirmed.
21700	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Each side commonly exaggerates its enemy's casualties and plays down its own.
21701	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	With the Tamil Tigers growing increasingly desperate in the face of a new government offensive, military officials said Thursday that some rebel fighters had attacked troops with CS gas, a form of tear gas.
21703	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	However, a Special Forces soldier in the northern war zone told The Associated Press on Wednesday that a group of soldiers was killed by what appeared to be a burn agent loaded into a shoulder-fired rocket during a battle in the Kilinochchi district Monday.
21704	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The soldier, who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he had seen the bodies, and many were so badly disfigured they had to be buried in closed-caskets funerals.
21705	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	Nanayakkara denied the account, saying that rebels had experimented with using chemical weapons, but had never employed them in battle.
21706	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	"There was no burn agent," he said.
21707	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The rebels have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for Tamils after decades of marginalization by the Sinhalese majority.
21708	APW_ENG_20080918.0478.LDC2009T13	The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people.
21709	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Naples area rubbish crisis deepens
21710	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The rubbish crisis in the Naples area deepened Thursday as two treatment centres complained of paralysis and local authorities announced the upcoming closure of a major dump, an official said.
21711	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Outside the Caivano treatment centre some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the southern city, about 100 trucks were seen waiting to unload their rubbish.
21712	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Another centre that converts rubbish into fuel, located at nearby Giugliano, "is also functioning at a snail's pace", Ilaria Proietti told AFP.
21713	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	She added that one of the area's two main dumps, in Villaricca north of Naples, would close on Saturday because it had reached saturation point.
21714	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The two-week-old crisis has seen some 15,000 tonnes of waste accumulate along roads in the southern province, including nearly 3,000 tonnes in Naples itself, because of a logjam at overstretched treatment and recycling centres, Proietti said Wednesday.
21716	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	New figures were not available Thursday.
21717	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	Provincial authorities have sent text messages to Naples area residents asking them not to burn their waste in a bid to avoid the spread of toxic substances such as dioxin.
21718	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	The chronic problem is the result of a lack of space in existing dumps, some of which have been closed by court injunctions after their operations were taken over by organised crime, dubbed the "ecomafia".
21719	AFP_ENG_20070524.0525.LDC2009T13	A May 10 decree by the centre-left government creating four new dumps -- fiercely opposed by people living nearby -- will not come into effect for several weeks.

21721	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua)
21722	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Major global news media have continued to give prominence to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which closed here on Sunday.
21724	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Jiji said the amendment of the party's constitution showed China is going to adjust its economic-growth-orientated policy, focus on building a harmonious society, pursue a sustainable and stable economic growth, narrow the gap between the rich and poor, better protect the environment and make its people more affluent.
21725	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Kyodo said raising the ratio in competitive elections to over eight percent in the preliminary election of the Central Committee has shown democracy within the party.
21727	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The "scientific outlook on development" values rational thinking.
21728	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	At it's core is putting people first and a basic requirement is balanced and sustainable development, the Yonhap report said.
21729	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This outlook aims to serve the people, to work for their well- being, and calls for development that benefits the people and is based on the notion that the fruits of growth should be shared by all, Yonhap said.
21730	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The outlook would be combined with the theory of building a harmonious society, which strives to solve problems such as the urban-rural gap, the rich-poor gap and unbalanced development and gives priority to environmental protection, Yonhap said.
21731	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Associated Press (AP), Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP) ran updated stories on the election of the new Central Committee and the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC, as well as the conclusion of the congress.
21732	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP said the result will determine how strong the leadership is "as it tries to ease tensions over a wide rich-poor gap at home and manage China's rising clout abroad."
21733	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The AP also reported that a revision to the party's constitution endorses "the scientific outlook on development," calling for increased social spending to help farmers and urban workers whose living standards have not risen as fast as many other Chinese.
21734	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	Reuters said that the "scientific outlook of development" aims to "divert more prosperity to backward villages and poor workers" and to clean up fouled skies and waterways.
21735	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) also reported on the conclusion of the Congress and the insertion of the Scientific Outlook on Development into the party constitution.
21736	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The report cited General Secretary Hu Jintao as saying: "The scientific outlook on development takes development as its essence, putting people first as its core, and comprehensive, balanced and sustainable development as its basic requirement."
21737	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The scientific outlook on development requires China to move towards more sustainable growth and create a "harmonious society" by reducing the economic inequalities that have resulted from the economic developments, the DPA report said.
21738	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	The China Press newspaper, published in the United States, covered at length the closing of the 17th CPC National Congress.
21739	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	An editorial of the paper said people's livelihood has become "the core of China's future development."
21740	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	In Hu's report, China's economic growth was for the first time expressed in per capita terms rather than overall economic growth.
21741	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	This was a sign that the focus of economic growth is not only on strengthening the economy, but more importantly on enriching the whole population and that any development must benefit the general public.
21742	XIN_ENG_20071021.0175.LDC2009T13	"This is a strategic shift in China's outlook on development," the paper said.
21745	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, Sept. 3 (Xinhua)
21747	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"The relief work [so far] is successful," said Wen, on his fourth visit to Sichuan since the quake.
21748	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"Now we are entering a critical stage to boost rehabilitation."
21749	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	With a combination of temporary housing and repaired buildings, about 4.45 million homeless families in the province have found accommodation.
21750	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen visited Zaoshu Village, Qingchuan County, one of the worst- hit areas, as the villagers were busy building or repairing houses.
21751	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	A couple, Shi Guangwu and Zhang Zhengfang, told him that they received a subsidy of 23,000 yuan (3,333 U.S. dollars) from the government to build a new residence.
21752	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Under a provincial government policy issued in June, rural families who lost their homes will build new ones under government supervision.
21753	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Each will receive about 20,000 yuan from the government.
21754	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"I am glad to see farmers in the quake area are busy rebuilding their homes with their own hands.
21755	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	As long as we carefully plan and organize the work, new houses will rise soon," said Wen, who expressed appreciation for their self-reliant attitude.
21756	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	During the four-day trip beginning Sunday, Wen also visited an urban community in Qiaozhuang Town, Qingchuan.
21757	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Permanent home rebuilding has not started in the urban area yet as the government is working on a subsidy policy for urban survivors.
21758	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He explained to the residents that work has to be done to evaluate the condition of damaged houses and develop a rehabilitation plan.
21759	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"As soon as a policy is formulated, rebuilding will start," he said.
21760	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Besides residential buildings, schools and hospitals are priorities in rehabilitation.
21761	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At a temporary hospital in Qingchuan, Wen promised patients that the new hospital would be built soon and medical facilities would be better than before the earthquake.
21762	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The Premier chatted with doctors and nurses from eastern Zhejiang Province who were there helping to serve local residents.
21763	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen thanked them for lending a hand to quake survivors.
21765	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen returned to the school, which is in makeshift buildings, during this visit.
21766	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	More than 240 students in the school were killed in the quake.
21767	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Standing in a classroom before the blackboard, he said to the students: "You are our country's future.
21768	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	I believe beautiful flowers will blossom over the debris of the earthquake."
21769	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Children presented handmade cards to Wen and invited him to take photos with them.
21770	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The Premier presented flowers and bowed three times under the national flag on the campus to mark the victims.
21771	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Agriculture and industry were gradually recovering in the quake area.
21772	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At Yongquan Village in Deyang City, people were harvesting rice and planting potatoes.
21773	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen went into the field, asking farmers about their crop yield.
21774	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Told there was a bumper rice harvest despite the quake, he urged local officials to resume production as soon as possible where conditions allow.
21775	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	At quake-devastated Dongfang Steam Turbine Co., Ltd. of Deyang, which Wen had visited twice previously, he was visibly happy to see production back at the pre-quake level.
21776	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He urged employees to continue working to build the company into a more advanced, secure and sustainable organization.
21777	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The premier also visited a road repair site near the epicenter, Yingxiu, praising the soldiers and workers who braved aftershocks and landslides to keep the road clear after the quake.
21778	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	The worst-hit Beichuan County must be relocated as it was severely damaged in the quake and the original site might be vulnerable.
21779	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Wen again visited the debris where the county seat was once located.
21780	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He trudged on foot for an hour through the debris with a heavy heart.
21781	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He laid a wreath at a mass burial site of quake victims and observed a one- minute silent mourning period together with his entourage.
21782	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told survivor Wang Dan, a 26-year-old woman of Qiang ethnic group, that the pain was overwhelming but the Beichuan people were strong.
21783	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	"Although half of the population perished, the other half -- the survivors -- will build a new Beichuan with hope," he said.
21784	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	When invited by Wang to come again when the new Beichuan is built, Wen promised he would come to the place, which he would remember for life.
21785	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He told local officials that the county should be rebuilt not only materially but also spiritually, as its unique Qiang culture should be preserved and promoted.
21786	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	Presiding over a meeting attended by Sichuan provincial-level officials on Tuesday night, Wen said the quake rescue and relief work had entered an important phase of reconstruction.
21787	XIN_ENG_20080903.0351.LDC2009T13	He urged local governments to seriously implement the reconstruction plan approved by the State Council, the country's Cabinet, and lead local people to accomplish the major tasks of rehabilitation and reconstruction in three years.

21790	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The blogospheric fan reaction to this year's Oscar nominations included -- as always -- a flurry of what-ifs: concern for ``Dreamgirls''' lack of a Best Picture nod, for the overlooking of Sacha Baron Cohen's acting, for the absence of ``Volver'' in the Best Foreign Language Film category.
21791	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Oh, the agony, the nitpicking, the sighs.
21792	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But for the winners, the winners!
21793	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	From A-list to obscure, Tuesday was for basking.
21794	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The musical ``Dreamgirls'' led the day with eight nominations, followed by the ensemble film ``Babel'' with seven.
21797	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was the wife-and-husband directorial team holding hands when their film's nominations were announced.
21798	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And there was Jackie Earle Haley, a man whose more recent credits include titles such as ``Maniac Cop 3,'' who wept when the honor sank in.
21799	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, crazy day,'' said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as Ronnie the pedophile in ``Little Children.''
21800	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It started off with me pretending to sleep last night,'' he continued.
21801	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
21802	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	You got it!'
21803	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I sat up and I just hugged her and we cried for like five minutes.
21804	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
21805	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Overall, the academy dug international themes and locales, and diversity -- something it has taken a hit for in the past.
21806	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	As for ``Dreamgirls,'' it may have earned the most nominations, but it got snubbed for biggies -- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay.
21807	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	(And let's be candid: The eight nominations include three in the same category, Original Song).
21809	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In addition to Forest Whitaker, Murphy and Hudson, Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor for ``The Pursuit of Happyness'' and Djimon Hounsou for his supporting role in ``Blood Diamonds,'' putting five black actors and actresses in top categories.
21810	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Commenting on the overall diversity in nominations, Deepa Mehta, director of Best Foreign Language Film nominee ``Water,'' said, ``It just shows that it's an international year, isn't it?''
21811	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I think it's wonderful, because I think what the academy has done is acknowledge that there's a whole world of films out there.''
21814	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Royalty, in other words, is big.
21815	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was also some serious Americana -- in the form of ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' which took four major nominations (including Best Picture) for an indie film about a dysfunctional family en route to one of those truly red-white-and-blue events: a little girls' beauty pageant.
21816	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Extra-thick double-fudge icing'' is how producer Peter Saraf referred to the film's Oscar success, which included nods for original screenplay and supporting actors Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
21817	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris watched the announcements on TV, hands clasped together.
21818	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``This is a new one,'' Faris said.
21819	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``We've never been through something like this together, but it's better than going through it alone.''
21821	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The directors?
21823	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Fun bits from Tuesday's announcements in Beverly Hills: Meryl Streep got her 14th Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress as the witchy boss in ``The Devil Wears Prada.''
21824	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Marky Mark -- okay, we should refer to him as Mark Wahlberg for this particular performance -- trumped Academy fave Jack Nicholson for a supporting nod in the star-studded cast of ``The Departed.''
21825	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And ``Little Miss Sunshine's'' 10-year-old Breslin could tie Tatum O'Neal in ``Paper Moon'' for the youngest Oscar winner ever.
21826	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.
21827	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Then there was the choice by the academy's screenwriters to nominate ``Borat,'' a film that was all allegedly unscripted and improvised, for Best Adapted Screenplay (the film scribes are apparently very, very confident of their future job security).
21828	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Speaking of job security, studio heads should perhaps consider backing anything -- anything, even a finger-painting tutorial -- that involves a combination of Clint Eastwood and Kate Winslet.
21829	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Eastwood is a 10-time nominee (this year both for producing and directing ``Iwo Jima'') and a four-time winner (Best Picture and director, for both ``Million Dollar Baby'' and ``Unforgiven'').
21830	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress for ``Little Children.'')
21831	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining Winslet in that category are Penelope Cruz for Pedro Almodovar's ``Volver,'' Judi Dench for ``Notes on a Scandal,'' Streep and Mirren.
21832	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In the Best Actor category, Whitaker is up against Leonardo DiCaprio -- who was nominated for ``Blood Diamond'' but was just as often mentioned for his role in ``The Departed'' -- Peter O'Toole (``Venus''), Ryan Gosling (``Half Nelson'') and Smith.
21833	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I don't think anyone is more shocked than me,'' Gosling said Tuesday, noting that ``Half Nelson'' was a smaller film ``we didn't even expect to get distribution.''
21834	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Arkin got the news that he was up for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the heroin-sniffing porn aficionado in ``Little Miss Sunshine'' while watching the sun rise over his home in New Mexico.
21835	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I guess it was the role that did it,'' he said.
21836	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It was a brilliant script and a brilliant character, and the minute I read the script I knew I wanted to do it.''
21837	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Barraza -- who is originally from Mexico -- was one of several nominees who admitted she didn't sleep the night before.
21838	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I kept thinking yes, yes, yes, and then no, no, no, like a crazy person,'' she said.
21840	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I talked with Al this morning,'' said Davis Guggenheim, the film's director.
21841	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``He was really happy.
21842	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I asked him, 'So you're ready to go to the show?'
21843	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And he said, 'I'll think about it.' ''
21844	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	But Guggenheim, son of the late Washington documentarian Charles Guggenheim, said sure, Al Gore will be there at the Oscars.
21845	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``The thought of him going down the red carpet is really exciting,'' he said. ''
21846	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	... And a billion people will see him, and that means that more people will see the movie and wake up to this very inconvenient truth.''
21848	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	The twosome were flying to Santa Barbara for a screening when they heard the news.
21849	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	A flight attendant had earlier given the pilot a heads-up, and the pilot contacted a United Airlines representative on the ground, who monitored the Internet for the news.
21851	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I'm only going to fly United from now on,'' Ewing said.
21852	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Staff writers Sonya Geis and Ann Hornaday contributed to this report.
21855	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	"Sudan on Wednesday launched several heavily armed (rebel) columns against Chad.
21856	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	These mercenaries crossed the border in the area of Moudeina," north of the border town of Ade, it said on national radio.
21858	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The two leaders are in Dakar this week for a summit of Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
21859	AFP_ENG_20080313.0495.LDC2009T13	The infiltration would be repeat of an incursion that saw rebel columns in pick- up trucks ride into N'Djamena on February 2 and 3 to overthrow Deby, who took shelter in his palace as street fighting raged.
21860	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	DISAPPOINTED ON TWO FRONTS
21861	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	With strong safety Jermaine Phillips out with a broken arm, Sabby Piscitelli has been under increased scrutiny lately.
21862	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And the second-year player from Oregon State responded Sunday with a memorable interception.
21863	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The Bucs led 17-14 early in the fourth, but the Raiders had it first and 10 at the Bucs 26.
21864	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Moments earlier, a face mask against Gaines Adams wiped out Phillip Buchanon's interception.
21865	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right toward tight end Zach Miller.
21866	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The ball was off the mark and Piscitelli was off to the races.
21867	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field, shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11 for an 84-yard return.
21868	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.
21869	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Piscitelli, 25, talked about the return and the disappointment of the season-ending 31-24 defeat.
21870	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Describe the play.
21871	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	JaMarcus tried to look me off, and I just got a good break on it.
21872	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was a good rush and made him (overthrow it).
21873	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I tried to play the ball and do what I could with it.
21874	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm kind of disappointed I didn't score, but that's a long run.
21875	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What was going through your head as you were nearing the end zone?
21876	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I was trying to score.
21877	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I cut back and broke a tackle or two, but your body almost shuts off at that point.
21878	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I even tried to stop and let JaMarcus run by me.
21879	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But my legs were just (shot).
21880	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I just wanted to get all the yards I could at that second.
21881	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Did you see the block that Jackson threw for you?
21882	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	Actually, when I cut off that (block), that's when my body starting shutting down.
21883	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I'm just glad the offense scored, and it kind of bailed us out of that situation.
21884	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	What has happened to this team in the fourth quarter?
21885	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	No excuses.
21886	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	You go to the film, and the most important thing is you have to finish.
21887	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think we did play well on defense.
21888	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But we have to go to the film and see what our mistakes were.
21889	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It's a four-quarter game, and I'm disappointed I couldn't help the team more.
21890	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How disappointing is it to have the season end this way?
21891	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It's rough.
21892	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I know it's something that I take personally.
21893	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	And I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen next year and improve my game to make sure I don't contribute to any losses we have.
21894	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	How important was it to you to make a statement personally?
21895	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's what safeties and corners are there for to make those big plays and try to turn games around.
21896	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	I think the Bucs had that in mind when they drafted me.
21897	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	That's something I have to work on.
21898	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was good to help make a big play and to help us try to win this game.
21899	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The defensive line did a great job on that, so they get most of the credit.

21922	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	The baseball season in Cuba runs from December through April.
21923	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	"The key is to assert authority without abusing it," she said.
21924	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno sometimes works behind the plate, sometimes on the bases.
21926	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She played third base and shortstop and often batted cleanup as a youngster.
21927	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno became an umpire in part because of her frustration at not being able to play in organized leagues.

21932	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She began her career umpiring softball, then moved on to youth baseball games.
21933	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	She eventually enrolled in the National Umpire School in Villa Clara, 220 miles (350 kilometers) from the capital.

21935	APW_ENG_20070531.1915.LDC2009T13	Moreno's story has inspired other women to try their hands at umpiring: Thirty plan to attend the national school when a new round of classes begins in September.

21978	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	INSURERS CITED AS CAUSE OF CLOGGED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY SYSTEM
21979	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle- blowers.
21980	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Insurance companies are the source of the problem, the lawsuits say.
21981	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers are forcing many people who file disability claims with them to also apply to Social Security -- even people who clearly do not qualify for the government program.
21982	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration defines "disabled" much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially.
21983	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.
21984	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The insurers say that requiring a Social Security assessment is a standard practice and that there is nothing wrong with it.
21985	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice.
21986	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Thus, if a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else -- like workers' compensation, a disability pension or Social Security -- the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that amount.
21988	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"Anybody who is forced to come into this system, and who doesn't need to be there, is affecting someone else," said Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as an expert witness for the plaintiffs.
21989	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	"They're holding up cases for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in many cases are much worse off."
21990	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security.
21991	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old- age trust fund.
21992	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work force ages, since recovery time increases with age.
21993	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The number of people waiting for hearings on their claims by an administrative law judge has more than doubled since 2000, and the average wait has grown to 512 days in that time, from 258 days.
21994	NYT_ENG_20080331.0223.LDC2009T13	The Social Security Administration is not an active participant in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them.

22004	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	China's more than 100 million migrant workers do not have a single representative in the nation's parliament, but that may soon change, state media said Thursday.
22006	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	The National People's Congress brings together nearly 3,000 delegates from across the country, but not one is a migrant worker, according to the agency.
22008	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	There are different figures for the exact number of migrant workers in China.
22009	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Xinhua gave a number Thursday of about 200 million migrant workers, of which more than 120 million work in cities and the remainder work in towns.
22010	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Another 13 million farmers will become migrant workers annually in the coming years, it said.
22011	AFP_ENG_20070307.0699.LDC2009T13	Millions of migrant labourers fuelling China's economic boom are forming an urban underclass deprived of rights and victims of widespread abuse, human rights group Amnesty International said in a report published in early March.

22013	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso urges EU states to help Malta on immigration
22016	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The island EU nation, with a population of around 400,000, has rescued some 7,000 people in waters off its coast in the last five years, with scores picked up -- some clinging to tuna farm cages, others dead -- in May alone.
22018	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	The EU Commission president described these events as a "human tragedy for desperate people who are ruthlessly and unforgiveably exploited", and acknowledged the difficulties Malta faced.
22019	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Many people in the rest of Europe were "simply unaware that the search and rescue area and jurisdiction of Malta is larger than the land mass of the United Kingdom, clearly disproportionate to its resources," he said.
22020	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Barroso said that the coordinated maritime patrols between member states launched last month would become a permanent fixture from next January to help patrol the 27-nation bloc's southern borders.
22021	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"I set out today my intention that the European patrols network which started operation last May should become from January 2008 a permanent tool available at the request of member states to curb illegal immigration across the Mediterranean and along the south-east Atlantic coasts," he said.
22022	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Migration would be a central theme of the EU-Africa summit later this year, he added, and the EU Commission would draw up practical guidelines for managing Europe's external border, covering search and rescue operations.
22023	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"The commission cannot solve all the problems, not least (because) we don't have boats or planes.
22024	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	But I recognise that more should be done, especially by member states," Barroso said.
22025	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	"Member states have planes, member states have boats, have resources which they can put at the disposal of a member state that has special difficulty.
22026	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Some political resistance is yet to be overcome."
22027	AFP_ENG_20070615.0397.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the European Union expressed determination to save the lives of African migrants trying to reach its shores but struggled to find concrete ways to help Malta tackle the problem.
22032	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	He said the army was investigating the incident, recorded in an Internet video, and would probably complete the inquiry in two to four weeks.
22034	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The video shows an instructor and a soldier in camouflage uniforms in a forest.
22035	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor tells the soldier, "You are in the Bronx.
22036	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	A black van is stopping in front of you.

22039	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The soldier fires his machine gun several times and yells an obscenity several times in English.
22040	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	The instructor then tells the soldier to curse even louder.
22042	APW_ENG_20070416.0796.LDC2009T13	"We found out about it because a soldier gave his superior a CD on which one could see the images," Raabe said during a news conference Monday.

22056	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	KATHMANDU, Dec. 3 (Xinhua)
22057	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Physically disabled persons in Nepal have expressed dissatisfaction over current political deadlock in the country while marking the International Day of Disabled 2007 on Monday.
22058	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Various programs were organized throughout Nepal to celebrate the 16th International Disabled Day 2007 with the theme of Decent Work for People With Disabilities.
22059	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	However, the disabled persons in Nepal are yet to be convinced if they are going to get decent work opportunity at the time when the country is going through a total mess due to disagreement among political parties.
22060	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We expected representation from our community in the upcoming Constituent Assembly (CA) elections, but it seems like the political leaders have made up their mind to stick on with the interim parliament and keep on postponing the elections," said Chhaya Shrestha, one of the participants of the rally organized to mark the day told Xinhua.
22061	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Lamenting over current coalition government's apathy towards disabled persons, Chhaya criticized the government for failing to offer them any opportunity after democracy was restored in the country.
22062	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We hoped to see physically disabled persons representing us in CA elections but the current political deadlock has put us into doubt if the election is ever going to take place or not," Chhaya added.
22063	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"The politicians only limit proportional representation and inclusive democracy in their speech," she added.
22064	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Similarly, there are thousands of people, who became physically disabled after losing their limbs and body parts during a decade long insurgency, still languishing for government's attention.
22066	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to the association's data, some 2,000 CPN-M combatants who were disabled during the decade long people's conflict are not getting enough attention from the government.
22067	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Central member of the association Chitra Bahadur Gharti, who lost his right hand during the conflict, told Xinhua that some of the party cadres who lost their limbs and body parts during the conflict are currently languishing in seven different United Nations cantonments while those who can still provide assistance are still deployed in the field to carry out various party works.
22068	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"We feel that the welfare of disabled persons is possible only through the restructuring of the state," said Gharti, adding that the main objective of the party would be to provide health, education and employment to the disabled persons.
22069	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He added that the CPN-M is providing skill oriented training to the disabled cadres at the cantonments.
22072	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	He said so far 118 nations have ratified the convention and requested 13 countries including Nepal to ratify it.
22073	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	Bennett noted, the majority of people with disabilities live in conditions of poverty, adding that "Access to decent work is the key to breaking that poverty trap, while the self sufficiency that work with fair pay and conditions brings enhances the dignity of the worker and contributes to the entire society and economy."
22074	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	According to a press release issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO), of an estimated 650 million disabled people in the world, approximately 470 million are of working age.
22075	XIN_ENG_20071203.0283.LDC2009T13	"There is a strong link between disability and poverty," the ILO report says.

22082	APW_ENG_20071006.0328.LDC2009T13	The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the official results can only be declared after it rules on petitions lodged by Musharraf's opponents that his candidacy is unconstitutional.

22088	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some are killed by dogs and some simply die from thirst," said Han Baohong, director of the forestry bureau in Fuhai County, on the lower reaches of the Ulungur River.
22089	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	"After the snow has melted in May, the drought will make living conditions even worse," he said.
22090	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Some beavers had started digging into the banks of irrigation channels, posing a threat to local agricultural production.
22091	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The population of beavers in China is about 500, even lower than that of the giant panda.
22092	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	Beavers usually spend winter in nests built in riverbanks where water levels exceed 1.5 meters.
22094	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The water volume of the Ulungur River is just 60 percent of level at the same time last year.
22095	XIN_ENG_20070504.0081.LDC2009T13	The forestry administration has called on residents to help protect beavers.

22134	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
22135	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Most of us understand that an overabundance of cheap, easy credit created a housing bubble that artificially inflated the price of land and housing, produced too many homes and homeowners, and persuaded too many Americans to dip into their home equity to support a lifestyle their income could not sustain.

22140	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Unlike housing, which began losing steam two years ago, these other sectors have just begun the painful process of repricing and finding a new balance between supply and demand.
22141	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Take the case of the airline industry, which likes to blame its woes on skyrocketing fuel prices.
22142	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	While there's an ongoing debate about why the price of oil has doubled over the past year, there is little doubt that the declining dollar is a significant factor.
22143	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The decline is the result of years of large and growing U.S. trade deficits that should have caused the exchange rate to adjust years ago but didn't because so many of our trading partners in Asia and the Middle East were intent on linking their currencies to the dollar.
22144	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	In the process of maintaining those dollar pegs and reinvesting those surpluses in Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, they created a surfeit of cheap credit that spawned all those bubbles.
22145	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Now that the process is reversing itself, the overvalued dollar is being repriced.
22146	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
22147	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Producers have raised their dollar prices to prevent a decline in the global purchasing power from their commodities sales.
22148	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
22149	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At some point, that speculative bubble will burst and energy prices will plunge.
22150	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	When things finally settle down, the new equilibrium price is almost certain to be well above where it was last year at this time.
22151	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That said, jet fuel is hardly the airlines' only problem.
22152	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The reality is that for too many years, airlines have sold too many tickets at prices that failed to reflect the real cost of providing the service passengers want and expect.
22153	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That includes such things as cleaning planes
22154	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	handling reservations, check-ins and baggage without undue waiting
22155	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	serving a decent meal when necessary
22156	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	and treating passengers fairly when flights are canceled.
22157	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But they also include costs that may be less obvious, like keeping up with preventive maintenance, hedging fuel costs, paying a decent wage to front-line employees, investing in modern air traffic control systems, and paying a price that reflects the true value of scarce air space and landing rights.
22158	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Airline executives will say that if they were to charge enough to reflect all these costs, they would have many fewer passengers.
22159	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That's the point: A sustainable equilibrium will inevitably involve a smaller industry with fewer planes, fewer flights, fewer passengers and fewer employees.
22160	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And what about that $199 round-trip fare from Washington to L.A.?
22161	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
22163	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	And you can add a third blow, this one from government.
22164	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Across the country, state and local governments are already hip- deep into budget crises in response to declining revenue from property assessments and real estate transfers.
22165	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Here in Washington, a dramatic drop off in revenue from business profits and capital gains has wiped out any hope of reducing federal operating deficits that, under the likeliest political and economic scenarios, will exceed $500 billion a year for as far as the eye can see.
22166	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	This is another example of an unsustainable equilibrium that has roots in the trade deficit and the credit bubble.
22167	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Despite the happy talk you might be hearing from the presidential candidates, it presents Americans with a stark and unpleasant choice.
22168	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	One option is to raise taxes and leave less money for private spending, which is what many state and local governments have begun to do.
22169	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
22170	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Either way, it amounts to a lower standard of living than we thought we had achieved.
22171	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Is all this the end of the world?
22172	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the richest country on the planet, certainly not.
22173	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But it does represent the end of a decade or more during which Americans were permitted and even encouraged by the rest of the world -- and by their own leaders -- to live way beyond their means.
22174	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	As a result, the United States has gone from being the largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor.
22175	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	For the first time since the early 1980s, Americans will have to endure several years of uncomfortably slow growth and uncomfortably high inflation as the U.S. economy regains its balance and creates a foundation for more solid and sustainable growth.

22189	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	XINTAI, China 2007-08-21 06:34:51 UTC
22190	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Families of more than 180 miners trapped in flooded coal mines in eastern China and presumed dead lashed out at one of the companies Tuesday, complaining it had ignored safety warnings to close.
22191	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Rescue workers were pumping water in a bid to reach 172 miners missing for four days in the Huayuan mine and nine others in a smaller mine run by another company "despite dim hopes for anyone to survive," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
22192	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The miners have been trapped since Friday afternoon when a dike collapsed, several hours after other mines in the area had pulled their workers to the surface because of flooding fears.
22193	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"The news reports say it is a natural disaster because of the rain, but the accident is because of the mine management.
22194	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Every year there is flooding," said Ma Xiumei, who came with her sister to the mine headquarters in Xintai, Shandong province, for information about their missing brother.
22195	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"If these miners are safely brought home we won't say a thing, but if it is the worst then they (the company) need to think about my younger brother's laid-off wife, his children, his aging mother," said Ma Xiuhua.
22196	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	At least two other mines in the area have said that worries about unusually heavy rains had prompted them to shut down Friday morning, raising questions about why the Huayuan Mining Co. continued to operate.
22197	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The state-run China Daily also reported Tuesday that relatives were complaining about "human error."
22198	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It quoted one worker as saying the mine had flooded every year since 2002.
22199	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Huayuan also reportedly received six phone calls from the Xintai Administration for Work Safety on Friday, before the accident, but took no action," the newspaper reported.
22200	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	It said the administration urged local mines to stop production and evacuate mines during torrential rainstorms.
22202	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Calls to the company and to the safety administration were not answered Tuesday.
22203	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The company and local government appeared to be isolating families and pressuring them to keep their anger in check after one family attacked a Huayuan office with sticks on Monday.
22204	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some neighborhoods with a lot of mining families have been sealed off, with plain-clothed guards keeping outsiders away.
22205	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Some families have also been taken away and put up in hotels in the main center of Xintai, a 15-minute drive from the mining company offices.
22206	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	One person who managed to sneak away from a hotel said the families had been told not to talk to each other.
22207	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	While the Ma sisters were speaking to a reporter, a woman with short-cropped hair and wearing white pants and a white shirt with a black leopard-spot pattern pulled Ma Xiumei aside.
22208	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	"Don't make a big thing about this, you have to think about your brother's job," the woman said.
22209	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Ma Xiumei said the woman worked for the mining company.
22210	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Security officials have also been trailing reporters in Xintai, nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of Beijing.
22212	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	The coal industry is a particular challenge.
22213	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Coal feeds most of China's energy needs, and accidents kill an average of 13 miners a day.
22214	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Tempers among the miners' families boiled over Monday.
22215	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	Several relatives of a missing miner used wooden sticks to smash a reception window and display cases at a company office.
22216	APW_ENG_20070821.0247.LDC2009T13	They then rushed into Huayuan's nearby compound, followed by other relatives.

22233	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	MARINE ' S DEFENSE TEAM ABRUPTLY ENDS HEARING
22236	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Lawyers for the defendant, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, had been expected to call a fellow infantryman, who testified last week against Wuterich, back to the stand.
22238	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	After a three-hour delay, however, the defense dropped its plan to cross-examine Dela Cruz and the hearing ended.
22239	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Dela Cruz, who received immunity in April after prosecutors dropped murder charges against him in exchange for his testimony, had testified that Wuterich fired his M-16 rifle at the five men as they stood near the car, some with their hands raised in surrender.
22240	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	The defense had been expected to challenge that view.
22241	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich has admitted to shooting the men but said they began running away, defying orders to halt.
22242	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	His lawyers argued that running away in the moments after the bomb detonated could be construed as a hostile act under the Marine Corps rules of engagement in Iraq, where such attacks have posed the most frequent and deadliest threat to U.S. troops.
22243	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	But Wuterich's lawyers have not been able to prove that the men were running away
22244	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	on the contrary, testimony from a government forensic expert said the men's wounds suggested that they were not moving away when they were shot.
22246	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Kallop was also granted immunity in return for his testimony.
22247	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Wuterich's hearing is the last involving the four men initially charged with murder after the attack.
22248	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Murder charges against one of two enlisted men were dismissed in July.
22249	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Last month, Lt. Col. Paul J. Ware, who has presided over the hearings for all three enlisted men in the Haditha case, recommended dismissing all charges against the other enlisted man, but no decision has been made.
22250	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Those two men -- Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum -- were charged with killing nine people.
22252	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	Before the proceeding closed, Wuterich read a nine-page statement to Ware, who will advise a Marine general whether sufficient evidence exists to forward the charges to a court-martial.
22253	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	In the statement, Wuterich took responsibility for his decisions in the heat of battle to kill people in the two houses who he said were suspected of being armed insurgents, and for the order he gave to his men to "shoot first, ask questions later."
22254	NYT_ENG_20070907.0024.LDC2009T13	"I wanted them to understand," he said, repeating a central argument of his defense, "that hesitation to shoot would only result in the four of us being killed."
