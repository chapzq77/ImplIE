175	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His family needed the $2,600-a-month salary, so Troy kept driving and Michelle rode in the truck with him.
179	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	That meant before he could receive his VA disability check, Troy had to pay back the $11,349 he received when he left the Army.
180	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 13 months, VA withheld his check until the Army amount was reimbursed.

183	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His illness has eroded their marriage, but on the morning they arrive at the Martinsburg VA hospital, she leads the charge on his behalf.

195	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They say they need to come out and do a home study," Michelle says.
196	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
197	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Don't let these people get over on you!"

228	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government has promised to care for its wounded, but the proof is often in cramped places such as this, where disabled veterans stand in line to get their mileage reimbursed.

231	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle steps to one window and gets a receipt for $14.52.
234	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Money became so desperate this spring that Michelle contacted Operation Homefront, a national organization that gives emergency assistance to deployed service members and the returning wounded.
236	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.
239	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has been pushing to have VA re-evaluate Troy in hopes of getting his disability rating raised and his compensation increased.

477	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	Amsterdam has been conducting a crackdown on criminality in the city center for nearly five years, using a 2002 law that forces business operators to disclose detailed accounting in order to have their licenses renewed.
478	APW_ENG_20071116.0635.LDC2009T13	A panel set up under the law concluded that there is a serious risk the club's owners will use it as a front for criminal activities.

491	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	As expected, however, the findings focus most of their attention on the gravest terror problem: Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network.
500	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	For instance, the report says that worldwide counterterrorism efforts since 2001 have constrained al-Qaida's ability to attack the U.S. again and convinced terror groups that U.S. soil is a tougher target.
502	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	Among the report's other findings:
504	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The group is proficient with conventional small arms and improvised explosive devices and is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcoming security obstacles."
507	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	--The group will continue to seek weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological or nuclear material -- and "would not hesitate to use them."
511	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The publicly disclosed judgments, laid out over two pages, are part of a longer document, which remains classified.
512	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	It was approved by the heads of all 16 intelligence agencies on June 21.
513	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	In the last week, reports on this document and another threat assessment on al-Qaida's resurgence have renewed the debate in Washington about whether the Bush administration is on the right course in its war on terror, particularly in Iraq.
517	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	The high-level estimate notes that the spread of radical ideas, especially on the Internet, growing anti-U.S. rhetoric and increasing numbers of radical cells throughout Western countries indicate the violent segments of the Muslim populations is expanding.
518	APW_ENG_20070717.0848.LDC2009T13	"The arrest and prosecution by U.S. law enforcement of a small number of violent Islamic extremists inside the United States ... points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate," the estimate said.

522	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
523	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
524	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The recommendations would leave the former Yugoslav province free to declare independence from Serbia, according to Western diplomats who discussed the plan that will be made public next week.
526	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	As a result, the proposals fall short of the full independence so hoped for by the territory's majority population of ethnic Albanians, according to Western diplomats.
532	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	But that step, diplomats caution, is probably months away.
535	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even then, only the broad outlines of the proposal are expected to be made public.
536	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Kosovo and Belgrade remain far apart in their positions, and experts say it is unlikely Ahtisaari can close the gap.

686	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador claims the election was tainted by fraud and has refused to accept Calderon's victory.
689	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Lopez Obrador said this year he would celebrate with followers in San Jose Tenango in southern Oaxaca state, one of the poorest municipalities in Mexico.
693	APW_ENG_20070916.0099.LDC2009T13	Mexicans arriving for the nighttime celebration went through metal detectors and were received by blaring speakers on opposites sides of the plaza competing for their attention -- and making it impossible to hear.

699	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of Congress heard wrenching testimony on Monday from wounded soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and contrite promises from top Army officials to correct the conditions there.
704	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The unusual venue also provided an emotional backdrop for the hearing, the first of several that congressional committees intend to hold.
705	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The subcommittee members heard first on Monday from two soldiers badly hurt in the war in Iraq, and from the spouse of another soldier injured in Iraq, about their experiences at Walter Reed.
707	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Wearing a black eye patch, Staff Sgt. John Daniel Shannon described to lawmakers how he was struck in the head by a round from an AK-47 in November 2004 during a firefight near Ramadi, causing a traumatic brain injury and the loss of one eye.
708	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Within a week of the injury, Shannon was released to outpatient treatment, he recounted.
711	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He then waited several weeks wondering whether anyone would contact him about additional treatment, eventually calling people himself until he reached his caseworker.
713	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	His paperwork, he said, was lost repeatedly, forcing him to start over several times.

723	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	The Bush administration has been thrown on the defensive, and members of Congress have been quick to express outrage.
725	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Tierney declared the problems at Walter Reed to be part of broader dysfunction at military health care facilities across the country and wondered whether it was "another horrific consequence of the terrible planning that went into our invasion of Iraq."

735	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Members of the committee from both parties were sharply critical during the hearing, some arguing that government audits and news articles have hinted at similar problems for years.
736	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the committee, said the military's entire system for handling wounded veterans is in need of a "top down overhaul."
738	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, the surgeon general of the Army, who also headed Walter Reed several years ago, apologized to soldiers and said the bureaucratic process they faced demanded "urgent simplification."
739	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"We really need to reinvent this process," Kiley said.
740	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Kiley was initially appointed to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman as commander of the hospital last week, but the appointment came under fire because he had previously appeared to downplay problems at the hospital when he was in command in 2004.
742	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	He explained that inspections of barracks were not part of his normal job duties.
744	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"I want you to know that I think this is a massive failure of competency and management and command," said Rep. Paul W. Hodes, D-N.H.
745	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	Beyond specific steps to streamline the bureaucratic process that is faced by wounded troops and to improve living conditions, military officials said it may be time to re-evaluate whether Walter Reed should be closed in several years, as had been previously planned as part of a national base reorganization process.
747	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	But Staff Sgt. Brian Beem, who lost his right leg to a makeshift bomb in Baghdad in October, said he had no idea conditions were so bad for some of his counterparts, even though he had heard grumbling.
748	NYT_ENG_20070305.0216.LDC2009T13	"At my level," Beem said, "I'm ignorant of it."

758	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	"That is why I can't be pessimistic about the future (of the EU), when I see where we are now and where we come from."
759	AFP_ENG_20071222.0093.LDC2009T13	He noted that the lifting of the barriers was more than a symbolic or political gesture, and that it had "concrete meaning" for Europeans, allowing easier travel, improving relations between states and enhancing growth and employment.

964	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	A set of amendments to the constitution that would have strengthened state institutions but preserved the entities failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament.
965	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	EU-led efforts at police reform were likewise rejected in October.
966	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early November, the current High Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, in an effort to break the political gridlock, announced two constitutional reforms that would have made the passage of national legislation easier.
967	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	These reforms essentially challenged the practice of elected representatives and government ministers of absenting themselves from key votes.
968	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	RS politicians, who frequently deployed this tactic to avoid being outvoted, interpreted these reforms as a threat to the entity and to their ethnic protections at the state level.

972	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In early December a compromise solution was reached, but the issue of the future constitutional order of Bosnia remains unresolved.
976	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	However, the events of the past six months have clearly demonstrated that Bosnia is still not fully prepared to go it alone.
978	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	The RS may not be hesitant about using its new economic power to push for more devolution of political power.
980	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If the international community commits itself to finishing the job and pushing aggressively for reforms that lead to a constitutional government capable of serving all the people of Bosnia - and meeting its international obligations - the future of the country will brighten considerably.
981	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	If, however, the international community turns its back on Bosnia, the country will likely sink further into political dysfunction and instability.That outcome looks far more ominous than anything that is likely to occur in Kosovo during the next year.
982	NYT_ENG_20080111.0088.LDC2009T13	In view of the enormous investment that the international community has made in Bosnia since the signing of the DaytonAgreement in 1995, and the importance of stability in the heart of Europe, failure cannot be an option.

1049	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	From the start of the theory's acceptance, geologists worked hard to discover what plate tectonics revealed about Earth's past and to render it in credible reconstructions.
1050	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	A famous result was Pangea -- "all the land" in Greek -- a supercontinent that some 200 million years ago held the outlines of today's continents in embryonic form.
1052	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
1055	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
1057	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Such visualizations caught the eye of Scotese in the late 1970s when he was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
1059	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	With his graduate adviser, he made detailed maps showing the past evolution of the continents.
1060	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And he toyed with their future shapes.
1062	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
1066	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
1067	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Scotese drew a series of futuristic maps and, in the 1990s, found an ideal way to communicate his increasingly detailed visions of the terrestrial past and future: over the Internet.
1068	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, Scotese's Web site, www.scotese.com, which he started in 1998, showcases his work, called the Paleomap Project.

1088	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Scotese said, the biggest tectonic change of all -- driven by a giant subduction zone -- has torn through the dark Atlantic and begun to eat up seabed, slowly closing the ocean.
1095	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	It implies that it's the last Pangea, which certainly isn't true, but it's the last one I'm going to come up with."
1096	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Over billions of years, the continents have split and joined repeatedly in a slow dance.
1097	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
1099	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.
1102	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
1103	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Instead of the Atlantic disappearing, they say, the Pacific might slowly vanish, sending North and South America careering into Asia.
1106	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"My guess," he said, "is that the Pacific should disappear."

1377	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	It's been an erratic week on Wall Street, with the Dow soaring 936 points on Monday, slipping moderately Tuesday, sinking 733 points Wednesday, and then rallying 401 points Thursday.
1378	APW_ENG_20081017.0820.LDC2009T13	The volatility is not providing investors with much relief, but it is a welcome change from last week's seemingly relentless plunge, during which the Dow logged its worst week ever and Wall Street lost about $2.4 trillion in shareholder wealth.

1411	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
1414	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The IPCC suggests that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the range of 25-40 percent by 2020 is necessary in order to keep the earth's temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsus.
1415	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
1416	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
1417	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	However, one notable success so far is the agreement on Monday evening on the Adaptation Fund, with the final text being greeted by enthusiastic applause.

1423	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
1424	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
1425	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to.

1466	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons have gone from the White House to the poorhouse to the penthouse, earning $109 million since 2000, according to tax returns released by the campaign late Friday.
1468	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	He's also raked in $29.6 million from his books, including his autobiography "My Life," which earned tepid reviews.
1469	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
1473	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
1475	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
1477	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Compared to most Americans, the couple is unfathomably rich, but they are middle-of-the-pack millionaires in the U.S. Senate with a net worth of between $12 million and $50 million, according to various accounts.
1480	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
1482	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
1484	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.
1485	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Uncollected interest estimates required by the Internal Revenue Service indicate the loans were substantial, possibly in excess of $100,000, according to accountants.

1530	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Children's Cold Remedies Raised Questions for Years
1531	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
1532	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It never ceased to aggravate me," said Sharfstein, a pediatrician and father of two young boys.
1534	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
1536	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Why didn't the FDA act sooner?
1539	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
1542	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
1544	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You're just left scratching your head about how this could go on for so long."
1545	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The answers lie in the history of drug regulation and the evolution in scientific thinking about how drugs work in adults and children: Many over-the-counter medicines arrived on the market before government requirements for stringent testing, and it was long considered unethical and unnecessary to test drugs in children.
1546	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are among many products that have been sold for decades, well before the FDA had authority to regulate them closely.
1547	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
1548	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
1551	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
1552	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
1553	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So the panel made a crucial decision: recommending in 1976 that doses for children be extrapolated from data from adults.
1558	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But as researchers began testing some of the products directly in children, they slowly started to raise disturbing questions.
1561	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
1562	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Where do parents get a lot of their information?
1567	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I think there was a vacuum in leadership on this issue by the professional societies," Lurie said.
1576	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
1577	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But Sharfstein and others wonder whether the medical profession could have been more aggressive.
1579	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
1581	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	They could have justified one.
1584	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
1585	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
1591	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But if you don't have evidence that the products work and you have kids who have died from taking them, I don't think there's a role for them."

2199	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A year after the introduction of the sturdy gray bicycles known as Velib's, they are being used all over Paris.
2202	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	The stations are only some 300 yards apart, and there are four times as many as there are subway stations, even in a city so well served by its metro system.

2208	NYT_ENG_20080712.0093.LDC2009T13	A kind of Velib' behavior has emerged, especially at the morning rush, with people swiftly checking for bikes in the best condition: tires inflated, chains still attached, baskets unstolen.

2231	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
2232	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
2233	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Her testimony was buttressed by previously unreleased documents provided as evidence Thursday, including handwritten notes and margin scribblings Cheney's staff hastily jotted at their boss' instruction.
2239	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
2240	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
2241	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton warned the defense that Libby would have to take the stand if he wanted to try to persuade the jury that his own memory was flawed.
2244	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	The NIE actually mentioned several doubts.
2247	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
2251	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby told her, Martin testified, that Cheney, in a rare move, authorized him to provide a specific quote on the record, with Libby's name attached.
2252	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
2254	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
2256	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``I did not have a conversation with the vice president about that,'' Martin responded.

2270	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
2273	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
2274	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.

2399	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, 26, spoke publicly for the first time about the events of Nov. 19, 2005, in an interview with the CBS' "60 Minutes," scheduled for broadcast Sunday night.
2400	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was justified in firing at the men because he had identified them as military-age males in a car close to where a roadside bomb had just detonated, killing one of Wuterich's squad.
2402	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Normally the Iraqis know the drill.
2403	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	If something happens, get down, hands up," Wuterich told CBS.
2405	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The government investigation into the killings was leaked to The Washington Post.
2406	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	In January, the newspaper ran a story that said witnesses told investigators that the men did not run away and Wuterich shot them as they stood, unarmed, by the taxi about 10 feet (3 meters) in front of him.
2408	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich was charged in December with 13 counts of unpremeditated murder.
2412	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Following the taxi shooting, Wuterich said, he was given permission from a superior officer to raid a house suspected to have a sniper inside.
2413	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	The Marines did this using grenades and gunfire, according the CBS News release.
2414	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he knew women and children were killed in that house, but he didn't stop the assault because he saw an open doorway leading toward a second house and believed the sniper had escaped through it.
2415	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"My responsibility as a squad leader is to make sure that none of the rest of my guys died," Wuterich told CBS.
2416	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Wuterich said he was sorry women and children died, but he believes he was acting according to how he had been trained.
2417	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"Did we know that civilians were in there?
2418	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	No," Wuterich told CBS.
2421	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	"There is nothing that I can possibly say to make up or make well the deaths of those women and children, and I am absolutely sorry it happened that day," Wuterich told CBS.
2423	APW_ENG_20070316.0001.LDC2009T13	Those are decisions that I made in a combat situation and I believe I had to make those decisions."
2424	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	SKorea raises key interest rate
2425	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	South Korea on Thursday raised its key interest rate for the first time in almost a year in an apparent attempt to curb high liquidity growth.
2427	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The call rate, the interest on overnight interbank loans, had been left at 4.5 percent since September 2006 in an attempt to spur economic growth amid subdued inflation.
2432	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	In the first half of this year, new loans to smaller companies rose 1.7 times from a year earlier.
2435	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the government similarly increased its growth forecast to 4.6 percent.
2438	AFP_ENG_20070711.0737.LDC2009T13	The June figure, however, stayed within the central bank's target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for 2007-09.
2441	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now the management at the co-op is telling me I have to have the carpet replaced because of a terrible odor.
2443	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The manager of the co-op claims the carpet was laid over a concrete slab and that's the problem.
2444	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	He says the carpet has retained moisture and is moldy.
2446	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What else can be done?
2447	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Answer: Without examining or testing your concrete for moisture content I can't be sure, but I'd bet a dime to a dollar your concrete floor is emitting moisture.
2449	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	The other involves using calcium chloride, and the dryness of the chemical is checked several times over 72 hours.
2450	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Basically, both tests will tell you the same thing: the amount of water, in number of pounds, being emitted per 1,000 square feet of floor in a 24-hour period.
2453	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	They are not considered totally accurate because they measure slabs only in terms of an overall percentage or give readings only at the surface.
2456	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Now, what are your options?
2461	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	To keep the tile floor a little warmer and cozier, use area rugs, which can be cleaned commercially or replaced when necessary.
2464	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Seven years ago, I had a blacktop driveway installed.
2465	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Since then, I've had several people tell me I need to have the driveway sealed.
2466	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Some people tell me it needs to be done annually.
2467	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	What's the truth?
2468	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Dennis Kellerman, a co-owner of Pioneer Asphalt in Kings Park, N.Y., told me one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is sealing asphalt driveways every year.
2469	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``That's too much,'' he said.
2470	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	``The best way to tell if your blacktop needs a sealant is to look for the white stones in the asphalt.
2472	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Generally, Kellerman said, it's about every four or five years, not every year or two.
2473	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Hope that helps.
2474	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Q. I have a problem with clover.
2475	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	How can I get rid of it?
2477	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	A.: Clover comes up in the middle of the summer, usually, and has a high nitrogen content, so many organic lawn care specialists think it makes lawns more attractive.
2479	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	That said, the best way -- organically -- to keep it from coming back is using a slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer in the spring.
2480	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	This will enable the lawn to overtake the clover naturally, because the lawn greens up and comes out of its dormancy before the clover.
2482	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	As for ants, pyrethrum powders are made from dried pyrethrum flowers, such as Chrysanthemums, and they're a low-toxic alternative to a man-made chemical called permethrin.
2484	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	Sprinkle the powder over mounds on the patio or in between cracks of concrete and asphalt.
2485	LTW_ENG_20070807.0103.LDC2009T13	You'll likely have to repeat the procedure a couple of times each spring and again during the summer.

2521	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	CIA REPORT DETAILS MISSTEPS BEFORE SEPT. 11 ATTACKS (SUBS FOR REWRITING THROUGHOUT.)
2523	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
2526	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But none of those officers thought to notify the FBI about the potential domestic threat, the report says -- evidence of what it calls a systemic failure.
2531	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Until Tuesday, the report itself had been kept under wraps by the spy agency, which opposed a public airing of its failures before the Sept. 11 attacks.
2532	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The summary of the report was released at the insistence of Congress, over Hayden's objections, under the terms of a law passed earlier this summer.
2539	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It found that no CIA employee violated the law, and that none of their errors amount to misconduct.
2540	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	But the report did conclude that CIA resources devoted to counterterrorism had been mismanaged, and that some were redirected away from targeting al-Qaida toward other parts of the agency's clandestine service.
2546	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Tenet resigned from the agency in June 2004.
2547	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	The recommendation that the agency establish an "accountability board" to determine possible disciplinary action was rejected in October 2005 by Goss, who was the CIA director at the time, and who argued that punishing top officials for the intelligence breakdown "would send the wrong message to our junior officers about taking risks."
2551	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a memoir published earlier this year, Tenet cited the CIA's efforts against al-Qaida as one of the successes of his tenure, and portrayed the CIA as having been bold in sounding alarms during the summer of 2001 about the threat posed by al-Qaida.
2557	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	It said that the principal responsibility for Mohammed, who became the terrorist mastermind, had been assigned to a branch of the agency responsible for bringing terror suspects to justice, not to the one responsible for assessing threats.
2559	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	In a note to agency employees on Tuesday, Hayden made it clear that he continued to oppose the report's release.
2564	NYT_ENG_20070821.0174.LDC2009T13	Va., and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, said on Tuesday that they believed the CIA had corrected many of the problems detailed in the report.

2582	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman said that the problems in the economy and markets "are large and complex, but in my judgment, our government now has the tools it needs to confront and solve them."
2585	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in markets and financial institutions.
2587	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	"Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away," Bernanke said.
2590	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Credit markets will take some time to unfreeze."
2591	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke added that the overall recovery "will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning."
2594	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	Bernanke meanwhile expressed confidence in the longer-term outlook once the credit and banking problems are fixed.

2616	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	Shanshal said the recent strategies "under the pretext of implementing law" were actually sowing the seeds of hatred.
2618	AFP_ENG_20080418.0285.LDC2009T13	You are creating hatred and negative feelings," Shanshal told AFP during a visit to Sadr City on Friday.

3268	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
3270	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	She needed to go back on dialysis three days a week to clear toxins from her blood, but North Carolina didn't cover that either.
3271	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
3275	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The disparities reflect the nation's conflicting attitudes toward its estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.
3277	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dialysis offers a striking example of the dilemmas -- and the occasional absurdities -- that result.
3278	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The number of patients is not large.
3281	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But dialysis stands out because it is often a lifetime commitment.
3286	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.
3288	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Repeated rescuing not only threatens patients' long-term health, it generally costs more than routine care, some experts argue.
3290	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Such patients are at increased risk of heart attacks and infections.

3299	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

3304	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	What's left is an ambiguous policy that the federal government itself has struggled to clarify.
3307	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	More recently, she acknowledged that the federal government has been sharing the cost in California for years.
3308	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It has long been left to the states to decide whether to provide routine dialysis, she said.
3311	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	North Carolina, for example, now provides routine dialysis for illegal immigrants.
3319	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of one routine treatment is about $250.
3320	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The cost of providing it in the emergency room can climb into the thousands of dollars, especially if the patient has to be admitted to the hospital.
3321	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	To advocates of stricter immigration controls, such comparisons miss the point.
3325	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
3326	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Now, a free transportation service picks her up three days a week for her dialysis in Torrance.
3333	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals pay for plane tickets back.
3336	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
3337	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But she can't afford the treatment there, she said.
3340	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
3341	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Several studies show that a transplant pays for itself in three dialysis-free years.
3346	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.

3375	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	There's no coffee war going on.
3376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
3378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
3379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
3385	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new announcements is a desire to revisit the company's early devotion to high-quality coffee.
3388	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Baristas will be directed to brew smaller batches of coffee and refresh the coffee in urns every 30 minutes.
3389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
3392	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Customers will also be encouraged to visit the site to make suggestions and interact with employees.
3393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
3394	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
3396	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
3400	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.
3401	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
3402	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.
3403	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Shareholders and employees began lining up for Wednesday's event as early as 6 a.m.

3413	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	The bank's increased participation in the money markets stems from Thursday's turbulent Canadian and U.S. stock market activity.
3415	APW_ENG_20070809.1451.LDC2009T13	That sent stocks lower in Europe and the United States as investors looked for safer havens such as Treasurys.
3420	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	With profit down 28 percent, Starbucks said it would open fewer new stores in the United States, slash expenses and sell better- tasting coffee in the face of a troubled economy that is leaving some consumers with less discretionary income.
3422	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We're redirecting the growth of our U.S. stores to reflect the tough economy."

3429	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	What used to be an "affordable luxury," is no longer that for some customers, Schultz said, referring to Starbuck's signature espresso drinks.
3430	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers' discretionary spending habits," Schultz said.
3434	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"At least they're on the road to recovery, but I think it's going to be a long road."
3435	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue.
3436	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.
3437	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that," Schultz said.
3438	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	"There are no sacred cows."
3440	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year between 2009 and 2011.
3441	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Starbucks' store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.
3443	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	About 70 percent of that will be for stores.
3449	NYT_ENG_20080501.0011.LDC2009T13	Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit per share of 90 cents to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.

3505	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - This year's Academy Awards ceremony was still three weeks away when Stefan Ruzowitzky and Karl Markovics were here to promote "The Counterfeiters."
3506	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Ruzowitzky wrote and directed and Markovics stars in the based-on-fact drama about a massive Nazi-run counterfeiting operation during World War II that used concentration camp prisoners.
3509	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics and Ruzowitzky spoke of the award with mounting animation - though not enough to mar their fluent, moderately accented, English.
3511	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"Growing up in a village in Austria, the Oscars were always out there, an event."
3512	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"I'm actually a little amazed how enthusiastic the reactions are back home," Ruzowitzky said.
3514	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So I'm a national hero now," he laughed.
3516	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics plays Sally Sorowitsch - "the world's best counterfeiter," a policeman calls him.
3520	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Is Sally a hero?
3521	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	A villain?
3526	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There's only surviving to the next day and being able to face yourself in the mirror."
3529	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Then we find out he does have ideals.
3530	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	They are not ours, they are not the ideals of a good citizen.
3532	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Artistry is as much the subject of "The Counterfeiters" as heroism.
3535	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Each earns his income creating a version of reality meant to withstand scrutiny - whether that reality be a character, film, or scrap of legal tender.
3538	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	In person, Markovics looked very different from the way he appears in "The Counterfeiters."
3543	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Markovics brings a sense of brooding inwardness to Sally, a man whose hunched shoulders and hooded eyes indicate he has closed off any opening to his interior life.
3545	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"This always attracts me more than showing everything, going out completely, and hiding nothing.
3546	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	This character especially gave me a chance to do this."
3551	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to balance the inmates," Ruzowitzky explained, "to show that everybody's right, in a way.
3555	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	So actually we shot some scenes showing a darker side of Burger, but very soon I found out that everybody goes for Sally anyhow.
3556	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	Why?
3560	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	That's a real difference.
3562	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	For us, I don't know any battles.
3564	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The Holocaust has a particular resonance for Ruzowitzky: His grandparents were Nazis.
3565	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The one hard and fast rule he had while filming was never to have the camera assume a Nazi character's point of view.
3566	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The idea was to be very strict always to show the whole story though the eyes of Sally," Ruzowitzky explained.
3570	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	My ((director of photography)) and I felt this should be true for us as well."
3572	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	There are ways in which the World War II film it most resembles isn't one about the Holocaust but "The Bridge on the River Kwai."
3575	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"If you meet Mr. Burger, he's this 90-year-old man who's anti-fascist to the bone: whose mission in life is to talk about the crimes of the Nazis.
3579	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The success of movies like 'Lives of Others' and 'Downfall' ((the 2004 release in which Bruno Ganz played Hitler)) has helped us a lot.
3584	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	The most obvious sign of that, of course, is last year's foreign- language Oscar for "The Lives of Others" and now this year's for "The Counterfeiters."
3585	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	It's not just the films themselves that have won, though.
3586	NYT_ENG_20080303.0071.LDC2009T13	"The mother of my auto mechanic," Markovics recalled, "she was asking me, 'Will we get the Oscar?'

3593	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company, named Anheuser-Busch InBev, will be headed by InBev CEO Carlos Brito and will be headquartered at Leuven, Belgium.
3595	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch President and CEO August A. Busch IV joins the new company's board as a non-executive director.
3596	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Anheuser-Busch shares stopped trading Monday and will now be swapped for $70 each in cash.
3606	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The new company leapfrogs SABMiller as top brewer and becomes one of the world's top five consumer goods companies.
3607	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Brito said the combination had created "a stronger, more competitive global company with a leading international brand portfolio and distribution network, and great potential for growth all over the world."
3610	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	It said it was necessary to prevent Anheuser-Busch InBev becoming a monopoly in the country.
3611	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	This curbs future growth in the world's most populous nation.
3618	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev has borrowed $45 billion to pay for the deal and secured $9.8 billion in equity bridge financing that it had planned to replace with a share issue in October.
3619	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	But rocky financial markets forced it to postpone issuing new shares and it says it can keep the bridge financing in place for up to six months after it closes the deal and issue shares early next year.
3620	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev says the company is well positioned to cope with a slowing global economy because costs for key ingredients such as grain malt for brewing beer and aluminum for beer cans will fall even as sales stall.
3625	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The European Commission on Monday called for a temporary cut in EU sugar production to avoid surplus sugar stocks.
3626	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The 27 EU nations should cut their sugar production by 2 million tons, or 12 percent, for the 2007-08 production year, EU Farm Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said.
3627	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Part of the quota for that period will either have to counted toward the quota for the following year, or be sold for industrial use, such as bioethanol.
3629	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU reformed its sugar subsidy program in 2005, ending the dumping of cheap sugar on the world market.
3630	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The reform has caused job cuts at refineries and forced many farmers out of growing sugar beet and sugar cane.
3631	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	Under the old system, production was supported by generous EU subsidies and import tariffs that guaranteed and inflated price for sugar.
3633	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	EU sugar prices are more than three times higher than the global market rate.
3634	APW_ENG_20070129.0494.LDC2009T13	The EU also pays out export subsidies to get millions of tons of sugar off its market every year.

5534	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
5535	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
5541	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Scientists say loud sonar can damage marine mammal brains and ears.
5543	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been fighting the Navy's sonar training, said the group would challenge Bush's exemption.
5546	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
5548	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Much is still unknown about how sonar affects whales and other marine mammals.
5549	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.
5550	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead said exercises with sonar train sailors to detect quiet submarines that might threaten its ships.

5562	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"When you add the high cost of home insurance to the high cost of housing, you're going to cripple the market and eventually the state," said Harvey Baumann, a retired surgeon from Wellfleet.
5564	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Premiums have been rising quickly in those areas because a handful of little-known companies that use computer models to forecast the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes have dramatically raised their damage estimates.
5567	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Insurers, in turn, have increased premiums to offset higher reinsurance costs and set aside money for future hurricanes.
5569	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	State officials Friday said 30,000 homeowners on the Cape have been dropped by their insurers since 2004.
5570	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Nearly all of them have migrated to the Fair Plan, which insures 41 percent of the homes on the Cape and islands.
5571	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	The Fair Plan, which operates as an independent company but is financially backed by all of the state's home insurers, has also become the state's largest home insurer, with 13.5 percent of the total market.
5578	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	Jane Logan, an insurance broker from Sandwich, said she doesn't understand why rates are so much higher on the Cape than in Boston, which is also on the water.
5582	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"I worry that all of these models, though well-intentioned, are biased upward in the states where events are fewest and actual data therefore most sparse," Stone wrote.
5583	NYT_ENG_20070427.0238.LDC2009T13	"Rating agencies and the modelers themselves have more to lose by underestimating the risk in seldom-hit locations than overestimating it."

5591	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"We intend to continue to get as many people as possible out of Gaza over the next few days," Yassin said.
5594	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The closure trapped thousands of Palestinians who work and study abroad, and Israel has been letting them out several hundred at a time.
5595	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	The departure on Sunday at the Erez border crossing from Gaza into Israel was delayed by several dozen Palestinians who blocked the buses and demanded to be let out as well.
5597	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	His work visa in Saudi Arabia will expire at the end of this month if he can't make it back, he said, but he was not included on the list of those allowed to leave.
5602	APW_ENG_20071202.0604.LDC2009T13	"It's possible to have an effective, efficient mechanism that will get the human beings of Gaza and out of the enormous jail they are in."

5674	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Congressional Democrats pressed ahead Thursday with a bill to keep the U.S. government open for another week as lawmakers fashioned an omnibus spending bill and sought agreement among themselves and with the White House.
5677	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It would fund through Dec. 21 the 14 Cabinet departments whose budgets have yet to pass.
5678	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	It is expected the omnibus measure will pass by then, allowing Congress to finally adjourn for the year.

5691	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats' decision to largely hew to Bush's budget demand caps months of wrangling.
5692	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats initially crafted bills adding $23 billion (euro15.6 billion) above Bush's budget, devoting the funding to increases for domestic programs such as health research, education, grants to state and local governments and energy research.
5694	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	That effort collapsed after a White House issued a veto threat Saturday.

5718	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Unknown to most of the country, the two presidential contenders have been slugging away at each other on immigration issues -- through Spanish-language advertisements in crucial swing states where growing Latino populations could ultimately sway the election.
5723	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
5735	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.

5764	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	This time, the District of Columbia is taking a more studious approach.
5766	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	In addition, a Web site, shareyourdc.com, invites the city's 582,000 residents -- and anyone else, for that matter -- to propose slogans and take part in weekly polls.
5768	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	"This is an extensive and exhaustive search for what people in town are thinking and what people out of town are thinking."

5780	NYT_ENG_20070421.0091.LDC2009T13	Though the search for a slogan has captured the most attention, it is part of a larger "branding" initiative to spice up the city's image.

5799	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	Beijing banned smoking in taxis last October, a latest move toward a smoking- free Olympic Games in August.
5800	XIN_ENG_20080309.0162.LDC2009T13	In a regional ban enacted in 1995, the city put hospitals, schools, theaters, libraries, banks, shops and all means of public transport as smoking-free areas.

5809	AFP_ENG_20070301.0347.LDC2009T13	Investigators were not ruling out any motive for the crime, saying it may have been the work of thieves acting at the behest of an art collector or small-time robbers wanting to get their hands on some valuable loot.

6015	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A DOWNSIDE OF FUEL EFFICIENCY?
6017	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	America's growing love affair with energy-efficient cars is starting to take a toll on the nation's crumbling highways and roads.
6021	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
6022	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But now a panel chartered by Congress is looking for new ways to finance the system, and the answer could mean an increase at the pump for consumers who already pay 18.3 cents into the fund for each gallon of gas.
6023	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
6027	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
6034	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	After the commission files its report, legislators could decide to adopt its recommendations or use them as a guide for funding federal projects, said Chris Bonanti, special assistant to the administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration and staff liaison to the commission.
6039	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
6040	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
6041	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Predictions of trouble with the federal Highway Trust Fund surfaced in 2005.
6045	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	In 2006, 16.5 million cars were sold nationwide -- just 251,862 of them hybrids.
6047	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
6049	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
6052	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
6054	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Another possibility is to charge drivers by the mile, rather than the gallon -- similar to the way they pay for utilities.
6056	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.

6085	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It is relatively unusual for this meeting to highlight alternative therapies, but doctors here said that might be changing.
6086	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	They acknowledge that many of their patients are taking these supplements -- widely available in health food stores -- and asking them about them.
6089	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The shark cartilage clinical trial was mandated by Congress and was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
6091	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Charles Lu of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the trial's lead investigator, said there was reason to believe the cartilage might work.
6093	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And cutting off the blood supply to tumors has already been proven effective with other drugs.
6094	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But in the trial, those who received the shark cartilage extract lived a median of 14.4 months, meaning that half the patients had died by that point.
6095	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Those who got a placebo had a median survival of 15.6 months.
6096	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The trial involved 384 patients in the United States and Canada with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
6099	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That study, led by scientists at Duke University Medical Center, involved 161 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to have their prostates removed.
6100	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	After the glands were removed about a month later, the tumors were studied.
6101	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	It was found that the tumors of the men who had taken the flaxseed had been growing about 30 percent to 40 percent more slowly than for those who did not.
6102	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The ginseng study suggested that the herb might help fight fatigue, which is common in people with cancer.
6104	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	About one quarter of the patients who took one of the two higher doses of powdered extract of ginseng root, either 1,000 or 2,000 milligrams a day, reported that their fatigue had become "moderately better" or "much better."
6105	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	That contrasted with only one 10th of those who took either a smaller amount of ginseng or a placebo.
6108	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	And the quality and quantity of active ingredients in the ginseng supplements can vary.
6113	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The treatment also helped patients live longer.
6116	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
6125	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	That shift has gotten the attention of the nation's retailers, as they look to Hanukkah as a way to expand the gift-giving market.
6126	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Companies like Disney have developed products such as Mickey Mouse-themed dreidels.

6134	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	The potential "Christmasification" of Hanukkah, which usually falls in December, has some traditionalists worried.
6136	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"I've encountered two schools of thought," said Joseph Krakoff, Rabbi at Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Southfield.

6155	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	"The gift- giving isn't religious anymore."
6159	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Religious-themed toys "sell very, very well," Plotnik said.
6161	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	Krakoff, the Rabbi in Southfield, said he sees a potential silver lining in the commercialization of Hanukkah.
6168	NYT_ENG_20071205.0169.LDC2009T13	This year, it began at sundown on Tuesday and will end at sundown on Dec. 12.

6373	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
6374	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
6375	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas had earlier denied it had diverted money from the electricity company after it seized control of Gaza two months ago and said it would provide guarantees that the utility would function independently.
6377	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
6378	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
6380	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
6381	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	He said the fuel cuts were "the result of the illegal takeover of control electricity company by the Hamas putschists, and the collecting of citizens' (electricity) bills to pay members of its militia."
6383	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Palestinians have been split into two separate entities since Hamas routed security forces loyal to Abbas from Gaza on June 15, with the Western-shunned Islamists running the coastal strip and the Western-backed president ruling the occupied West Bank.

6440	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
6442	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	More investment is needed in agriculture but the government's agrarian reform effort -- assuming control of vast farmlands and offering them to poor farmers -- has made traditional producers reluctant to invest, he said.

6456	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run again in 2012.

6481	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	Microsoft worked with Sabi as part of an IP Ventures program that licenses propriety technology to startups in exchange for equity stakes in firms.
6484	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	They set out to create a computer game for children that bolsters reading skills along with creative expression.
6485	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"Out of that came Living Ink, which we hope delights children in that what they draw comes to life and they interact with it," Johnson said.
6489	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"It's a dying field," Johnson said.
6490	AFP_ENG_20081113.0621.LDC2009T13	"I see it as Sabi's technology addressing a gap in the market," said Sharieff Mansour, director of Microsoft's IP Ventures Program.

6498	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European Commission was to present plans Wednesday to limit CO2 emissions from new cars after weeks of delays due to divisions over how much the car industry should sacrifice for cleaner air.
6502	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	A further 10 grammes would be cut through requirements on tyre, equipment and fuel makers to improve air-conditioning efficiency, tyre pressure monitoring and gear shift indicators while increasing the use of biofuels and other measures.
6506	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The commission is aiming to present by the end of the year formal legislation that will then have to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.
6507	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	The European car industry is up in arms about the proposals, which it says could force them to relocate production elsewhere.
6508	AFP_ENG_20070207.0194.LDC2009T13	"Putting the burden of reducing CO2 emissions mainly on the shoulders of the car industry means choosing the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy for society," the ACEA European car industry association said in a statement.

6566	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Is it more valuable to invest in a medium-size bag in a bright fun color than a huge blah tote?
6567	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): It really depends on you and your schlepping needs.
6572	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	One thing to note in the back pain category: These bags are often fairly heavy on their own because of the structure and or/hardware involved in their design.
6573	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	I once purchased a Luella bag online and had to return it -- the chunky hardware and stiff leather meant it was a no-go for my back, even when empty.

6589	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Also, should my accessories be understated and neutral, like golds and browns?
6592	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): Some answers, in order:
6593	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	1.
6595	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Velvet might be a bit much with leopard print, but you could always try a thin, dressy wool or (faux) fur.
6596	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	2.
6600	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Bare legs and open-toe shoes are perfectly acceptable.
6603	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Can I wear it as a dress if I wear something underneath it with tights, or should I pair it with jeans?
6604	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	A (D'Amato): You could try a dress if it's a slinky, Calvin Klein/Helmut Lang-type sheath style, cut from a thin T-shirt fabric.
6605	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Any dress with a more structured fabric or built-in details such as embroidery, elaborate pintucking, etc., will look lumpy under the cardigan.
6607	LTW_ENG_20080109.0112.LDC2009T13	Yes, I know that last suggestion is just (ital) so (end ital) last year, but you gotta get the proportion right here.

6746	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Martina Hingis said Thursday she has been accused of testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon, and then announced her retirement from professional tennis.
6747	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
6755	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
6759	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	On March 31, 1997, Hingis became the youngest female player ever to lead the world rankings.
6761	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She is currently ranked No. 19.
6764	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Both were banned for three months and ordered to return prize money and forfeit rankings points.
6765	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Others have tested positive for a variety of banned substances.
6767	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She said she was "shocked and appalled" when notified that her urine sample came back positive after the loss to Granville.
6768	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.
6769	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.
6770	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I only know that if I were to try to hit the ball while in any state of euphoria, it simply wouldn't work.
6771	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I would think that it would be impossible for anyone to maintain the coordination required to play top class tennis while under the influence of drugs.
6772	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	And I know one other thing -- I would personally be terrified of taking drugs."
6776	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.
6781	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Widmer said the test was on June 29 but that Hingis heard about the positive result in mid-September and the positive 'B' sample two or three weeks later.
6782	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She has great angst over this," Widmer said.
6783	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"She is heartbroken.
6787	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"However, it is important to remember that in the area of anti- doping, all players are presumed innocent until proven otherwise," Scott said.
6788	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Referring to her retirement, he said, "Martina Hingis is a tremendous champion and a fan favorite the world over.
6792	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"We deeply regret that Martina Hingis ended her outstanding career under the circumstances of such accusations."

6813	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
6816	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"This place has gone from being an area in which you risked your life to something approaching pleasurable," said Ramon Martinez, a waiter at a restaurant on the boulevard for the last four years.
6817	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
6818	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Citing morgue records, newspapers here reported 265 killings last month, which would make it one of the deadliest in the city's recorded history.
6823	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Before the efforts began to restrict them, the city had about 150,000 of these vendors, according to Cedice, a research organization.
6827	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Along Sabana Grande, whose name refers to a region of savannas and tabletop mesas in southern Venezuela, the facades of Art Deco apartments remain crumbling or covered in grit.
6828	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Squatters have occupied some abandoned buildings.
6829	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But the police are more visible, and mimes and street musicians now attract growing crowds.
6830	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	A few reminders of the boulevard's past survive, like Suma, a cavernous bookstore, and the open-air Gran Cafe.
6833	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
6835	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
6839	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
6840	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Sabana Grande has exceptional importance in the urban fabric of Caracas," said Marcos Negron, a prominent architect here.
6841	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's one of the few areas where different social classes can mingle with each other outside."
6846	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
6848	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
6849	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
6850	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The vendors say promises of government loans have gone unmet.
6851	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
6852	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."
6853	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Still, many residents seem delighted that Sabana Grande, and perhaps even a tidied-up Caracas, may have a place in Chavez's revolution.
6856	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Officials even organized a small Carnival celebration on Sabana Grande this year, though it paled in comparison with Carnivals of decades past in Aponte's opinion.

7043	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	More than half of the force, drawn from 37 nations, is made up of contributions from the United States, with 14,000 troops, and Britain, which has deployed 5,200 personnel, according to official figures released Wednesday.
7044	AFP_ENG_20070208.0323.LDC2009T13	Until NATO took command in 2003, the leadership of ISAF had rotated among different nations every six months.

8480	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	On Friday, McCain urged a crowd of skeptical supporters at a town hall forum in this Minneapolis suburb to be respectful of his rival for the presidency despite their deep policy differences with Obama.
8483	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"I want everyone to be respectful, and let's be sure we are.
8489	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"He's a decent family man, a citizen who I just happen to have serious differences with on fundamental questions."
8490	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	His comments came a day after an angry crowd at a Wisconsin rally shouted epithets about the Democratic nominee, pumped their fists angrily in the air and catcalled repeatedly when Obama's name was mentioned.
8491	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Several called him a "socialist," and many flipped their middle finger as a press bus drove by.
8492	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	McCain appeared determined to respond Friday, saying that he respects Obama and quieting the boos only by saying that "if I didn't think I would be one heck of a better president, I wouldn't be running."
8495	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The narrator in the ad says Obama "lied" about his relationship with Ayers and accuses the Democrat of "blind ambition, bad judgment."
8496	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Later, the McCain campaign hosted a conference call with John Murtagh, a target of a bombing linked to Ayers's group, in which Murtagh accused Obama of lying "about the nature and extent of that relationship."
8498	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Campaigning in Ohio, Obama accused McCain of "riling up a crowd by stoking anger and division" and said the negative campaigning will backfire.

8503	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	The attacks on Obama's character came as the both candidates offered new proposals to address the steep drop in the stock market and the effects of the ongoing fiscal crisis on Wall Street.
8504	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	Obama proposed a menu of tax cuts and loans for small businesses, a temporary program he said is needed to help "Main Street" and complement what has already been done for major financial institutions.

8510	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	"Barack Obama has given $832,000 within the last year to an organization that is a front group for ACORN."
8512	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	It says ACORN stands accused of "massive voter fraud" and says "Obama's ties to ACORN run long and deep.
8513	LTW_ENG_20081011.0097.LDC2009T13	... They even endorsed him for president."

8869	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
8870	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There still is room only for four people in the two-door model, but the front seats now have 4.6 inches more hip room and 5.1 inches more shoulder room.
8873	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	With the four-door model, though, you can put three people in the back seat, and there is still decent cargo space behind it -- 46.4 cubic feet.
8874	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The four-door has a 116-inch-wheelbase versus 95.4 inches for the standard-length Wrangler, and it's 20.6 inches longer.

9025	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	It was a transmitted copy of Michael Vick's federal indictment.
9026	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The date was July 17, 2007.
9027	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	The football team on which Blank had lavished so much money and care was about to unravel as completely as any football team ever has.
9028	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	One year later, the Falcons owner speaks of 2007 as "the season that never ended.
9029	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Every day there was another twist to the story - there was the Michael Vick story, and then there was the Bobby Petrino story.
9033	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Within five months, Blank would find himself without both the quarterback he'd supported and befriended - some say coddled - and the head coach he'd hired for the express purpose of maximizing the quarterback's singular skills.
9034	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Blank regards 2007 as "another reminder that even though you work hard to try to build a roster of players capable of handling the pressures of being a professional athlete both on and off the field," the work carries no guarantee.
9035	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Of Vick, he says: "On the football field, he could cope."
9036	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would Petrino's system and guidance have enabled this quarterback to realize his massive potential?
9037	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"Clearly the answer we felt was, 'Yes.'
9039	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Early indications were encouraging.
9040	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Vick's offseason workouts led to in-house speculation that the Falcons could average 30 points a game, a prognostication that would have left them second to New England in scoring.
9042	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	What if, Blank is asked, Petrino had had Vick at his disposal and the Falcons would have started 4-3 instead of 1-6?
9043	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Would the grumbling about Petrino's methods have been silenced?
9046	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	We would have had to win a lot of games for (pacification) to take place."
9047	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	For the owner, what was the nadir of the season without end?
9050	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	Watching Vick address the media after pleading guilty?
9052	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"It was the day (Aug. 24) we received the document," says Blank, referring to Vick's pre-plea statement of facts.
9053	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	"A lot had been speculation up to then.
9054	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... Even after the indictment, Michael was still saying, 'I'm innocent
9055	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	you'll find that out.'
9056	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... The reality was that what Michael had been saying was not true.
9058	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	About Vick: "People say we shouldn't have supported the quarterback that much, but what about New England (with Tom Brady)?
9064	NYT_ENG_20080716.0084.LDC2009T13	... There'll be a lot of energy, a lot of discipline.

9080	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	District Attorney Kate Hogan had said a more serious charge of criminal negligence was not supportable because there was not enough evidence to show the operators knew the boat would capsize.
9082	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	"It's over," he said outside court.
9084	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	At least nine civil lawsuits are pending over the drownings.
9086	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	A grand jury heard conflicting testimony from survivors -- some said there was no wake, others said it was 6 to 8 inches (20.32 centimeters).
9088	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The Ethan Allen was certified to carry 48 passengers plus two crew, according to weight limits that have since been modified.
9089	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	There were 48 people on the boat -- including Paris -- when it capsized, but federal investigators said the boat should not have been certified to carry that many people.
9090	APW_ENG_20070326.0942.LDC2009T13	The boat's passenger capacity was calculated when it was manufactured in 1966, but modifications over the years made it less stable and its capacity should have been slashed to 14 people, the NTSB reported.

9107	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	While models such as sportscars or family minivans target segments of the population, auto companies generally avoid producing models aimed at narrow niche markets because they usually don't sell in numbers.
9110	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Here, young women are extremely powerful in setting trends, and the culture of cute is so prevalent grown men aren't embarrassed about dangling little mascots from cell phones.
9114	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Even the advertising for Pino is tailored to women who are about 20 years old.
9116	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	The TV ads also tell a similar story.
9117	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Nissan marketing manager Miwa Ishii says one goal for Pino is to court young drivers to the Nissan brand with hopes they'll move on to buy more expensive models in the future.
9118	APW_ENG_20070320.0179.LDC2009T13	Ishii said the Net store Nissan opened especially for Pino goodies is aimed at attracting online shoppers, who tend to live in areas far from the glitzy stores of Tokyo and other cities -- exactly the demographics of those who buy minicars.

9247	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
9250	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
9251	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Their research may seem light- hearted in an era when so much money and emphasis is given to studying science and technology.
9252	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor has real-life implications.
9255	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It also can have the opposite effect.
9259	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	His students paid more attention to a funny paragraph than to a bunch of sentences.
9261	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are both literature professors, and the study fit with their love of language.
9267	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen keeps a stack of index cards handy so he can jot down anything funny that he reads or hears.
9268	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Once a year, the couple attends an academic humor conference where about 300 academics from around the world give humor presentations.
9269	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Talking about humor is not always sidesplitting.
9270	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nilsens approach humor the same way an academic researches Elizabethan studies or a biologist examines the inner workings of a cell.

9278	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
9279	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Some people think the only type of humor is the type they use," Alleen Nilsen said.
9282	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	In their research, the Nilsens have put together 11 basic types of humor.
9283	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They range from "superiority," which includes jokes that put down Congress, to "hostility," which can be perceived as hate speech, depending on the audience.
9285	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	An example is: "Sign on a garbage truck: Our business is picking up."

9293	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
9295	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.
9301	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The most successful administrators were the ones who made spontaneous jokes that carried underlying compliments.
9302	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	People who were witty enough to get a laugh were much more persuasive in getting people to agree to their way of thinking, she said.
9303	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One spontaneous type of humor that often comes up in business meetings is what the Nilsens call "hot potato humor."
9304	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	One person makes a joke or clever remark about something that occurs in the meeting.
9306	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
9307	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"The people who laugh together bond," Alleen Nilsen said.
9308	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Making fun of one's self also is fairly safe.
9309	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."
9310	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make people aware of how important humor is in communication.

9652	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua)
9653	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Two suspects were arrested for their alleged involvement in two arson cases in the recent Lhasa riots which led to the deaths of two innocent victims, China's Ministry of Public Security said here on Tuesday.
9654	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The two men, both 27 years old, are named Tanzen and Losang Gyaltsen, respectively, according to a report from the Tibet Autonomous Region public security bureau.
9656	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Around 2 p.m. on March 14, Tanzen allegedly participated in such criminal activities as randomly assaulting passersby, vandalizing properties, looting and arson in the neighborhood of Duosengge Road in the Tibetan capital.
9657	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He set fire to several shops and used a lighter to burn pants in a garment store named Playboy.
9659	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	On the same day, Losang Gyaltsen set fire to a pants store called Hongyu on the Youth Road in Lhasa.
9662	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Wu said an investigation of the two was still underway.
9664	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	According to the ministry spokesman, apart from the cases already known to the public, six more people were found to have been killed in the March 14 riots.
9665	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	They are:
9667	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Lhapa Tsering, male, 30, Tibetan ethnic group, from Lhasa, Tibet.
9670	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Another two males killed in the riots have not yet been identified.
9673	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	Sufficient evidence showed that the March 14 Lhasa violence was part of the "Tibetan People's Uprising Movement" plotted by the Dalai Lama clique, according to the spokesman.
9674	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The "movement" aimed to create a crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities in Tibet, Wu said.
9675	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	He said that police have captured the primary suspects who allegedly organized, planned and participated in the violence on March 14 in Lhasa.
9677	XIN_ENG_20080401.0263.LDC2009T13	The capture had led to the discovery of a domestic network of an official from the "security ministry" of the Dalai Lama clique, Wu revealed.
9683	APW_ENG_20080810.0857.LDC2009T13	Hua Huilin said they were taken away in separate cars by security agents, whom his brother recognized from previous encounters.

9738	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	In corners of the state, once-reliable well-water supplies have become intermittent in recent years, with homeowners blaming local developers or mining operations or a bottling operation.

9755	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
9756	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.

9768	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	A 2007 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group, pointed out that, although much is not known about exactly how ground water moves through geological formations, it "typically moves very slowly."

9851	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern," left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time.
9852	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
9854	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory.
9855	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated," the central bank said.
9856	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The biggest question was how policymakers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
9858	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
9859	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier.
9863	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	"What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates," said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.

9871	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	The effort to reshape attitudes among the growing detainee population is aimed at addressing a problem that has vexed U.S. troops in Iraq for the past four years: Military detention facilities have served as breeding grounds for extremist views, transforming some prisoners into hard-core insurgents, according to military analysts.
9872	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Stone said he wants to identify "irreconcilables" -- those detainees whose views cannot be moderated -- and "put them away" in permanent detention facilities.
9874	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	After reassessments and interrogations, Stone said, some detainees are recommended for release.
9875	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	"If a detainee is an imperative security risk ... then I'm going to reduce that risk and I'm going to replace that destructive ideology," he said.

9881	LTW_ENG_20070919.0152.LDC2009T13	Other initiatives at the facilities include vocational training and basic education programs for about 7,000 detainees.

10089	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	John McCain's second visit to Iowa in less than a month is heartening Republicans who say it is proof their presidential candidate intends to compete for the Midwestern state, despite polls showing him behind Democrat Barack Obama.
10090	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Democrats counter that McCain's event Tuesday in Des Moines shows he cannot be elected president without winning in states where he trails his rival.
10094	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	The visit is McCain's second in less than two weeks.
10098	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	That Republican optimism comes despite voter registration trends that show Democrats have gained a more than a 100,000-person edge in Iowa.
10099	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Still, the last two presidential elections were decided by razor-thin margins of 1 percentage point.
10101	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University, said McCain could still improve his standing in Iowa.
10105	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"I have never seen an election that has had this many violent mood swings," he said.
10109	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	"Housing and mortgages are at the root of this crisis," McCain said.
10111	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	McCain aides say Iowa has made the list of competitive states he is focusing on.
10112	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Iowa has seven electoral votes
10121	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, said McCain's problem in Iowa has less to do with organization than where he is on the issues, such as a new farm bill and incentives for alternative fuels.
10122	APW_ENG_20080930.0927.LDC2009T13	Both are popular throughout the Midwest, and McCain opposed both.

10173	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Both the House and Senate passed bills that would drop Virginia from the federal education program unless the U.S. Education Department waives some requirements.

10178	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, D, has said he won't support the measure, and the state board, while wanting more flexibility, doesn't favor a state withdrawal.
10179	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	They undoubtedly are mindful that Virginia would stand to lose an estimated $300 million a year, a hole in the state budget that couldn't be tolerated.

10184	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Most notable was its ill-advised rebellion over the testing of children with limited proficiency in English.
10185	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	The state eventually backed down in the face of a loss of federal funds, but the reluctance to hold all students to the same standards says much about why No Child Left Behind is needed.
10187	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	Until No Child Left Behind came along, school districts were able to mask the low achievement of poor and minority students, there was no recourse for parents and children in failing schools, and no one was held accountable.
10188	LTW_ENG_20080307.0008.LDC2009T13	In passing the measures, lawmakers talked about sending a message to Washington.

10800	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	A few, like Biogen Idec, are setting up corporate incubators.
10801	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical giant, recently committed to spending up to $10 million a year on a new biotech incubator in La Jolla, Calif., near San Diego, and is considering setting up another incubator in Massachusetts or another biotech hot spot.

10813	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But Fuchs said it's important to find good matches.
10816	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Fuchs said Biogen Idec plans to give each company in its incubator between $3 million and $10 million in seed funding over several years, dedicated office and laboratory space, administrative support, and technical expertise.

10863	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The growing sense of urgency about instability in the housing and financial sectors may pressure both McCain and Obama to flesh out economic policies that have been vague or overshadowed by a blizzard of character attacks and negative campaigning.
10864	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	The past week, for example, has included bickering over the McCain campaign's charge that Obama was making a sexist reference to Palin in talking about "putting lipstick on a pig."

10870	LTW_ENG_20080916.0116.LDC2009T13	Such language is sometimes interpreted as a caution that too much regulation will damage Wall Street's standing as an economic powerhouse.

11071	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Champ Car ushers in a new era with the standing start
11073	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Justin Wilson admits he's going to have to pay a bit more attention now that Champ Car has adopted the standing start.
11077	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	But Sunday at Portland, the series introduced standing starts -- the Formula One standard -- where the drivers start from a dead stop on a grid.
11078	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	When the last of a bank of lights above the track goes out, the drivers take off.
11080	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's quite a buildup in tension because you have a few moments where it's very quiet and nothing's happening and then all of the sudden everyone's on full throttle and they drop their clutch."
11084	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's a fine line between the perfect start and a total disaster," he said.
11085	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Many drivers already had experience with the procedure.
11086	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	The Champ Car's developmental Atlantic series introduced standing starts last season, so rookie Graham Rahal knew what he was doing, for the most part.
11087	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"It's much more difficult to do the starts in Champ Car because there's so much more power," Rahal said.
11092	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"In Formula One the computers control the standing start, so the driver has no excuse if he messes up the start," explains Doornbos.
11093	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"Here it is all driver.
11094	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	If you mess up, you stall and have a big problem.
11095	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I did three or four and it went quite well.
11096	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It is just finding a strategy that works for you."
11097	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	Despite the concerns, the start at Portland International Raceway went smoothly -- even though heavy rains earlier in the race weekend briefly had Champ Car considering whether to go back to the rolling start.
11098	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'm just happy my dark visions didn't happen and nobody stalled, which is good," said Bourdais, who won at Portland.
11100	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	It means I was a little more pessimistic than the truth.
11105	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I like doing them both," Wilson said.
11106	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	"I'd like to see a mixture of both throughout the season.
11107	APW_ENG_20070613.1615.LDC2009T13	I think that's the best way.

11111	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm's trip to the Beijing Olympics was cleared by the International Gymnastics Federation on Tuesday following his warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
11112	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	FIG said it will not appeal Hamm's punishment by the USADA, which announced on July 3 that Hamm was warned for a May 24 positive test for glucocorticosteroid, a cortisone-like anti-inflammatory.
11113	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	The drug is allowed if an athlete gets a therapeutic use exemption, but Hamm had failed to do that.
11114	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee already had said the warning did not affect Hamm's spot on the team for the Beijing Games.
11116	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Paul Hamm had a broken right hand and strained left rotator cuff.
11117	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	Morgan Hamm said he got the anti-inflammatory shot on May 2 from his doctor after taping, ultrasound and other therapies failed to reduce the pain and swelling in his left ankle.
11118	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	After being notified of the positive test, which occurred the second day of the U.S. championships, he sent USADA his medical records and letters from his doctor and physical therapist.
11121	APW_ENG_20080729.0848.LDC2009T13	But USAG and the USOC reviewed all the results from nationals and the Olympic trials, and said Hamm would still have made the team.

11137	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	The Geelong Cats topped regular season standings by 12 points with a 19-win, one-loss record to secure the minor premiership, and confirmed their rating as the best team in the AFL with Saturday's historic win over the 2004 champions.
11138	APW_ENG_20070929.0276.LDC2009T13	"We were the best side all year and we thoroughly deserve this," Geelong midfielder Joel Corey said.

11165	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	After a fourth-wicket stand of 144 between Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo, Steyn struck with the second new ball of the innings, dismissing Bravo leg before wicket for 75 soon after tea.
11167	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"We fought well," Bravo said.
11169	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Despite winning the series, South Africa dropped two places to fourth spot in test rankings, the International Cricket Council said.
11172	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Shortly after making his century, Samuels fell to a delivery from Steyn which clipped his off stump.
11173	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	The dismissal signaled a collapse for West Indies, and Steyn ripped through the rest of the tail.
11175	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Steyn was named man of the series for his 20 wickets in the series at an average of 19.10.
11178	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Makhaya Ntini then induced a loose shot from Ganga who edged a simple catch to Kallis at second slip for 11.
11179	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock came into the attack and had Runako Morton leg before wicket for 37.
11180	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Morton did not offer a shot on a ball that cut back in on him.
11181	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	Pollock, 34, later announced it was his last test.
11182	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"It's great to be able to finish my test career on my home ground, and especially in a match where the guys played so well," said Pollock, who said he would retire from international cricket after the one-day series against West Indies that finishes next month.
11183	APW_ENG_20080112.0749.LDC2009T13	"But with Dale bowling so well, they don't need me," added Pollock, who took a record 421 test wickets for South Africa at an average of 23.11.

11390	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
11392	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The airline industry had fought such a requirement, contending that it would be too slow and costly.
11393	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	When Republicans controlled Congress, the industry succeeded in getting the legislation blocked.
11396	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey put a video of a triumphant House floor speech on his website, proclaiming "After four years, Representative Markey wins his fight to ensure 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger planes."
11401	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The only difference is that "known shippers" merely register with the TSA and do not have to meet security standards.

11415	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Despite Markey's calls for action, the Bush administration had been unwilling to impose such a regulation on its own, and Republican leaders in Congress had blocked Markey's attempts to enact a law requiring such screening.
11420	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Many supporters of the bill assumed that meant that individual shipments of cargo would have to be screened in the same manner as checked bags, which are either X-rayed or physically inspected.
11421	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The statute says the TSA must require more than a simple check of a shipment's paperwork against a database of registered shippers.
11425	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	He said the agency is also considering whether to require tamper-evident seals on cargo shipments.
11428	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Instead, it pointed a reporter to a little-noticed statement put out by its president when Congress passed the bill.
11429	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
11430	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"Congress prudently adopted legislation that incorporates a multi-layered approach to cargo screening, balancing the need for enhanced security with the free flow of commerce," May said.
11434	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.
11441	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers in one of the inquiries are expected to release their findings Friday.
11443	APW_ENG_20081010.0115.LDC2009T13	Since then, the report says, the matter has been muddled with innuendo, rumor and politics.
11448	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The artillery bombardment sent clouds of white smoke rising from the camp, and the shelling ignited fires inside it, spewing black smoke.
11449	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The militants have barricaded themselves in the camp's residential neighborhoods of narrow, winding streets and apartment buildings.
11450	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	However, reports on the ground indicated the army did not penetrate deep into the camp, but limited its advance to outer neighborhoods militants use for sniper fire against army positions.
11457	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants also have been killed before Friday's fighting.
11459	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	At one point Friday, a significant decrease in the shelling, accompanied by a barrage of machine gun fire from armored carriers and exchanges of automatic rifle fire, indicated the troops were in close combat with the militants.
11461	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	The security officials said the army had seized or controlled by fire the Samed and Khan main positions of the militants on the camp's northern edge.
11469	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"It seems they have destroyed those positions."
11473	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	"They are in very well-fortified positions," he said of the militants, adding troops were coming under sniper fire.
11477	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	Military officials would not comment on the movement and journalists were ordered further back from the camp.
11478	APW_ENG_20070601.0964.LDC2009T13	But a statement by the army command said troops came under fire from the militants and that the army was "responding with accurate and decisive fire to deter them" while also avoiding civilian casualties.

11591	NYT_ENG_20080508.0246.LDC2009T13	The prelude may have been designed to convey power, but these days Cohen stands on shaky political ground.

12433	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai tried on Thursday to reassure security chiefs who vowed a week ago not to serve anyone but Mugabe, according to a source close to the opposition leader.
12437	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The letter promises generous retirement packages for those unwilling to serve an MDC government.

12463	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe, who appeared on state television Thursday for the first time since the elections, was said to be pondering conflicting advice from his advisers on whether to quietly cede power or face a run-off, both humiliating prospects for the 84-year-old president.

14136	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	The shuttered air base in northern Poland, which dates back to World War II, is a likely site for 10 interceptors for the U.S. missile defense program, a plan Washington says is necessary to counter potential attacks from so-called rogue states.
14138	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"If they build the missile defense base here, it'll be a magnet and the first place the Russians will shoot their missiles," said Tadeusz Krajnik, a 55-year-old retired air force technician who lives in one of the brightly-colored Communist-era apartment blocs next to the base which has been closed since 1999.
14142	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Russia, however, fiercely opposes the plan, arguing that such an installation so close to its territory would threaten its security.

14147	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.

14153	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	Some local residents say the base -- covering some 400 hectares, with a 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) runway and 28 hangars -- could better serve local interests if it where transformed into a small airport for business and tourism.
14155	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"Whereas I think that building the base here will in a sense block off and isolate our region."
14159	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	"From my point of view, it would be better if the base wasn't built here, but I'm aware that if the base is needed for international security, we aren't going to oppose it," says Chmiel.

14894	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"Pending Security Council guidance, there might be a need for UNMIK to adjust its operational deployment to developments and changes on the ground in a manner consistent with the operational framework established under resolution 1244," he said.
14895	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The UN chief said despite "a number of serious security incidents," the overall security situation in Kosovo in recent months "remained calm though tense."

14908	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of anonymity after Washington set the deadline.
14909	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"We're in no rush" to have a response "in the next 24 hours."
14913	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Losing My Jihadism
14915	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
14920	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
14922	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
14926	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
14928	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
14931	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
14933	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Viewing modern education as corrupt and immoral, I joined a circle of scholars who taught the Islamic sciences in the classical way, just as they had been taught 1,200 years ago.
14936	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
14937	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
14939	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
14943	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I learned of Islamic teachers who molested their students.
14945	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In 1999, when I was working as an imam at a Riyadh mosque, I happened upon two books that had a profound influence on me.
14950	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That article landed me in the center of a storm.
14952	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
14953	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
14954	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
14957	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
14958	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
14959	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
14961	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I tried to give a new interpretation to the verses that call for enmity between Muslims and Christians and Jews.
14962	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I wrote that they do not apply to us today and that Islam calls for friendship among all religions.
14965	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
14966	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, the paper came under great pressure to ban my writing.
14968	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
14969	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
14972	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I remembered an incident when the prophet told a Bedouin who didn't know how to pray to let go of the verses and simply to think of God and get closer to Him by repeating, ``God is good, God is great.''
14973	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
14974	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
14975	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
14976	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Within days, a fatwa was posted online, calling me an infidel and saying that I should be killed.
14977	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
14978	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
14979	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	That earned me a fatwa from the mufti of Saudi Arabia declaring my infidelity.
14982	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
14990	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Ibn Taymiyya was an Islamic scholar from a hard-line Salafi sect who went through a spiritual crisis and came to believe that in time, God would close the gates of hell and grant all humans, regardless of their religion, entry to his everlasting paradise.

15007	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The contract jumped 91 cents Wednesday to settle at US$66.26 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly snapshot showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles were unchanged last week and refinery utilization fell.

15010	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The price has stayed above US$66 a barrel, "a strong level -- and the strong pricing is supported by the tight U.S. gasoline supply situation," Shum said.
15011	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Gasoline inventories were unchanged at 201.5 million barrels for the week ended June 8, the EIA report said.
15012	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Analysts had expected gas inventories to rise by 2 million barrels.
15015	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Most analysts say refineries should be using 94 percent to 95 percent of their capacity at this time of year.
15016	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Crude oil inventories rose by 100,000 barrels last week, when analysts had expected a 400,000-barrel decline.
15018	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	U.S. refiners reported an unusually high number of outages this spring, crimping gasoline supplies.
15022	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Geopolitical factors also continue to provide a floor for oil prices, he said.
15024	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	Calls for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output have also largely been ignored, with the cartel stressing that supplies are sufficient.
15025	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures lost 0.2 cent to US$1.9600 a gallon (3.8 liters) while natural gas prices gained 1.7 cents to US$7.625 per 1,000 cubic feet.

15033	APW_ENG_20071026.0364.LDC2009T13	A spokesman for the union said the motivation among the striking train drivers was still very strong and that GDL would announce at a news conference later Friday further plans regarding strikes next week.

15041	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The blackout comes at the urging of environmental activists seeking to call attention to energy waste -- and just hours before world scientists unveil a major report on Friday warning that the planet will keep getting warmer and presenting new evidence of humanity's role in climate change.
15048	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The second day of the Paris talks wound down Tuesday evening more or less on schedule, according to officials at UNESCO, the conference's host.
15049	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	There was little sign of the late-night wrangling among countries that marked previous reports.
15050	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The report must be unanimously approved by bureaucrats from more than 100 governments who can challenge the scientists' wording.
15052	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	The end result is a cautious document, many scientists say.
15055	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	But who knows, we've got two more days.
15057	APW_ENG_20070130.1375.LDC2009T13	An early draft of the report being released in Paris suggests it will contain stronger evidence of the human role in climate change and more specific predictions of rising temperatures and sea levels this century.

15106	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Tuesday suspended all fishing in areas affected by last week's San Francisco Bay oil spill, calling what was the area's worst spill in nearly two decades an "unbelievable human failure" and promising an investigation.
15107	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
15109	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"Then on top of it, it takes that long to react to the oil spill so by the time the next day comes around, the oil is all over the bay."
15110	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
15111	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
15121	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Commercial crab fishermen voted to ask for the delay Saturday.
15125	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
15126	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
15128	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
15129	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.
15131	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
15133	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.
15139	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	"They are in our custody now and our leadership will decide their fate."
15152	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"China's total failure to account for the massacre of June 4, 1989 casts a pall on its efforts to project a new image and continues to spawn more abuses," New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
15154	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims' families and detaining dissidents?"
15158	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	It remains one of the most sensitive political issues in China.
15159	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Human Rights Watch repeated its call for Beijing to overturn a decision labeling the incident a "counter-revolutionary rebellion" and to give fair and open trials to all those convicted over the protests.

15170	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Myanmar announced the complete end of its national convention here Monday, laying down all detailed basic principles for drafting a new state constitution.
15175	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Specifically, the country will pursue a multi-party democracy system politically, while adopting a market-oriented economic system economically.
15177	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
15180	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
15182	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
15183	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
15184	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
15189	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military government has announced the complete end of the constitutional national convention but did not mention the duration period to be taken for drafting the constitution and the time table about when the national referendum on the drafted constitution will be held.

15479	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	What's undermining the book industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing habits of devoted readers.
15480	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	In other words, it's all the fault of people like myself, who increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after their value to us is gone, sell them.

15488	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this?

15496	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Here's one example of how I casually wreak destruction.
15497	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	I was reading "Sylvia," an account by the late short-story master Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife.
15498	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon.
15500	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	But there were dozens of copies from resellers available online for as little as 1 cent, plus shipping.
15501	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping.
15502	NYT_ENG_20081227.0061.LDC2009T13	Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon -- whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three -- nor the author got a share.

15548	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	O.T. ISN ' T AS SIMPLE AS TELLING TIME
15549	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A woman in a Chicago workplace caused quite a stir recently when she submitted her time sheet.
15551	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Because the woman, Carla Bird, is an assistant at Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Studios, and because some seemingly jealous co-workers spread the word to the news media, her $32,000 payout was the talk of those who pay attention to workload for a living.

15562	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	When the Fair Labor Standards Act was first written, while FDR was president, it was fairly clear who was a worker and who was a manager, and who was a professional and who wasn't.

15574	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
15575	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Which leads to the question of "what counts toward overtime?"
15577	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Now you can do all that while sitting at your desk.
15578	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	So if you are spooning your yogurt and ordering from Amazon, you are on your lunch break, right?
15579	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But what if you get an IM from the boss?
15580	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Or an e-mail message from a client?
15581	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And you respond?
15582	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Are you working again?
15584	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	If you have to jump on every e-mail that you get then you're on call, and that isn't a lunch break."
15585	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What if that same message comes over a BlackBerry or cell phone when you are technically off the clock?
15590	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
15592	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	And while the people most likely to be working while commuting are exempt-category workers like managers, experts say, the need to bring the office onto the bus is creeping into the lives of workers qualified for overtime, too.
15593	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Robin Bond, founder of Transition Strategies, an employment law firm in Wayne, Pa., said: "If a nonexempt employee gets in his car and immediately gets on a conference call where his participation is required, or not stopped by management, that is work time."
15595	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	There are several reasons, all of which reveal much about the new realities of work.
15596	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
15597	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Of course, there are electronic records of work calls, and e-mail trails are time/date stamped, but the five minutes here, 15 minutes there don't often rise to the level of logged work time.

15603	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.
15605	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is unclear exactly what took place with Bird and Harpo, because she did not return phone calls, but her co-workers were quoted in The New York Post as suggesting that only because she was a favorite could she get away with filing for so much overtime.
15606	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Finally, experts say, there is the status factor.
15607	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Plaintiffs' lawyers have stopped being surprised by the fact that workers wrongly classified as "exempt" are reluctant to change their job title, because being a salaried manager, even at a loss of income, carries the intangible benefit of respect.

15829	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
15830	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
15831	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
15832	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	But this short-term fix is not enough.
15833	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Upgrading the air traffic control system is the real solution to America's air-travel woes.
15834	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
15836	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
15837	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The department's objectives are twofold.
15840	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
15842	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.

16305	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	Mbeki, who announced his resignation Sunday after pressure from the ANC, attempted to salvage his reputation in the Constitutional Court, as he challenged a court ruling which he says cost him his job as president.
16306	AFP_ENG_20080923.0500.LDC2009T13	In a September 12 ruling, judge Chris Nicholson dismissed a corruption case against Mbeki's political rival Jacob Zuma, hinting that Mbeki had interfered in the decision to prosecute his foe.

16704	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
16705	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
16708	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
16709	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"I do feel vindicated," he added.
16712	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Mann declared the case "a triumph of the little guy against the big guy.
16714	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Prop?t attorney Bruce Kaser declined to comment because the litigation is ongoing.
16718	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
16721	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
16724	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"We gave the jury a range of values, and whether it's coincidence or not, I don't know," Mann said.

16727	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
16728	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"Officially your copyright exists the second you create an image, but to protect that copyright, it has to be registered.
16729	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
16730	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	"The axiom that the copyright is created when the image is created means nothing."
16733	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The data spooked some pundits and Wall Street investors who had hoped that receding inflation could set the stage for a Fed rate cut sometime this year.
16735	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
16736	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
16738	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Fed's official forecast calls for core inflation to be in a range of 2.0 to 2.25 percent for 2007.
16743	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"If inflation becomes higher for some reason, then the Federal Reserve would have to respond to that by raising interest rates."
16748	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"We continue to expect consumer inflation -- as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures deflator (the Fed's preferred measure) -- to dip below the 2.0 percent mark in the second half of the year."
16750	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But according to Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors: "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed.
16754	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."

16775	AFP_ENG_20081221.0104.LDC2009T13	The army spokesman said militants had fired 19 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, wounding one person slightly and causing some damage.

16954	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Flyers right wing Joffrey Lupul picked up a loose puck at center ice and scored an empty-net goal with 33 seconds left to seal the victory.
16956	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
16957	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Shortly after Lupul's goal, as the crowd thundered its approval, the towering Philadelphia defenseman Derian Hatcher fought with Pittsburgh left wing Ryan Malone, knocking off Malone's helmet.
16959	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Because they had no other choice, the Flyers pierced holes in the Penguins' trapping defense, which had been as important to Pittsburgh's postseason success as Crosby or Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' other elite center.

17021	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known here as "nickel hunters."
17022	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	That effort has led indirectly to the latest scandal, which is the third this decade to occur in an administration led by the leftist Workers' Party.

17490	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
17492	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	He has issued a steady stream of signing statements, signaling his intent not to comply with more than 750 provisions of laws concerning national security and disclosure, most notably one that questioned Congress' authority to limit coercive interrogation tactics.
17495	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	"Unchecked and Unbalanced" contains little new reporting and is heavily indebted to the groundbreaking work of journalists like Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times, Dana Priest of The Washington Post and Charlie Savage of The Boston Globe.
17498	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	Equally devastating is their deconstruction of Bush administration lawyers' efforts to assert a doctrine of unfettered presidential prerogative.
17504	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	As Schwarz and Huq see it, the Bush White House's "broader efforts to seize unfettered control of national security policy and to eliminate the checks and balances imposed by Congress and the courts" is exemplified by its post 9/11 decision "to ignore legal constraints on torture."
17506	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In addition Justice Department lawyers undermined the spirit and purpose of anti-torture laws by promulgating a deliberately narrow definition of torture.
17509	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	For instance the authors observe that a presidential finding signed days after 9/11 gave the CIA sweeping new powers to disrupt terrorist activity and permission to kill, capture and detain members of Al Qaida anywhere in the world: powers, in the view of some intelligence officers, that included the implicit authority to create black sites (secret detention facilities outside the United States, where terrorism suspects could be held beyond the Bush's signing of a 2002 presidential order authorizing NSA surveillance in the homeland without a court- approved warrant, an order that effectively circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed by Congress in 1978.

17830	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Some are calling for a halt to the so-called "hot wines."
17831	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.
17833	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Still, big reds, many of which are highly rated by critics, have their champions.
17836	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	They linger on your palate when you're drinking them and that's what Napa is known for -- its big, chewy cabs," said Doug White, director of operations for the Vintner's Collective, a Napa tasting room specializing in boutique wineries.
17839	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You don't do that with a 15.5 percent or 16 percent alcohol wine," he added.
17840	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"You'd be lying on the floor."
17842	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
17844	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
17845	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.
17846	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	One way to have ripe fruit without high alcohol is to use various technologies available to pull alcohol out of wine.
17848	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The truth is that wine has already been affected by technology, from stainless steel tanks to sterile filtration, he said.
17850	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"It's a shame," he said, "because winemaking's just cooking."
17852	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The two are separated by distilling and the water is then put back into the wine.
17853	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	To arrive at just how much alcohol should be taken out, Vinovation uses a method they call "sweet spotting," to find the point where the wine is at a lower level of alcohol but still tastes good.
17854	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Fugelsang, who uses Vinovation when his wine comes in with too much alcohol, sees the technology as "another tool in the winemaker's chest," but he understands why others are reluctant to open up about adjusting alcohol levels.
17861	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I'm not forcing anyone to buy our wines -- we're selling everything," he points out.

17871	AFP_ENG_20080210.0023.LDC2009T13	That stance could increase pressure on moderate McCain to turn rightward, but also exacerbate the divisions in the party when it needs unity against the powerful Democrats.

17966	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Whether 2008's high prices will lure many farmers back to wheat is still a matter of debate.
17970	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Corn has even begun to make inroads in the western part of the state, where sparse rainfall and the short growing season traditionally have ruled out most crops except wheat, barley and oats.
17971	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Spurred by the availability of cheap coal for power and a local cattle industry that will buy the dry byproducts for feed, a new ethanol plant opened last year in Richardton, west of Bismarck, the capital.
17974	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	But wheat's biggest problem is susceptibility to disease, which has turned many farmers against it.
17976	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	After that, many farmers switched to new varieties of hybrid corn and genetically modified soybeans.
17978	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That produces strong financial incentives for the companies.
17980	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	In 2004, Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, shelved its research on a wheat plant that had been genetically modified to tolerate chemical weed killers.
17981	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The milling industry has been resistant to using such genetically modified wheats, so wheat plants have to be improved the old- fashioned way, by laboriously selecting those with the desired qualities in test plots.
17982	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is an expensive and time-consuming process.
17983	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	Even then, there is no assurance that farmers will buy the seed year after year.
17984	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	That is because of the nature of the wheat plant, an unusually complex organism originating in the Middle East thousands of years ago.
17987	LTW_ENG_20080430.0024.LDC2009T13	The upshot is that most wheat research is now consigned to public colleges with limited amounts of federal and state funds.

18090	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	When Alba talks, no matter what she's actually saying, it usually sounds like she's asking, "Does this come in a two?"

18242	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
18243	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident began with the pilot of one plane getting on the wrong radio frequency "and accepting instructions intended for another aircraft," Bergen said.
18244	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.
18246	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the controller was decertified and will be retrained.

18417	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	DES MOINES - GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, reeling under a negative TV ad campaign from rival Mitt Romney, said Monday he made a last-minute decision to pull an anti-Romney ad he had shipped to Iowa stations.
18418	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
18420	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
18422	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"But I'd like to be the first one that tries," Huckabee said, appealing to voters who say they are tired of negative ads despite the fact that history indicates they work.
18424	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
18425	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.

18434	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The ad was produced Sunday and shipped to Iowa stations to begin airing Monday.
18435	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.

18527	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
18529	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	No, Najat told the caller.
18530	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after hanging up, he wryly revealed the deeper truth about Kirkuk, combustible for its mix of ethnicities floating together on a sea of oil: The Kurds already control it.
18532	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
18535	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Beyond that, it demonstrates that despite a recent decline in violence, Iraq's unsettled ethnic and regional discord could still upend directives emanating from Baghdad and destabilize large regions of the country -- or even set off a civil war.
18536	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	This month, legislation in the national parliament to set the groundwork for crucial provincial elections collapsed in a bitter dispute over Kirkuk, as Arabs and Turkmens demanded that the Kurds be forced to cede some of their power here.
18537	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But with the Kurds having already consolidated their authority in Kirkuk, there seemed little chance -- short of a military intervention -- of that happening.
18541	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
18543	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' control over the security forces -- and their ability to use it for political purposes -- was evident three weeks ago, rival groups say, after a suicide bomber attacked Kurdish demonstrators, igniting a riot that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded.
18547	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
18549	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video, in which the guard says he was ordered to fire on the crowd, soon appeared on Kurdish television.
18556	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
18558	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The city's Arabs, said Khalil, "will not stay handcuffed by Kurdish actions."
18560	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing in Kurds.
18570	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
18576	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.
18577	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"Negotiations here are, 'You give me everything I want, and I will walk away happy,"' he said.
18578	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"It is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred."
18579	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
18583	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	It took only a few moments for the demonstrators to turn their fury on the Turkmens, whom they instantly blamed.
18589	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.

18625	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	With five races to go in the Chase, they are the only three drivers with a realistic shot at winning the title.
18626	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Gordon came into the race in a slump at Lowe's, having failed to finish each of his last five races here dating back to 2005.

18631	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
18633	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	But Gordon's car sputtered and Newman pulled into the lead, only to crash with three laps to go.
18635	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He dominated through the first 200 laps of the event.
18638	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.
18641	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He was battling in the top 10 much of the night until crashing into both Paul Menard's No. 15 Chevrolet and Kasey Kahne's No. 9 Dodge on a pit stop just past the midway point of the race.
18643	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Although Stewart finished seventh, he fell 198 points behind Gordon.

18856	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Federal Reserve, faced with a strongly rebounding economy, left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while repeating concerns about inflation.
18857	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The central bank voted to leave the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, at 5.25 percent, where it has been since last June.
18860	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The rate action was supported by a unanimous 11-0 vote of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members in Washington and regional bank presidents who meet eight times a year to set interest rates.
18863	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.

18867	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The statement also said that "reading on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time."
18869	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
18870	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Since the Fed's last meeting Dec. 12, the economic news has been uniformly good, with job growth stronger than expected, energy prices dropping and the overall economy navigating the rough waters of a severe housing slump.

19160	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
19161	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.

19167	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden's beard appears to have been dyed, a popular practice among Arab leaders, said Rita Katz, director of the SITE Institute, a Washington-based group that monitors terror messages.

19169	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement and photo appeared in a banner advertisement on an Islamic militant Web site where al-Qaida's media arm, Al- Sahab, frequently posts messages.

19171	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Such announcements are usually put out one to three days before the video is posted on the Web.
19173	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
19175	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
19178	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
19180	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
19185	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.

19750	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The Nasri brothers and thousands of young Tunisians like them epitomize the intersection of ideological currents and technological wizardry fueling Islamic extremism across North Africa.

19811	LTW_ENG_20071202.0013.LDC2009T13	The case became a national sensation, pitting a government wanting to show it was fighting terrorism against critics who claimed security forces were exaggerating Islamic threats and making arrests to impress the United States.

19843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
19844	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
19845	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
19847	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	A child who collapses is more likely to primarily have breathing problems -- and in that case, mouth-to-mouth breathing should be used.
19849	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In these cases, people need mouth-to-mouth to get air into their lungs and bloodstream.

19864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
19865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
19866	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.
19867	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"When people are honest, they're not going to do it," he said.

19880	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Goodall, a 49-year-old construction contractor, said he had been healthy and fit before the collapse, and there'd been no hint that he had clogged heart arteries.
19881	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was lucky," he said.

19927	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
19928	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
19929	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Perhaps never before have animals been so prominent on the sports landscape.

19941	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Public attitudes appear to have changed since then.
19943	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
19944	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."

19952	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
19955	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The LSU case represents perhaps PETA's most visible attempt to dissuade universities from using live mascots.

19963	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When LSU's previous tiger mascot died, PETA sent a letter to the school saying that large carnivores "suffer extremely" in captivity because they are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors such as running, climbing, hunting, establishing territory and choosing mates.
19964	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Most universities and all major professional teams use costumed humans, not live animals, as mascots, PETA said.

19981	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	When it does attend football games, the tiger will not be sedated or forced into its trailer, Baker said.
19982	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	And no one will be allowed to bang on the trailer or poke the animal in an attempt to make it roar, he said.
19983	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The previous tiger mascot "was obviously not stressed" in the stadium, Baker said, seeming almost to fall asleep as it circled the field.
19984	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The mascot always leaves the stadium before kickoff.

20074	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
20075	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
20079	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.
20081	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	When he plays, he makes a difference.
20082	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"He's been a big part of what we're doing," Bears coach Lovie Smith said Monday of Manning, who had five interceptions during the regular season and added a sixth Sunday in the fourth quarter off Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck.
20084	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.
20092	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.
20094	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I've got a kid.
20095	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	I'm married to a beautiful lady.
20096	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Because of the trouble I got in, that's why my life has changed, but I like the change."
20098	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	His circumstances have caused him to become a homebody.
20104	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"I miss some of the guys' parties that they're throwing," Manning said, "but they understand.
20106	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
20107	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
20111	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"OK, I shouldn't have done that.
20115	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He added, "It took for that to happen for me to learn."
20116	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Since April, Manning has joined the Bears' family and created a family of his own.
20119	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.
20120	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In his arms, he was cradling his sleeping son.
20121	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning walked past a makeshift TV studio where Gould was being interviewed about his game-winning field goal.
20124	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Not a single fan stuck to him.
20125	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.
20130	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
20131	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
20133	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
20136	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The campaign says that the foreign policy team, which also includes scholars and experts with different policy approaches, is meant to give Giuliani a variety of perspectives.
20139	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And while Giuliani, like other New York mayors, liked to be seen as conducting his own brand of foreign policy from City Hall, he had little direct exposure to many of the specific issues the next president will confront and is still meeting for the first time with some of his advisers to develop detailed positions on particular subjects.
20141	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Warnings like that one and his reliance on advisers like Podhoretz, who wrote an article in June for Commentary magazine called "The Case for Bombing Iran," have raised concerns among some Democrats.
20146	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
20148	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
20149	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
20159	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani calls for continuing the war in Iraq and building up the military by adding at least 10 new combat brigades to the Army.
20161	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He would continue the Bush administration's efforts to fight AIDS and malaria in Africa, but would tailor policy toward Africa to emphasize trade over aid.
20164	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	On the question of diplomacy, Giuliani makes it clear that he would impose a number of conditions before opening talks with unfriendly countries.
20169	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.
20173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
20176	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."
20179	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"America shouldn't be even-handed in dealing with the difference between an elected democracy that's a government ruled by law, and a group of terrorists," he said.
20183	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The co-founder of Neteller, a company based in Britain that processed billions of dollars in Internet gambling transactions for Americans, has pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal conspiracy.
20184	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Lawrence, whose company, Neteller PLC, was once one of the primary ways U.S. citizens placed bets with offshore bookies, acknowledged in a federal courtroom in Manhattan that the operation was illegal.
20185	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	"I came to understand that providing payment services to online gambling Web sites serving customers in the United States was wrong," he told the judge Friday.
20187	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and another Neteller director, John David Lefebvre, were arrested in January as part of a U.S. crackdown on the online gambling industry.
20189	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Their company was based in the Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
20191	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The company also was not directly involved in either placing or receiving bets.
20192	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It essentially served as a financial middleman, through which bettors could send and receive cash from Web-based operations located in countries with few restrictions on gambling.
20194	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, who remains free on $5 million (euro3.7 million) bail, declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
20196	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He said Lawrence intended to return to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been scheduled for October.
20197	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	It was not immediately clear whether Lawrence will face prison time.
20198	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the case.
20201	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1999, the company grew fast as spooked credit card companies, worried about legal liability, stopped doing business with offshore gambling operations.
20205	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence, at one point, was the company's largest shareholder.
20206	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Both he and Lefebvre have since left the company's board of directors.
20207	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Lawrence and Lefebvre are among a group of businessmen linked to online gambling who have faced U.S. charges.
20208	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Stephen Kaplan, the founder of the London-based bookmaker BetOnSports PLC, was indicted on racketeering charges in St. Louis.
20210	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The chairman of Sportingbet PLC was detained briefly last year in New York after he was indicted on online gambling charges in Louisiana.
20212	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	The crackdown has not sat well abroad.

20232	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The Black Family Channel will shut down and has sold its space on cable systems to the Gospel Music Channel, the networks said Tuesday.
20233	APW_ENG_20070501.1427.LDC2009T13	The deal makes the Gospel Music Channel available in America's 10 largest markets, and it expects to finish the year with more than 20 million subscribers, the network said.
20238	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The top U.S. representative of the Tamil Tigers, a rebel group designated as a foreign terrorist organization, orchestrated a covert campaign to finance its escalating conflict with military forces in Sri Lanka, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
20239	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Karunakaran Kandasamy, 50, was ordered held without bail in Brooklyn on charges of providing material support to terrorists.
20241	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	In the past several years, the Tamil Tigers group has "covertly operated within the United States, drawing on America's financial resources and technological advances to further its war of terror in Sri Lanka and elsewhere," U.S. Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf said in a statement.
20244	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	The arrest was the latest attempt by U.S. authorities to cut off support for the group which, according to court papers, has engaged "in terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings and political assassinations," while fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic minority Tamils in the island nation's north and east.
20245	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Last year, its emissaries were charged in Brooklyn with conspiring to buy surface-to-air missiles.
20246	APW_ENG_20070425.1809.LDC2009T13	Prosecutors also alleged the defendants tried to bribe U.S. officials to remove the group from the terrorism list.

20291	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
20294	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
20298	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.
20301	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.

20304	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	But at the same time, Bush's top diplomat made clear that diplomacy involving Syria and Iran remained out of the question.
20305	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over neighboring Lebanon.

20337	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
20341	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.

20355	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	PLC. reported narrowing second-quarter losses Thursday as sales surged for its multiple sclerosis-fighting drug, Tysabri.
20360	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	About 32,000 sufferers of MS, an incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system causing sudden partial paralysis, are already taking Tysabri, nearly triple the level of 12 months ago.
20364	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
20365	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.
20366	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The three PML victims were simultaneously taking another MS-fighting drug
20368	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The further we go (without any new PML cases), the more comfortable that people become and the more that patients demand to be put on Tysabri," Cooke said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
20369	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
20371	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.

20390	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
20392	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
20394	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People briefed on the matter said Bloomberg, 66, would seek to change the law through legislation in the council.
20396	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But the measure would require voter approval for the change to become permanent, these people said.
20399	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	City voters passed term limits by overwhelming margins in 1993, and reaffirmed their support in 1996.
20400	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
20401	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"Democracy," he added, "is bigger than any one person."
20402	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year.
20403	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members, business leaders and newspaper editorial boards, all of whom Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes.
20405	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The New York Post and the New York Daily News have already endorsed Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
20406	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
20407	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Bloomberg, a billionaire, spent more than $70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote.
20412	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	With his decision, Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall -- deputy mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey -- who have expressed opposition to a third term.
20413	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Those aides have told the mayor -- at times forcefully -- that any campaign to challenge the term-limits law would look like an end run around voters, and could sully his legacy as a reform- minded outsider.
20415	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
20416	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
20417	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
20421	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"This is a good time for him to do this.
20422	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	People are scared."
20423	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Even Ronald R. Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir who waged the successful 1993 campaign to create term limits in the city, has signed onto a Bloomberg third term, citing the tumultuous economy.
20424	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I saw what was happening with the economy and with prospects for the city," Lauder said in an interview on Tuesday.
20429	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
20433	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	But if the mayor succeeds in revising the law, all of those candidates can seek a third term in their current offices.
20436	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
20437	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
20438	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"While Mike Bloomberg will undoubtedly have some opposition -- there will be somebody -- I expect him to be overwhelming re-elected."
20440	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

20564	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The differences between No. 1 UCLA and No. 12 Western Kentucky were far greater than their seedings.
20565	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Each program entered the West Region semifinals of the NCAA tournament with starkly different styles.
20567	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
20568	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.
20569	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA survived scary second- half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with an 88-78 victory.
20570	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA (34-3) is on the cusp of becoming the third team to reach a Final Four in three consecutive years since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.
20572	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
20573	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	For Western Kentucky (29-7), the lopsided loss ends a dazzling season that saw the Hilltoppers storm through the Sun Belt tournament and into America's consciousness when Ty Rogers' 3-point heave topped Drake in overtime in the first round.
20574	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA led by 21 points at halftime, exploiting its size advantage.
20575	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-8 sophomore forward James Keefe finished with 18 points.
20576	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Keefe's career high coming into the game was eight.
20578	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But UCLA struggled mightily in the second half against the Hilltoppers' full-court pressure, which allowed Western Kentucky to creep within four points and perpetuate UCLA's reputation as a team that can always make a game close.
20579	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	That's something that could haunt the Bruins as they advance.
20583	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA held Western Kentucky to 18.8 percent shooting in the first half and 34.7 for the game.

20586	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the Hilltoppers trailed early and could not play catch-up, leaving the Bruins a bit of time to breathe in the second half in anticipation of their game against Xavier.
20589	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	And those are only the ones from outside the Atlantic 10.
20591	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA entered the game against Western Kentucky ranked No. 5 nationally in scoring defense.
20593	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The biggest concern that UCLA will have heading into the game is the erratic play of Collison, the point guard.
20598	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.

20639	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
20640	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, CSRC said individuals would be barred from taking physical delivery of gold in futures trading and could buy bullion only from banks or the spot market.

20686	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.

20756	NYT_ENG_20080130.0118.LDC2009T13	"I don't think either one has shown that determination to score," Vanbiesbrouck said.

20840	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"I'm just waiting and watching for any sign that the interest rates will drop."
20846	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
20847	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	As part of the stimulus package, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be allowed to buy or guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 for single-family homes.
20848	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
20850	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The stimulus package also increases the limits for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
20851	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
20853	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are about the only ones investors are buying these days, which is why policymakers wanted jumbos added to the mix.
20858	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
20859	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
20861	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	it's expected to tell lenders next month what the limits are in various areas.
20862	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
20863	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
20866	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the Stanford Group Company, a policy research firm in Washington, estimated that if the cap is based on median prices compiled by the National Association of Realtors, locally it would be about $500,000 and would apply to an area that extends into West Virginia.
20868	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
20869	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lower rates would help Galloway, the Charles County homeowner.
20870	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
20872	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
20873	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
20874	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
20875	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
20876	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
20878	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Because when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy these loans from lenders, they sell them to investors on the secondary market.
20882	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
20883	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
20886	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
20888	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

21492	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
21493	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
21494	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His animosity toward Microsoft has long been publicly understated and analytic in quality.
21499	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Whatever the outcome of Microsoft bid, analysts say, the move and Google's countermoves represent an escalation in the confrontation between the two companies.
21500	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google says the Microsoft bid raises grave competitive and policy issues.
21503	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In Washington, Google lobbyists urged regulators to scrutinize any Microsoft-Yahoo merger.
21506	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"But for Eric, it's as if something from your past has kicked in, and the feared enemy from the north is at your door."
21509	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	His resentment of Microsoft, it seems, stems in part from his view that it is a triumph of market muscle over superior technology -- a common belief in Silicon Valley.
21510	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Now, after a long career there, Schmidt finds himself leading a company that has plenty of market muscle of its own, and it is Microsoft for once that is struggling to compete.
21513	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, they say, has warned that Microsoft could then combine its dominance in PC software to steer users to online software and services, and lock them into Microsoft technology -- in a way "exactly analogous" to the company's tactics in the '90s.
21514	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft's corporate behavior led to antitrust challenges and sanctions in the United States and Europe.
21515	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Microsoft argues that its purchase of Yahoo would give Google a solid competitor in the Internet search and ad markets, enhancing consumer benefits and hastening innovation.
21516	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The Google campaign against Microsoft's bid, to some degree, underlines the broadening competition between the two technology giants.
21519	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But Google has begun offering Web-based word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software as an alternative to Microsoft's lucrative desktop programs.
21520	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google's online programs are free, or $50 a user for companies that want technical support.
21522	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"And that's why Microsoft is so eager to have a response.
21523	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	It's buying Yahoo to become a much more vigorous competitor in search and advertising, Google's core business."
21525	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	And its protests of the deal, some analysts suggest, amount to posturing with intent.
21529	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Google complained that the search box steered users to Microsoft's browser as the default, and expressed its concerns to state antitrust regulators, the Justice Department and the European Commission.
21531	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In June 2006, the Justice Department concluded that the design of Microsoft's browser was not anti-competitive.
21532	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Since then, Google's share of Internet searches has continued to climb.
21533	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	For its part, Google has plenty that is proprietary.
21534	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Its search algorithms and the design, even the size, of its data centers are trade secrets.
21536	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	In an interview in November, Schmidt said he understood the comparison but that it "rankled" him.
21539	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	"Fundamentally, they blocked people from entering their ecosystem."
21542	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	But the one that we decided that was most important was not to trap user data.
21546	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Regulators in the United States and Europe can be expected to look closely at Microsoft's propose acquisition of Yahoo and decide whether Google is being paranoid or not.

21631	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The data breach is believed to be the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which said the suspects were charged with conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft.
21633	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The indictment returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Boston alleges that the suspects hacked into the wireless computer networks of retailers including TJX Cos., BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes &amp

21798	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And there was Jackie Earle Haley, a man whose more recent credits include titles such as ``Maniac Cop 3,'' who wept when the honor sank in.
21799	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Man, this is just a crazy, crazy, crazy day,'' said Haley, nominated for his creepy turn as Ronnie the pedophile in ``Little Children.''
21801	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Then at 7:30 in the morning my wife came running into the room ... screaming, 'You got it!
21802	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	You got it!'
21804	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	It was such an overwhelming torrent of emotion, it was unbelievable.''
21807	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	(And let's be candid: The eight nominations include three in the same category, Original Song).
21815	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	There was also some serious Americana -- in the form of ``Little Miss Sunshine,'' which took four major nominations (including Best Picture) for an indie film about a dysfunctional family en route to one of those truly red-white-and-blue events: a little girls' beauty pageant.
21816	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Extra-thick double-fudge icing'' is how producer Peter Saraf referred to the film's Oscar success, which included nods for original screenplay and supporting actors Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.
21826	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``Apocalypto,'' Mel Gibson's violent Mayan film, was nominated for Best Makeup, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing -- three categories that, for better or worse, mean Gibson does not go to the microphone.
21829	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Eastwood is a 10-time nominee (this year both for producing and directing ``Iwo Jima'') and a four-time winner (Best Picture and director, for both ``Million Dollar Baby'' and ``Unforgiven'').
21830	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And Winslet, at 31, earned her fifth nomination (Best Actress for ``Little Children.'')
21831	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	Joining Winslet in that category are Penelope Cruz for Pedro Almodovar's ``Volver,'' Judi Dench for ``Notes on a Scandal,'' Streep and Mirren.
21832	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	In the Best Actor category, Whitaker is up against Leonardo DiCaprio -- who was nominated for ``Blood Diamond'' but was just as often mentioned for his role in ``The Departed'' -- Peter O'Toole (``Venus''), Ryan Gosling (``Half Nelson'') and Smith.
21833	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I don't think anyone is more shocked than me,'' Gosling said Tuesday, noting that ``Half Nelson'' was a smaller film ``we didn't even expect to get distribution.''
21836	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``It was a brilliant script and a brilliant character, and the minute I read the script I knew I wanted to do it.''
21840	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``I talked with Al this morning,'' said Davis Guggenheim, the film's director.
21841	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``He was really happy.
21842	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	I asked him, 'So you're ready to go to the show?'
21843	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	And he said, 'I'll think about it.' ''
21845	LTW_ENG_20070124.0139.LDC2009T13	``The thought of him going down the red carpet is really exciting,'' he said. ''

21865	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	But on his next pass, JaMarcus Russell threw deep to the right toward tight end Zach Miller.
21867	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	The 6-foot-3, 223-pounder from Boca Raton dashed up the left sideline, weaved across the field, shaking off a few tackles, followed a crushing block by Tanard Jackson and was finally dragged down by Russell at the Oakland 11 for an 84-yard return.
21868	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was Piscitelli's second career interception (both this season), and it set up Cadillac Williams' 8-yard touchdown run that put the Bucs up 24-14 with 11:27 left.

21898	NYT_ENG_20081228.0180.LDC2009T13	It was good to help make a big play and to help us try to win this game.
