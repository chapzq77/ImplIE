30	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Senior European Union representatives were to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Monday to prepare the ground for an EU-U.S. summit on April 30 in Washington.
33	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Following the meeting with Rice, the three European representatives were to participate in a corporate forum on energy technology research to be chaired by Rice and Steinmeier.
34	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	Ahead of Steinmeier's departure from Germany on Sunday, the German foreign minister suggested that the U.S. plan to build a missile defense system in Europe-- an issue that has been a point of contention -- has merits.
35	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	But in an opinion piece for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung printed Sunday, Steinmeier said an open dialogue was needed to address concerns from all sides.
38	APW_ENG_20070319.0041.LDC2009T13	While the U.S. has tried to allay those concerns with assurances that the deterrent was intended to counteract Iran's developing missile program and the small number of installations would have little effect on Russia's thousands of missiles, Moscow has remained unconvinced and has suggested the deployment could lead to a new arms race or rekindling of the Cold War.

60	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The estimated 4,000 fans attending seemed unconcerned about complaints that the concert and others like it exploit or misuse the 1,200-year-old Mayan ruins.
61	APW_ENG_20081005.0146.LDC2009T13	The concert's name is a reference to a temple platform at Chichen Itza crowned by rows of columns.

88	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The chemical was mixed into watered-down milk to make it appear richer in protein, but it caused severe kidney and urinary tract problems in babies who drank contaminated milk powder.
89	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The Gengs are accused of being "middlemen" who added melamine into milk, which was then sold to Sanlu, the largest Chinese dairy producer to have become embroiled in the scandal.
91	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	On Monday, nine people suspected of trading or producing the tainted additives went on trial in Shijiazhuang and surrounding districts, while five others were tried on Friday last week.
94	AFP_ENG_20081230.0533.LDC2009T13	The scandal, which emerged in September after initially being covered up, shook the foundations of a Chinese food industry that was already beset by repeated safety problems.

106	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The government's sweeping list of promises to make wounded Iraq war veterans whole, at least financially, has not reached this small house in the hills of rural West Virginia, where one vehicle has already been repossessed and the answering machine screens for bill collectors.
107	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
108	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After revelations about the poor treatment of outpatient soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center earlier this year, President Bush appointed a commission to study the care of the nation's war-wounded.
112	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
114	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
118	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, there are clothes to wash, meals to cook, kids to get ready for school and a husband who is placidly medicated or randomly explosive.
119	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.
121	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"He can't make decisions.

138	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	he asks one day.
144	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
146	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
152	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy's pill box is between them, along with the silence.
154	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
161	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
167	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
168	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
169	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle was dating Troy at the time.
170	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.
171	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When he asked if she wanted out of the relationship, she said she would stick by him as long as he continued to treat her well.
173	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	For 18 months Troy worked as a truck driver until his symptoms began to worsen.
174	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
177	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA rated Troy's disability level at 50 percent, resulting in $860 a month in compensation.
182	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
185	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
186	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle and Troy move down the hallways, passing a room near the PTSD residence where a group of young vets, some tattooed and still muscled from the desert, are playing a game of ring toss.
196	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The vet shakes his head angrily.
199	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
202	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
207	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	the counselor asks.

236	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners received $4,500 to cover three months of late car payments, rent and various other bills, and a grocery card for food.

241	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
242	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
243	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I am at the end of my rope," Michelle says.
245	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.

278	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA concludes that Troy's worsening condition merits an increase of his disability rating to 70 percent, raising his monthly check to $1,352 a month.
284	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But there is good news: The VA hospital in Martinsburg finds a bed for Troy in the PTSD residential rehab program.
286	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy will get help and she will get a respite.
287	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy packs his small suitcase with resignation.

326	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Well, maybe a little bit because you're wondering what if they keep hitting those shots."
327	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The arena section where American fans were sitting was revved up and hoping for more of Carr.
331	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Carr, a 5-foot-11 junior from the Seattle area, scored a game- high 26 points, making 9 of 21 field goals.
332	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	For most of the game, he made things interesting by throwing in 3-pointers from the wing after exhausting most of the shot clock, as well as the Tennessee defense.
335	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"It's really not a checkout situation," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said.
338	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	JaJuan Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, was playing tough defense on Carr, staying closer than arm's reach, and would not let him get another good look at the rim.

348	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
349	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Tennessee shot 48 percent from the floor and managed to get to the free-throw line more often than American, making 22 of 31 free throws compared with 6 of 12 for the Eagles.

397	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some spots - the fourth floor KidStage, for example - were tucked away, almost impossible to find.
398	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.

522	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	The U.N. mediator Martti Ahtisaari presented his proposals for the final status of Kosovo on Friday, likely setting the tiny war-torn territory on its way toward independence.
523	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Although that goal is still months away and subject to a vote at the United Nations, the presentation of a plan is an important and long-delayed step in resolving the still potentially explosive tensions that led to war in Europe eight years ago.
527	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	Even with the promise of international involvement, the diplomats say, Russia, a Serbian ally whose support is key, remains cool to the plan.
531	NYT_ENG_20070126.0182.LDC2009T13	If the U.N. Security Council approves the plan, Kosovo is expected to quickly declare its independence and could expect swift recognition from its U.S. and European supporters, even if Serbia rejected such a move.

1432	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
1433	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.

1442	APW_ENG_20071009.0547.LDC2009T13	Okruashvili was charged with extortion, money-laundering and abuse of power.

1467	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Former President Clinton has collected a whopping $51.9 million in appearance fees since leaving office in Jan. 2001 -- averaging about $150,000 per speech.
1469	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons -- who left the White House $5 million in debt after running up legal bills during the impeachment battle -- were so strapped they turned to fundraiser Terry McAuliffe to put up the $1.35 million needed to buy their New York mansion in 1999.
1471	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who released his tax returns months ago, has often taunted Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for refusing to release hers earlier, suggesting she wasn't committed to transparency.
1472	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	There are few negative surprises in the Clintons' long-awaited filings, which included full returns from 2000 to 2006 and a one- page summary estimating their 2007 return (They will seek an extension of time to file the 2007 return, as they have in the past three years).
1473	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But evidence of the Clintons' skyrocketing wealth -- including investments in a pair of hedge funds -- isn't likely to help the former first lady in Pennsylvania or West Virginia, where she is counting on the support of financially stressed blue-collar voters.
1474	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Hillary Clinton accounted for about $11 million of the couple's income -- most of it from the $10.5 million she's earned from her 2002 autobiography "Living History."
1478	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	John Kerry is the richest senator with a net worth estimated at $211 million.
1479	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Barack and Michelle Obama are relative paupers, earning about $3.9 million from 2000 to 2007.
1480	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	But they gave less to charity than the Clintons as a percentage of their income over that period, about $147,000 or about 4 percent.
1481	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
1483	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clinton tax returns offer tantalizing glimpses into the couple's financial lives but leave several questions unanswered.
1484	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.
1486	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	"The Clintons made interest-free loans to some of their family members," said Carson.
1489	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The returns shed greater light on Bill Clinton's close relationship with billionaire California businessman Ron Burkle, a family friend who has paid him about $15 million since 2002 as an adviser and rainmaker.

1531	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
1539	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although there are other over-the-counter medicines of questionable effectiveness, no one could point to a specific product or class of products used as widely as the cough and cold medication that were a cause for obvious concern.
1540	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
1542	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
1548	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
1549	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
1555	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"We now understand that we can organize studies in children and don't have to extrapolate from adults.
1559	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The Journal of the American Medical Association published an analysis in 1993 that concluded there was no good evidence the medications worked.
1561	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Although many pediatricians were aware of the mounting doubts and began urging their patients not to use the products, some doctors continued to counsel their patients they could, and the products remained a mainstay.
1564	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
1565	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The American Academy of Pediatrics adopted a policy in 1997 stating cough products were ineffective, and the American College of Chest Physicians produced a similar statement in 2006.
1568	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
1569	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Some experts defend the medical groups, saying policy statements from doctor groups can only do so much, especially against the aggressive marketing by large pharmaceutical companies, which spend more than $50 million a year to sell the products.
1570	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"For the past 25 or 30 years we've been warning about violence on TV," said Snodgrass, who also chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on drugs.
1571	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"What has that done?
1579	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	This was known in the profession," Sharfstein said.
1585	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .

2217	AFP_ENG_20040830.0308.LDC2007T07	Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Monday said US forces fighting militia in Najaf were defeated by the "spiritual glory" of the Iraqi Shiite holy city.

2227	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Vice President Cheney personally orchestrated his office's 2003 efforts to rebut claims that the administration used flawed intelligence to justify the war in Iraq and discredit a critic who he believed was making him look foolish, according to testimony and evidence Thursday in the criminal trial of his former chief of staff.
2229	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Aboard Air Force 2, on a trip back from the launch of a battleship in Norfolk, Va., Cheney instructed his chief of staff, Lewis ``Scooter'' Libby, about responding to a Time magazine reporter who questioned how the faulty intelligence on Iraq had become one of the Bush administration's central arguments for going to war.
2230	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
2235	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby, 56, is charged with lying to investigators and a grand jury about how the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA officer Valerie Plame, was leaked to the media days after Wilson went public with his claims that the administration had twisted his findings to justify the war in Iraq.
2240	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Also Thursday, Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, told the judge he was concerned that Libby's defense team was trying to improperly introduce elements of its ``bad memory'' defense without putting Libby on the stand, by questioning each witness about details no reasonable person could remember.
2242	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin's testimony Thursday also illustrated how doggedly Cheney insisted that the administration had significant evidence that Iraq was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction -- even after the White House had backed off that claim and admitted it was not solid enough for the president to have cited it in his January 2003 State of the Union address.
2243	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney told Martin to alert the media that a highly classified and recent National Intelligence Estimate indicated no doubts about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium.
2247	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
2252	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
2254	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Attorneys for Libby repeatedly pressed Martin to acknowledge that, though she saw Cheney and Libby working overtime to rebut Wilson's criticisms, she had no evidence that either tried to leak Plame's name to the press.
2255	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	``At no time did Vice President Cheney indicate to you that he considered Valerie Wilson part of the story he wanted to get out,'' attorney Theodore Wells said to Martin.

2265	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	The Danish Road Safety Council said meanwhile the initiative was foolish.
2271	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Fundraising professionals say they expect the candidates to greatly exceed totals from previous cycles, perhaps by hundreds of millions of dollars.
2272	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days.
2273	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
2274	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	A confluence of other factors -- including voter dissatisfaction with the Bush administration, wide-open fields in both parties, higher donation caps and a rush by large states such as California and Texas to move their primaries to the front of the nominating process -- has compelled campaigns to establish virtually round-the-clock fundraising schedules, with candidates and surrogates participating in sometimes a dozen events or more in a day.
2279	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
2280	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., has similarly played down his goals, with aides saying they would be thrilled with a take of $7 million to $12 million this quarter.
2281	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
2285	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	For Edwards and other Democrats seeking to catch up with Clinton and Obama -- such as Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson -- the money flow, or lack thereof, could produce a moment of reckoning.
2286	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
2287	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``If a candidate can't raise the money, it bodes poorly for that candidate and might cause them to rethink their candidacy.''
2288	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Alan Solomont, chairman of Obama's fundraising effort in New England, described the campaign's fundraising venture as a ``start-up'' that has required building from the ground up in a short time.
2293	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Nova declined to give the exact figure brought in but described it as a ``significant, multi-hundred-thousand dollar amount'' -- far in excess of the $50,000 he set out to raise.

2585	AFP_ENG_20081015.0264.LDC2009T13	The main problem, Bernanke said, is "a loss of confidence" in markets and financial institutions.

2926	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he understood that was her attorney's desire and it was not unusual for phones to be used in misdemeanor cases.
2927	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Outside the courthouse, people on other business stopped to gawk at news cameras.
2928	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	One of them was Moses Baltazar who was attempting to clear up his own traffic ticket.
2929	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He said he was no fan of Hilton, noting she once tipped him only a dollar when he worked as a valet, even though he helped keep paparazzi away from her.
2930	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	He also said there was no excuse for her flouting the law.

2933	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The frenzy began early Thursday when sheriff's officials released Hilton because of an undisclosed medical condition and sent her to her Hollywood Hills home under house arrest where she was to serve out the remainder of her 45-day sentence.
2934	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	She had spent three days, and was credited for five.
2936	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In jail, she was expected to serve just 23 days.
2937	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The decision by Sheriff Lee Baca to move Hilton chafed prosecutors and Sauer, who spelled out during sentencing that Hilton was not allowed to serve house detention.
2940	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The move also was met with outrage from the sheriff's deputies union, members of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, civil rights leaders, defense attorneys and others.

2945	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice," Baca said.

2950	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	The Los Angeles County jail system is so overcrowded that attorneys and jail officials have said it is not unusual for nonviolent offenders like Hilton to be released after serving as little as 10 percent of their sentences.
2951	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	In the hours after Hilton's release, it was a madcap scene outside her house in the hills above the Sunset Strip.
2954	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	Shortly before noon, Hilton issued a statement through her attorney.
2957	APW_ENG_20070608.1166.LDC2009T13	I have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes."

3299	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The problem is that the federal definition of an emergency is open to interpretation: an acute condition that, without immediate care, would seriously jeopardize a patient's health or impair bodily functions, parts or organs.

3316	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.

3323	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The fear in many states is that offering routine dialysis will lure more sick people from other countries.

3351	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Howard D. Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced sweeping changes on Wednesday for the company as it seeks to reconnect with customers who have left for competitors or pared back their coffee budget in hard economic times.
3353	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In front of 6,000 investors, employees and analysts at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Schultz introduced an improved automated espresso machine that grinds coffee for each drink and has a lower height that will allow customers to see baristas making their beverage.
3355	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz also announced the acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Co., the four-year-old Seattle-based maker of the Clover coffee machine, which brews a more expensive, higher-quality coffee one cup at a time.
3362	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	They are going back to their core," said Sharon Zackfia, a securities analyst with William Blair &amp
3369	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"This is the first time the U.S. business is under pressure.
3371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
3372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
3373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
3376	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	This is about us.
3377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
3379	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company faces a hurdle that may be impossible to overcome in the short term: Will penny-pinching Americans, in the grip of an economic downturn or recession, still pay $4.10 for their daily dose of white chocolate mocha-flavored coffee?
3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
3389	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Today, coffee can sit in Starbucks' urns for as long as two hours.
3390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
3391	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Also on Wednesday, Starbucks introduced a new online community, mystarbucksidea.com, where Schultz and other managers will contribute to a corporate blog.
3393	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The site opens Thursday.
3395	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
3400	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Analysts say new stores cannibalized traffic from existing stores and thinned the ranks of well-trained Starbucks managers and employees.

4714	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There was a time when the Episcopal Church in the United States was known as "the Republican Party at prayer," but in the last 30 years it has evolved into the Rainbow Coalition of Christianity.
4715	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are hip-hop Masses, Native American rituals to install a new presiding bishop and legions of gay and straight priests who don the rainbow stoles of gay liberation.
4717	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	Now the conservatives who numerically dominate the global Anglican Communion have handed their Episcopal branch in the United States an ultimatum that requires the church to reel in the rainbow if it wants to remain a part of the Communion.
4719	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.
4721	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	In interviews on Tuesday, some liberal and moderate leaders who constitute the church's majority voiced everything from confusion to serious misgivings to defiance.

4734	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique recommends that the Episcopal Church establish new positions of authority, a council and a "primatial vicar," who will have oversight of the conservatives within the Episcopal Church, so they do not have to turn to primates from other countries.
4736	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	He said he expected that the House of Bishops would meet in March to take up the communique's recommendations, and that the bishops alone would have the authority to decide whether to accept them.
4742	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	If this is all the communique is requiring, they suggested, the Episcopal Church can live with that.

6021	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
6023	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The bottom line with the Highway Trust Fund is that spending is at a higher level than funds coming in," U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters said in an interview Wednesday.
6026	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the commission began a two-day hearing with California transit officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's downtown Los Angeles office to discuss the region's needs.
6027	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Peters said one estimate shows the highway portion of the Highway Trust Fund -- which pays for roads and bridges and uses 80 percent of the federal gas tax that is collected -- will see a $230 million deficit by fiscal year 2009.
6028	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	That doesn't mean the account will be at zero, but rather that it won't reach levels authorized by Congress.
6029	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
6030	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
6031	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.

6039	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
6040	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
6042	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
6044	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said hybrids account for just a fraction of the car market and could not be playing a significant role in the decline of the Highway Trust Fund.
6047	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
6052	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Beal said there are several alternative revenue options for the fund that are likely to come under greater scrutiny in California.
6053	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
6056	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.
6057	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.

6174	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Joyandet stressed that the moment is right for the country "to consolidate its waning presence" in the African continent.
6175	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"This is not the time to leave Africa" because "the time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa is now," Joyandet was quoted as telling reporters shortly after arriving in Dakar on Friday.

6812	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
6813	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
6814	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But at the beginning of this year, buoyed by President Hugo Chavez's re-election victory, the local government allied with him responded to the many complaints about the area and cleared the vendors out.
6817	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
6820	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	In Sabana Grande, pickpockets flourished under the vendors' plastic tarps, where products like pharmaceuticals of dubious origin, smuggled Colombian lingerie or pirated Hollywood DVDs were available.

6842	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
6843	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Critics of the municipal government say the vendors' removal was opportunistic because it took place only after the president won re-election in December.

7066	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
7068	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	He added that oil prices, which have been driven to record levels partly because of fear about the loss of Iran's 4.0-million- barrel-a-day output, would rise sharply if Israel or the United States launched a military strike.
7069	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	His comments on the sidelines of an oil conference here came as Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking to US media, said that a "new process" was underway in the dispute about the country's nuclear programme.
7070	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The encouragement was greeted with scepticism by Washington but more positively in Brussels where EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana described as "interesting."
7071	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
7072	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
7073	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"A process is underway and it started with the package delivered by Iran," Mottaki said in an interview with US media in New York, according to the state- run IRNA news agency.
7074	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
7076	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
7083	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran insists its atomic drive is entirely peaceful and it needs nuclear energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out.
7084	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The United States and its regional ally Israel have never ruled out military strikes to end what they see as Tehran's defiance.

7288	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The Yankees are about to miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993, the year Derek Jeter made 56 errors at Class A.
7290	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The realist in Girardi knows that the Yankees, who had a major-league-leading $209 million payroll when the season opened, are wading through the end of a dark, disappointing season under his watch.
7291	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I think the way you rationalize it is we didn't do as well as we were supposed to or as well as we thought we were going to, however you want to put it," Girardi said.
7292	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"We expected more.
7294	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	As Girardi sifts through the damage of a year in which the Yankees have spent only two days in first place in the American League East, and none since April, he is more comfortable blaming himself than he is in openly dissecting how and why the team fizzled.
7295	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi would rather say that he takes responsibility for the season, because that is easier than trying to explain why the high-profile offense was feeble, why the rookie pitchers Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy flopped and why second baseman Robinson Cano and outfielder Melky Cabrera regressed.
7296	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	If Girardi blames himself, it is cleaner than recounting the laundry list he undoubtedly has in his head.
7297	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"Your job is to get the most out of your players," he said.

7300	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Jeter, the team's captain, said that Girardi made a smooth transition as Joe Torre's successor and did "a good job."
7301	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Although Girardi pointed 10 fingers at himself, Jeter twisted his fingers in 25 directions.
7302	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"It gets to the point where you have to be accountable for your own play," Jeter said.
7307	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Did Girardi rely too much on statistics in benching left-handed hitting veterans against left-handed pitchers?
7308	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Is he too controlling?
7310	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Can he be the manager who helps resurrect the Yankees?
7314	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Well, you don't know what I'm going through because you've never done it.
7315	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Until you actually sit in that chair, you don't know what it's like."
7317	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi is baseball smart and book smart, but his reticence to be revelatory in many instances can be frustrating.
7319	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Still, on multiple occasions, Girardi provided an account of a player's injury only to have the player contradict him and give a graver appraisal.
7320	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he did not mind if those developments wounded his credibility.
7321	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"I don't necessarily worry so much about how I look," he said.
7323	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	David Cone, who threw 88 pitches to catcher Girardi in fashioning a perfect game with the Yankees in July 1999, is an analyst for the YES Network.
7324	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said Girardi was excellent at maneuvering his relievers, an area in which Torre drew criticism.
7326	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi squeezed contributions out of Kyle Farnsworth and production from Jose Veras, Edwar Ramirez and Brian Bruney.
7327	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	But Cone also noted how Girardi, who managed the Florida Marlins in 2006, needed to improve in other areas.
7328	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone mentioned the daily briefings with the news media.
7329	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"At some point, you have to give some real insight as to what's going on and how you really feel as opposed to coming up with a company line," Cone said.
7332	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	There's a way to do it.
7333	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He's still learning."
7334	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi does interviews about 10 minutes after games, and he has acknowledged that he is despondent after losses.
7335	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Cone said he was surprised at how dejected Girardi appeared after the Yankees' first defeat of the season.
7340	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	I don't think our players want to lose, either.
7341	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	We're having a tough road.
7344	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	His on-base percentage is a sickly .294.
7346	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	When Girardi was asked if he or any coach did that with Cano, he said, "We've done a lot of different things."
7349	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	"You know as well as I do, how many times can you do it?"
7350	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Pettitte said.
7352	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	Girardi said he would make changes next season, but he was not specific.
7353	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	He said he would review personnel and strategy decisions to try to make sure the Yankees did not underachieve again.
7361	NYT_ENG_20080915.0021.LDC2009T13	The season will end in disillusionment and without a trip to the playoffs, something Girardi had not envisioned.

7466	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	More than a quarter of U.S. women are infected with a sexually transmitted virus that sometimes can cause cervical cancer, health researchers say.
7467	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The study, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides the most comprehensive assessment of human papillomavirus prevalence among American women.
7471	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
7473	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	"From the perspective of cancer prevention, this seems like a clear-cut case in favor of the vaccine," he said.
7477	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry has been rebuked by social conservatives, who say his promotion of the vaccine condones pre-marital sex, as well as legislators who say he exceeded his constitutional powers by issuing the executive order.

8027	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	On a sloping patch of withered grass at his Clarke County, Va., farm one recent afternoon, William Cross did what any seasoned farmer touched with the gift will do in search of a spot to dig a well.
8029	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Within seconds, the rods appeared to respond, flung across each other by what Cross described as the hand of an invisible force.
8033	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	In summers past, rural residents sometimes summoned a dowser to seek water when wells dried up or droughts hit.
8036	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``You're going to get me in trouble,'' Bob Leazer, of Leazer Brothers Drilling and Pump Co., based in Remington in Fauquier County, Va., responded when asked if he employs dowsers to locate the wells his company drills in 13 Virginia counties.
8037	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``I've seen a lot of people that used dowsers, and I've seen 'em hit and I've seen 'em miss.

8040	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	some laud it as a gift from God.
8042	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Yet the tradition endures.
8043	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	If you're going to spend a small fortune poking holes in your back yard to find water, the thinking goes, you might as well try poking a spot marked -- often free of charge -- by a water witch.
8044	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	David Shirley, 47, of Stephenson, Va.-based Shirley Well Drilling, is a third-generation dowser.
8048	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	The National Ground Water Association has published a brochure titled ``Before You Hire a Water Witch'' and declares itself ``strongly opposed'' to the practice.
8050	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``If I could hire a dowser to find 200-gallons-a-minute wells, I would fire all my PhD scientists,'' added Jamie Emery of Emery and Garrett Groundwater Inc. in New Hampshire.
8052	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But those methods can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a study in a small subdivision, out of the price range of many homeowners.
8056	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	``You know there's water down there, but you want to hit it within short order, and you don't want to hit haphazardly,'' said Peter Holden, a Purcellville, Va., farmer who is a liaison to the Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.
8060	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	Lore has it that the term ``water witch'' derives not from a description of a person but rather from the witch hazel branches preferred by Anglo-Scottish immigrants.

8075	LTW_ENG_20070728.0017.LDC2009T13	But until Cross finds $2,000 to get a driller and permits, the presence of water at this spot would remain, rather like his knack with rods, an enigma.

8843	AFP_ENG_20070711.0719.LDC2009T13	"It looks like they are going to let the weather dictate scoring this year rather than how it was in 1999," said US-based English star Luke Donald, who missed the cut that year in what was his major tournament debut.

8853	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Since the original Jeep CJ (civilian jeep) arrived a few decades ago to facilitate motorized access to some of the nation's most remote and beautiful settings, these legendary off-road vehicles have been the favorites of modern-day explorers.
8857	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For the first time, the Wrangler is available with power windows and door locks, even when equipped with the traditional removable doors.
8867	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The Wrangler never has been truly practical for most people to drive as their everyday vehicle, particularly those with a family.
8869	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	None of that really changed with the makeover, although the back seat is a little more comfortable than before.
8872	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The cargo space behind the rear seat is now 17.1 cubic feet, but that expands significantly with the rear seatback folded forward if you don't need the back seat for passengers.
8877	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	The newest Wrangler has more ground clearance, larger wheels and tires, improved Dana solid axles and new optional four-wheel-drive systems.
8879	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three trim levels are available: the X, the midlevel Sahara and the Rubicon.
8880	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	There are hundreds of different top, door and windshield combinations, Jeep said.
8881	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	For this report, we tested the two-door Rubicon version (base price $28,190 plus $700 freight).
8884	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	We didn't have the power door locks, either.
8887	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Jeep says the new Wrangler's frame is 100 percent stiffer than before, and the vehicle is 20 percent quieter.
8899	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	Three skid plates are included on four-wheel-drive models to protect the fuel tank, transfer case and automatic transmission oil pan from rocks and logs.
8900	NYT_ENG_20081006.0051.LDC2009T13	X and Sahara four-wheel-drive models come with Jeep's second- generation Command-Trac part-time, two-speed transfer case.

9260	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
9263	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The study of humor is fairly widespread, with international humor journals and academic humor societies.
9264	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.

9295	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target the victim.

9306	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
9309	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."
9310	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make people aware of how important humor is in communication.

9447	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey was the seventh prisoner executed this year in America's most active death penalty state and the first of two inmates scheduled to die this week.
9448	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Two more are to die next week.
9450	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Prison records showed that since Dorsey arrived on death row eight years ago, he's had at least 95 disciplinary cases, including a 2004 attack where he used an home-made knife to stab an officer 14 times in the back.
9453	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	His threats of violence kept prison officials from making him available for media interviews as his execution date approached and his frequent disciplinary issues kept him in a prison system classification reserved for the most troublesome inmates.
9455	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's mean," Toby Shook, a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Dorsey for capital murder, said, calling him a "true psychopath."
9456	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey already was in prison, serving 60 years after pleading guilty to killing a woman during a convenience store robbery, when a Dallas police cold case squad gathered enough evidence to tie him to the unsolved shooting deaths four years earlier of James Armstrong, 26, and Brad Lindsey, 20, at a Blockbuster Video store in East Dallas where they worked.
9457	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Evidence showed Dorsey, who called himself "Pistol Pete," cased the place on Easter Sunday night in 1994, then returned after midnight to steal $392 from a cash register.
9460	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	When the case was reopened in 1998, Dallas authorities had the tape analyzed by the FBI and determined Dorsey could have been the gunman.
9461	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Five months after the video store killings, Dorsey killed a 51 -year-old Korean woman, Hyon Suk Chon, at the convenience store she managed in Ennis, south of Dallas.
9463	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	Dorsey also admitted the murders to a reporter in an interview from prison while he was awaiting trial.
9466	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	I've killed folks," he told The Dallas Morning News.
9467	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"But it don't bother me."
9471	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He'd walk down the street with a sawed-off shotgun tied to his arm and with a coat on and then just throw it open -- just to see the reaction of people," Shook said.
9472	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	"He's a piece of work."
9473	APW_ENG_20080813.0051.LDC2009T13	On Thursday, Michael Rodriguez, one of the infamous "Texas 7" prison escapees, has volunteered for execution for his part in the fatal shooting of a Dallas-area police officer, Aubrey Hawkins, during a robbery while he and the six other escapees were fugitives in December 2000.

9548	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	As recently as 2001, U.S. imports from the Middle East surpassed African supplies by more than 10 percent, or 1.3 million barrels a day.

9555	APW_ENG_20070221.1461.LDC2009T13	The volume of U.S. crude imports from the Middle East, at 2.22 million barrels a day, dipped just 20,000 barrels a day on the year, but marks the third straight annual decline.

9755	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Under the new Vermont law, there are still few restrictions on using ground water, but the new system is designed to help map it, measure it and apportion it.
9756	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	It puts home and farm uses of water in front of the line in case of shortage, and making large- scale withdrawals, like those contemplated by Antonovich, subject to new permitting and monitoring.

9776	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	The relative cordiality between Antonovich and his neighbors also typified the debate over the public-trust law.
9780	NYT_ENG_20080820.0167.LDC2009T13	Buchsbaum said he believes that the Vermont law, like the Great Lakes compact, can produce fairer and more comprehensive results when done in advance of a crisis, or "we'll be trying to change our water laws in the context that the West is now," he said.

11240	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush was to sign legislation on Wednesday to enact a landmark US-India nuclear deal, in a lavish ceremony to highlight how the pact helps usher in a new era in relations.
11242	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the deal in July 2005, touching off a difficult battle with wary lawmakers on either side and critics who warn it undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear know-how.
11243	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The agreement offers India access to sophisticated US technology and cheap atomic energy in return for allowing UN inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities -- but not military nuclear sites.
11244	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Washington imposed a ban on US-Indian civilian nuclear trade after India's first nuclear test in 1974, but US officials have said a new approach is needed to help the world's largest democracy meet its booming energy needs at a time of skyrocketing oil prices and global warming fears.
11245	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of India’s emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an independent course from Washington.
11246	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The ceremony on Wednesday will draw Vice President Dick Cheney, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, and India's ambassador to Washington, Ronen Sen, to the White House's ornate East Room.
11249	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership," Carroll said in a statement.

11251	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Rice and others had to lobby hard to win approval for the deal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls global atomic trade.
11252	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	She also pushed hard for the agreement to be approved by both Houses of Congress.
11254	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).

11277	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Car sales were remarkably slow in January, probably in part because of dramatic stock market fluctuations that flustered consumers at a time when the housing market and other economic uncertainties were also making headlines," said Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry analysis at the auto information site Edmunds.com.
11280	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	But analysts say this year is notable because the landscape isn't expected to improve until the second half of 2008 at the earliest, when automakers introduce new products and the election brings political uncertainty to an end.
11281	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, buyers are skittish.
11282	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Earlier this week, the Conference Board, a consumer research group, said its latest survey showed consumers were more pessimistic about the economy in January than they had been in December.
11285	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"Our sense is macroeconomic pressures, particularly deteriorating consumer confidence and gas 'permanently' above $3 a gallon, will increasingly catch up with consumers throughout 2008, weighing on demand for durable goods," Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said in a recent note to investors.
11286	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."
11287	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said that while consumers can take comfort in the fact that gas prices seem to be stabilizing, they are still scared off by the weak labor market.
11288	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Barry predicts annual sales of 15 million vehicles in 2008, which would be the lowest U.S. sales rate since 1993.
11289	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Other analysts forecast higher sales, but most automakers and analysts have said sales will likely fall below 16 million.
11290	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Automakers sold 16.3 million vehicles in 2007.
11291	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC could take the biggest blows as they make promised reductions in low-profit sales to rental-car fleets.

11294	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	The environment could make it harder for automakers to hold the line on incentive spending.
11296	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	Still, December spending was 7 percent higher than November, which was 4 percent higher than October, indicating that automakers are trying to shore up the market with incentives.

11390	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is planning to allow cargo packed by approved shippers to be loaded onto passenger airplanes without any further inspection for bombs, despite a new law requiring freight shipments to receive the same level of scrutiny as checked suitcases.
11394	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But in late July, Democrats passed the measure.
11395	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The new law was celebrated as a victory by pilot and flight attendant unions, as well as its main congressional champion, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Malden.
11398	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	TSA spokesman Christopher White said freight "is inherently screened" if it is packed with tamper-evident seals at a facility that meets federal security standards.
11399	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Airline unions and air-safety advocates said they expected that under the new law freight would be either X-rayed or inspected by hand, just like bags checked by passengers.
11403	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"The ((checked)) bags that go to the airport have inspection machines up on the deck where they run it through.
11405	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey, for his part, said he is reserving judgment until the TSA's procedures are finalized.
11408	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Markey has crusaded since 2003 to require the inspection of all cargo that is placed alongside luggage in passenger planes.

11413	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	But Markey has pointed to neutron-pulsing scanning machines that have been tested at several airports.
11416	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	Immediately after Democrats won control of Congress in the November 2006 election, airline industry lobbyists expressed fear that Markey would get his bill passed.
11427	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	The Air Transport Association, a lobbying group for the airline industry, declined to comment on the new screening law.
11429	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	At the time, May praised the law though he had previously spent years saying Markey's proposal would bring disaster.
11434	NYT_ENG_20070824.0098.LDC2009T13	"There will be very vigorous congressional oversight that ensures that the Bush administration has complied with the requirement that all of the cargo placed on passenger planes is actually screened for bombs," Markey said.

12539	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Under a final ruling handed down on Tuesday by the Intermediate People's Court of Baicheng City, Jilin Province, Zhang Xiaoguang was found guilty of taking bribes, corruption, embezzlement of public funds, illegally seeking private interest on behalf of relatives, and possessing major assets for which he could not account, the Beijing News reported.
12542	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	According to the newspaper, Zhang's case is believed to be connected with another incident in which Gao Shan, former head of a branch of the Bank of China (BOC) on Hesong Street in Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, allegedly siphoned 1 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars) from customers' accounts to Canada.
12546	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Zhang was first arrested on Jan. 13, 2005, on charges of misappropriating public funds.

Ltd, a subsidiary of Northeast Expressway, who reportedly gave Zhang 10 million yuan in bribes.
12551	XIN_ENG_20071205.0499.LDC2009T13	Public prosecutors claimed in their indictment that Zhang deposited funds from his company at the BOC Hesong Street Branch after having accepted bribes from Li Dongzhe, the mastermind behind the BOC case, which eventually led to the loss of Northeast Expressway Co. Ltd.'s money.

14147	APW_ENG_20080118.0028.LDC2009T13	But part of the local opposition to the base stems from a wider perception in Poland that the country has been left empty-handed for its staunch support for the U.S. in recent years.

14166	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's a much more expensive revival than most."
14168	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Ghosts," which premiered in 1991, had been scheduled to open in March 2010.
14169	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Cutting it will save more than $1 million.
14170	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"If you look around at all the opera houses and what's happening, it's obvious that this is a time of crisis.
14173	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	In this country, at least, it's certainly boning down."
14174	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb had been a big proponent of increasing the Met's presentations of works by living composers.
14175	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"We will plan to put it in on at another time," he said.
14176	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Chenoweth was understanding.
14177	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	"Kristin is, of course, disappointed, as she was very excited to work with John Corigliano," spokeswoman Jill Fritzo said.
14179	APW_ENG_20081114.0274.LDC2009T13	Gelb hopes to find another opera for the Tony Award-winning Chenoweth, an opera-trained soprano, but nothing has been finalized.

14232	NYT_ENG_20070527.0200.LDC2009T13	I threw my fastball wherever I wanted to, for the most part, and that's key for me."

14907	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	But an EU diplomat said in Brussels that the European Union is in no rush for a response from Iran.

14915	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
14917	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
14919	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But it was reinforced by Sept. 11, 2001, and in the years since, I've only become more convinced that it is critical to Islam's future.
14922	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time to accept that God loves the faithful of all religions.
14923	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for Muslims to question our leaders and their strict teachings, to reach our own understanding of the prophet's words and to call for a bold renewal of our faith as a faith of goodwill, of peace and of light.
14924	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
14925	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once, I was one of the extremists who clung to literal interpretations of Islam and tried to force them on others.
14926	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
14928	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	When I was 16, I found myself assailed by doubts about the existence of God.
14930	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I made a deal with Him: I would give up everything, devote myself to Him and live the way the prophet Muhammad and his companions had lived 1,400 years ago if He would rid me of my doubts.
14931	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
14936	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
14938	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Had it really been revealed to Muhammad, or did he create it himself?
14939	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But I never shared these doubts with anyone, because doubting Islam or the prophet is not tolerated in the Muslim society of my country.
14941	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
14944	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I heard devout Muslims who never missed the five daily prayers lying with ease to people who did not share their extremist beliefs.
14946	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	One, written by a Palestinian scholar, was about the struggle between those who deal pragmatically with the Koran and those who take it and the hadith literally.
14947	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The other was a book by a Moroccan philosopher about the formation of the Arab Muslim way of thinking.
14949	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	We owe it to ourselves, I wrote, to think pragmatically if our religion is to survive and thrive.
14952	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
14955	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
14956	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	After I wrote articles stressing our right as Muslims to question our Saudi clerics and their interpretations and to come up with our own, officials from the kingdom's powerful religious establishment complained, and I was banned from writing.
14959	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I criticized al-Qaida's school of thought, which considers everyone who isn't a Salafi Muslim the enemy.
14960	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
14963	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
14968	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
14969	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
14971	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I continued to pray, but I started to avoid the verses that contain violence or enmity and only used the ones that speak of God's mercy and grace and greatness.
14974	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
14975	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In December 2002, in a Web site interview, I criticized al-Qaida and declared that some of the Friday sermons were loathsome because of their attacks against non-Muslims.
14977	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Once again, I felt despair at the ways of the Muslim world.
14982	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	God is light, it says, the universe is illuminated by His light.
14983	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt the verse was speaking directly to me, sending me a message.
14984	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This God of light, I thought, how could He be against any human?
14989	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	In the late 14th century, Islam had its own sort of Martin Luther.
14991	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Unlike Luther, however, Ibn Taymiyya never openly declared this revolutionary belief
14993	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless, I find myself inspired by Luther's courageous uprising.
14994	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I see what Islam needs -- a strong, charismatic personality who will lead us toward reform, and scholars who can convince Islamic communities of the need for a bold new interpretation of Islamic texts, to reconcile us with the wider world.

15010	APW_ENG_20070614.0263.LDC2009T13	The price has stayed above US$66 a barrel, "a strong level -- and the strong pricing is supported by the tight U.S. gasoline supply situation," Shum said.

15107	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Fishermen concerned about the 58,000-gallon (219,550-liter) spill had requested the fishing suspension, which delays Thursday's scheduled start of the highly anticipated commercial season for Dungeness crab and interrupts the catch for sportfishermen.
15108	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"It's not only heartbreaking but it is also outrageous," said Schwarzenegger, speaking in Oakland at the California State Association of Counties annual meeting.
15110	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
15113	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
15114	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
15117	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
15120	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Governor's spokesman Jeff Macedo said the state Department of Fish and Game will determine which fishing areas will be affected by the order.
15122	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
15123	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The state Department of Fish and Game, working with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response, will determine which areas will be closed to fishing.
15126	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	It is an ecological nightmare for the water, environmentalists say, and one group asked Congress to ban its use.
15128	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
15130	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Federal prosecutors investigating the incident are focusing on problems involving management and communication between the officers on the ship's bridge at the time.
15131	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Among other things, the ship was under new ownership and management, and the crew's experience on the vessel appears to have been limited, officials said.
15136	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	Afghanistan's Islamist Taliban movement said Wednesday it had captured two French humanitarian workers who have been reported missing with three Afghans for nearly two days.
15137	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	The group, travelling in southern Afghanistan, had been out of contact with their organisation, Terre d'Enfance (A World for Our Children), since early Tuesday, the French foreign ministry and Afghan government said earlier.

15146	AFP_ENG_20070404.0514.LDC2009T13	Some critics of the deal that freed Mastrogiacomo said his exchange for Taliban would encourage copycat kidnappings by militants as well as criminals.

15151	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Almost 18 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a top rights group said Friday that the official Chinese government line on the crackdown was overshadowing next year's Beijing Olympic Games.
15152	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"China's total failure to account for the massacre of June 4, 1989 casts a pall on its efforts to project a new image and continues to spawn more abuses," New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
15153	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	The group accused Beijing of harassing survivors, their families and those who challenged what it called the official "whitewash" of events and said the Chinese government had failed to bring justice to the victims of the massacre.
15156	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"Beijing -- and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games -- will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," she said.
15162	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	"But the image the world should not forget is that of a courageous individual facing down a column of tanks, as his fate and that of thousands of other protestors remain unresolved."
15163	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	Beijing has repeatedly dismissed suggestions that hundreds of people were killed in the crackdown, insisting that its handling of the protest was necessary to ensure China's economic growth and stability.

15169	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	YANGON, Sept. 3 (Xinhua)
15172	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The next task of the Myanmar military government is to set up a special commission to draw up a new state constitution based on all the detailed basic principles adopted throughout the convention, which will be followed by a national referendum and a general election to produce parliament representatives and formation of a new democratic government in line with the government's seven-step roadmap.
15173	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
15174	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The country will adopt an executive system of President as head of state and empower a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union Parliament) which comprises Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) in legislation.
15176	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
15177	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
15178	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Besides, armed forces members are also to be nominated by the commander-in-chief to hold posts for four government ministries of defense, security, home affairs and border affairs.
15180	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Dealing with the country's future foreign policy, the principled new state constitution also states that Myanmar will practice an independent, active and non-aligned one and maintain friendly relations with nations and upholding the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.
15182	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
15183	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
15184	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The government started convening the constitutional national convention in January 1993 but there emerged serious differences on some constitution-drafting principles between the military and the NLD, prompting the party to have walked out of the convention in November 1995.
15187	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
15188	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	However, citing the reason of military government's house arrest placed on the party's general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and its vice-chairman U Tin Oo, the NLD kept boycotting the convention until its end.

15558	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
15563	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as the economy has moved from manufacturing toward services, professionals do not necessarily manage anymore, and even low- level workers often need technical expertise, making the categories murkier.

15798	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
15799	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.
15800	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Last month, al-Sadr pulled his six ministers out of the Cabinet in protest of al-Maliki's refusal to demand a timetable for a U.S. pullout, but he did not withdraw his 30 legislators from the governing Shiite bloc.
15801	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr also has taken steps in recent months to restore his national image.

15828	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
15829	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The Department of Transportation has proposed congestion pricing at the nation's busiest airports.
15830	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	After a year of horrible travel delays and cancellations, something had to be done to try to bring order to crowded airports.
15831	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The plan would allow congested airports to charge airlines a fee to take off or land at peak travel times.
15834	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
15836	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
15838	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
15842	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.

15864	APW_ENG_20070804.0545.LDC2009T13	But another soldier convicted in the attack, Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, testified that Spielman stood guard as his fellow soldiers raped the girl.

16227	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The eurozone economy is now on the brink of recession as the financial crisis is devastating the 15-nation bloc sharing the euro currency.

16230	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In technical terms, recession means negative growth in two consecutive quarters.

16243	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	With the threat of the financial crisis on one side, the eurozone economy also faced inflation which remained stubbornly high at 3.6 percent.

16548	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We have already taken urgent and extraordinary steps to stabilize our financial sectors and strengthen economic growth and promote investment and consumption," the statement said.
16549	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	"We will continue to take such steps and work closely, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner, to implement future actions to address this crisis," it added.
16551	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	They also welcomed continued development and innovation in the financial sector, while calling for more effective regulatory and supervisory tools as financial systems become more complex.

16555	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	During the meeting, the leaders highlighted the urgency to curb any upturn of protectionism that could arise from the crisis and exacerbate the current economic situation.

16561	XIN_ENG_20081124.0171.LDC2009T13	The strong call by the leaders for free trade and rejection of protectionism indicates that world economies are determined to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s when "a wrong approach" was taken, as U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said.

16666	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Senior congressional aides said Wednesday that the White House has proposed limiting the much-anticipated appearance on Capitol Hill next month of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker to a private congressional briefing, suggesting instead that the Bush administration's progress report on the Iraq war should be delivered to Congress by the secretaries of state and defense.
16679	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``That's all the more reason why they would need to testify,'' a senior Foreign Relations Committee aide said of Petraeus and Crocker.
16680	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``We would want them to say whether they stand by all the information in the report.''
16681	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
16682	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
16683	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	It also clearly states that the president ``will prepare the report and submit the report to Congress'' after consultation with the secretaries of state and defense and with the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and the U.S. ambassador.
16685	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Bush has repeatedly referred to the general as the one who will be delivering the report in September and has implored the public and Republicans in Congress to withhold judgment until then.
16686	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	In an interim assessment last month, the White House said that significant progress has been shown in fewer than half of the 18 political and security benchmarks outlined in the legislation.
16687	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Several Republicans have hinted that their support will depend on a credible presentation by Petraeus, not only of tangible military progress but of evidence that the Iraqi government is taking real steps toward ethnic and religious reconciliation.
16690	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Baghdad appeared puzzled Wednesday when told that the White House had indicated that the two may not be appearing in public.
16693	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
16694	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.

16716	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
16719	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Then, in January 2006, he gave Prop?t 48 hours to pay $275,000 for a one-year license to use the images, warning that if the company did not agree to that offer, he would sue.
16721	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
16722	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.

16801	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	The Israeli army, which was not immediately available to comment on the incident, said two rockets were fired into Israel by militants in Gaza early Tuesday, landing without causing injuries or damage.
16803	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	Since then militants have fired more than 90 rockets at Israel, with 76 of them falling inside the Jewish state.
16806	AFP_ENG_20070116.0224.LDC2009T13	"The ceasefire with Israel is very important because, if Israel resumes assassinations and arrests it will destroy any chance of relaunching the peace process.

16883	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The border crossing that is the summer shortcut from the U.S. to Waterton is barricaded until summer.
16889	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But on the shore Waterton's Emerald Bay, a snug century-old lodge remains open, a beacon of warmth offering cozy rooms and an award-winning restaurant year around for those willing to make the offseason trek.
16892	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	We seek a blend of adventure and solitude, but also a comfortable bed, a warm fire, and gourmet meals served by cheerful and attentive staff.
16893	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Kilmorey offers it all.
16895	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Waterton plows a road eight miles (13 kilometers) up from the village into the high country of the Rockies.
16897	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It is one of the easiest and safest ways for winter visitors to view the high backcountry of the Canadian Rockies in winter.
16898	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Later in the season, when the ice is thicker and safer, Cameron Lake itself becomes a thoroughfare for skiers.
16901	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Deer are common here, and they often bed down in the shelter of trees near the Kilmorey.
16904	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This also is serious grizzly bear country, but they are hibernating this time of year and pose no threat.
16905	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Canada first protected Waterton as a park in 1895.
16907	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	His son, Louis Hill, chose a knoll overlooking Waterton as the spot for a new grand hotel, linked on a circuit to three others in Glacier park.
16912	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	At the townsite below, the wind is buffered by trees, and it is calm when we return to the Kilmorey after our adventure on skis.
16913	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	It makes for a pleasant evening stroll through the snow around the shore of the partially iced-over Emerald Bay, listening to the honking of hundreds of Canada geese.
16917	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	But all have antique furniture, plump mattresses and thick comforters that invite you to snuggle in and sleep late.
16920	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Dining at Kilmorey is a treat
16922	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The menu and wine list belie the isolation of the small lodge.
16923	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	This night we opt for an appetizer of black tiger prawns sauteed with maple-infused Canadian whisky and a hint of crushed garlic.
16924	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	For a main course we choose pescatorie -- scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab, calamari, cod and prawns sauteed with garlic, Italian herbs and onion and finished with sauvignon blanc and cream, then tossed with linguine.
16925	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Then we head to one of Kilmorey's most pleasant features -- the back library, with its comfy armchairs gathered around a wood- burning fireplace.
16928	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Perhaps we'll be snowed in.
16934	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	The lodge contains 23 guest rooms, two of which are wheelchair- accessible.
16935	APW_ENG_20070111.0138.LDC2009T13	Winter rates range from US$85-$168 (99 to 196 Canadian dollars), the latter for a two-room family suite

16948	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Facing elimination from the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Flyers rediscovered the ferocity they had displayed in the first two rounds, scoring three first-period goals and then holding off Pittsburgh, 4-2, before a capacity crowd of 19,972 at Wachovia Center.
16949	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"They had a good first period, we didn't, and that was the difference," Crosby said.
16953	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Jordan Staal scored Pittsburgh's goals in the third period, his second score coming with 5 minutes 49 seconds remaining.
16956	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We're going to need that urgency the rest of the way," Philadelphia coach John Stevens said.
16958	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	Then Crosby and Philadelphia center Mike Richards each received slashing and roughing penalties with 15 seconds left, resulting in a tangle of angry, sweating players near the Pittsburgh penalty box.
16967	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	The puck tipped off the stick of Pittsburgh defenseman Hal Gill.
16976	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	But Philadelphia ended the period with a 17-13 edge in shots.
16979	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	"We know they can come up and score any time in the game.
16981	NYT_ENG_20080516.0037.LDC2009T13	That gave us a cushion."
16985	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	On thousands of street corners, vendors sit all day at little wooden booths, pads of paper in hand, taking money from bettors, who return later to check results posted on lampposts or walls.
16988	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game.
16989	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	More than 40 people face criminal charges, mounds of documents have been seized and $6 million in cash has been confiscated.
16992	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	And to Brazilians, that says a lot about the ambiguous relationship between those who control the game and those who make and enforce the laws.
16993	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate," said Denise Frossard, a crusading former judge who became famous here in the 1990s for sending 14 bosses to jail.
16994	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering money," she added, "and contributes greatly to the problem of impunity in this country."
16995	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Playing the game is complicated but potentially lucrative.
16996	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Players can bet on any combination of two-, three- or four-digit numbers, the last two digits of which are associated with any one of 25 animals, ranging from the alligator to the turkey.
16998	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"If I dream of a rooster, well then of course I'll bet on a rooster," said Silvio Cunha, who works as a doorman at an apartment building here.
16999	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"When my mother comes to visit, I bet on her flight number, and when I get my telephone bill I bet on that number too.
17001	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	The animal game was created in the 1890s by the owner of a zoo here as a way to promote his venture.
17002	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	It became almost instantly popular, which soon led the government, fearing that money would be drained away from official lotteries, to ban it.
17003	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	For decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent campaigns to snuff it out.
17005	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Nevertheless it survives.
17012	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	In one of the most famous, "I Hit the Thousand," a lucky bettor exults at fulfilling the poor man's dream: "I won 500 smackers, and now I'm not going to work anymore."
17013	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Though many Brazilians are reluctant to acknowledge it, bicheiros also play a central, even essential, role in Carnival here.
17015	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	This year and last, directors of samba schools were killed shortly before Carnival in what the authorities described as murders related to disputes about control of the animal game.
17016	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Among those jailed in this most recent scandal was Ailton Guimaraes, president of the league of samba schools, who is said by authorities to be the animal game's boss of bosses.
17019	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"He's the one who brought an organizational sense and structure to the game," said Frossard, the former judge, who has been the target of assassination attempts that she attributes to hired guns in the pay of game kingpins.
17021	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Since the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have sought to expand their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known here as "nickel hunters."
17023	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	When the party governed Rio Grande do Sul, the home state of Brazil's justice minister, animal game kingpins donated $500,000 for the purchase of the party headquarters there, a former party official said at a parliamentary inquiry.
17024	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	At one point a tape was played in which a party fundraiser could be heard urging the chief of police to go easy on numbers runners.
17028	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	But the Senate refused to make the measure permanent.
17031	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"It's not a simple question," she said recently, but "it's obvious that as the investigations deepen, an institutional model for the question of games of chance is going to be delineated in Brazil."
17032	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Some Brazilians oppose legalization on moral grounds or because they fear that it would attract foreign crime organizations.
17033	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	Others are simply skeptical.
17034	NYT_ENG_20070606.0275.LDC2009T13	"I'd wager that legalization is never going to happen," Luiz Carlos Menezes de Sa, a waiter, predicted after placing a 50-cent bet on 3568, a number associated with the monkey.

17694	APW_ENG_20080118.0118.LDC2009T13	But if not -- and there's really no polite way to phrase this, so we're just going to throw it out there -- it's about a teenage girl who discovers that her vagina has teeth.

17831	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	"I just hate high-alcohol wines," said Randy Dunn, founder of Dunn Vineyards, who fired off an open letter last year urging consumers to demand wines of 14 percent alcohol or less.

17842	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	Wines containing 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol can be labeled just "table wine" or "light wine," as opposed to listing the alcohol content, under federal regulations.
17843	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	When a percentage is listed it can be off by up to 1.5 percent, a tolerance granted because one batch of wine may differ from another, said Art Resnick, spokesman for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in Washington, D.C. Wines over 14 percent alcohol, which fall into a higher tax category, must list alcohol levels with a tolerance of plus or minus 1 percent.
17844	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	The higher alcohol trend goes back about 10 years when growers started letting grapes stay on the vines longer to develop the full flavor of the fruit, said Kenneth Fugelsang, professor of enology and winemaster of the commercial winery run by California State University, Fresno.
17845	APW_ENG_20080226.0023.LDC2009T13	California seems to have been a leader, although higher alcohol wines are also being made in other warm climates, such as Australia, he said.

18418	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.

18423	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	As Huckabee and Romney sparred for the lead as the Thursday caucuses approach, a new poll showed a virtual three-way dead heat on the Democratic side, with New York Sen.

19159	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	CAIRO, Egypt 2007-09-07 01:21:47 UTC
19160	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
19164	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
19168	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"I think it works for their (al-Qaida's) benefit that he looks young, he looks healthy," Katz said.
19170	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Soon, God willing, a videotape from the lion sheik Osama bin Laden, God preserve him," the advertisement read, signed by Al- Sahab.
19172	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	IntelCenter, which monitors Islamic Web sites and analyzes terror threats, said the video was expected within the next 72 hours, before the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide hijacker attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
19173	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The anniversary has always been a major media event for al-Qaida -- a chance for it to drum up support among extremists, tout itself as the leading militant group and show off its continued survival.
19175	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"Historically the anniversary of 9-11 has never been drawn to attacks.
19176	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	It's drawn to video releases."
19178	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Whether the message will indicate a potential attack will depend on what bin Laden says.
19183	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	If bin Laden does appear in new footage, it would be the first images of him since an Oct. 29, 2004 videotape, just before the U.S. presidential elections.
19184	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
19187	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
19190	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.

19220	APW_ENG_20071214.0423.LDC2009T13	Opposition leader Brendan Nelson, who was defense minister before the election, questioned whether such a military deployment would harm relations with Japan, Australia's second most important trading partner after China.

19281	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	CHELSEA, Mass. - On Oct. 17, 2004, when the Red Sox revived their World Series hopes by beating the Yankees in the 12th inning of the must-win fourth game of the playoffs, Liberian-born Hassan Bility was in a hotel room in Sierra Leone.
19285	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I told them we believe," Bility says.
19286	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"We always believe."
19288	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In his native Monrovia, he was editor in chief of The Analyst, a newspaper that regularly reported on the violence and abuses of Taylor's presidency, both in Liberia and in the arms- for-diamonds war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
19289	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the most outspoken and courageous journalists in Liberia," says Joshua Rubenstein, New England director of Amnesty International.
19292	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close.
19295	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
19297	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He is a reluctant refugee, the subject of an international campaign for his release by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the US government.
19299	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was whisked from a Liberian prison to Ghana in December 2002, then resettled in Boston in early 2003.
19300	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He now speaks and writes about his troubled homeland.
19301	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Boston-educated Taylor, the first African head of state to be charged with war crimes, refused to attend the opening of his trial before the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone earlier this month.
19302	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The trial resumes Monday (eds: June 25) and is expected to last at least a year.
19304	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity - including mass murder, sexual slavery, rape, mutilation, and the use of child soldiers - for allegedly fomenting civil war in Sierra Leone to gain control of its abundant natural resources.
19305	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.
19306	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He returned in 1984, after being charged with embezzling Liberian government funds, only to be arrested here.
19311	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I thought the Liberian media wasn't reporting what was happening, either from fear or censorship," he says.
19312	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I felt it was necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
19313	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	During this period of chaos, West African peacekeepers managed to ring off the capital city of Monrovia, says Binaifer Nowrojee, former legal counsel for Human Rights Watch Africa.
19315	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says.
19318	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He was editor of The National newspaper at the time and writing about the proxy war in Sierra Leone, for which Taylor is now on trial.
19321	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	My colleagues said, 'You are reckless.
19323	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That was the battle line."
19325	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
19327	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
19328	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Government agents pretending to peddle a corruption story dragged Bility away in front of his crying 4 -year-old son.
19334	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He said, 'Have a seat.'
19335	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I sat on a chair.
19338	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility denied Taylor's assertions that he was smuggling arms into Liberia and arranging for the president's assassination.
19340	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
19342	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was sitting in a room with government agents who had been drinking, one, a renowned marksman, poured Scotch down Bility's throat, then balanced the Dewar's bottle on the blindfolded prisoner's head.
19343	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
19346	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
19349	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Through all this, Bility never made a false confession.
19350	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
19351	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His first inkling that his plight had attracted international attention occurred in the fall of 2002, when a guard slipped him a letter from Amnesty urging him to stay strong.
19352	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
19358	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He refused to go into exile.
19359	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
19362	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	American resettlement officials suggested he would like Washington or Boston.
19363	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
19367	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I thought I really didn't need it.
19370	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"What helped me was to speak about it.
19373	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility wants more, however.

19403	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	U.N. international staffers started returning in August 2004 and U.N. experts played key roles in helping Iraqis draft a new constitution and prepare for elections, but the numbers on the ground are limited because of increasing insecurity, especially in Baghdad.
19404	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	"The United Nations has been and will continue wherever and whenever we can to increase our presence there, but that will be largely constrained by the security concerns," Ban told reporters Wednesday.

19487	APW_ENG_20070620.0570.LDC2009T13	The United States should face commercial sanctions worth more than US$3.4 billion (euro2.5 billion) each year for its failure to comply with a World Trade Organization ruling that its Internet gambling restrictions are illegal, the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda said Wednesday.

19555	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Investors loved it.
19558	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	But with those markets now in turmoil, all of them are asking whether the yen carry trade is seeing its last days.
19560	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.
19562	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Turmoil in global markets in recent weeks had been encouraging investors to pull back, selling riskier securities and reducing the amount of money they owe.
19563	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Last week, that gradual unwinding turned into a race among carry traders to sell non-Japanese assets and convert the proceeds back into yen to pay off their loans.
19570	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Japan's steady if unspectacular economic recovery of recent years has been driven by export sales that are in part linked to the yen's low value against the dollar and other currencies.
19572	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	Some analysts said they believed the carry trade was a valuable financial tool that would return once markets stabilized.

19638	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	"Given continuing high levels of violence in Iraq and few manifestations of political compromise among Iraq's factions, the optimal outcome in Iraq of a unified, pluralist, democratic government that is able to police itself, protect its borders, and achieve economic development is not likely to be achieved in the near future," the Warner-Lugar proposal said.

19642	APW_ENG_20070713.1343.LDC2009T13	The Warner-Lugar proposal states that "American military and diplomatic strategy in Iraq must adjust to the reality that sectarian factionalism is not likely to abate anytime soon and probably cannot be controlled from the top."

19839	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	You can skip the mouth-to-mouth breathing and just press on the chest to save a life.
19843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
19845	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The odds are that the person is having cardiac arrest -- the heart suddenly stops -- which can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.
19848	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.

19851	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
19852	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
19853	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	those "unable or unwilling" to do the breaths could do presses alone.
19854	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Now the heart association has given equal standing to hands-only CPR.

19864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
19865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
19866	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Anonymous surveys show that people are reluctant to do mouth-to- mouth, Ewy said, partly because of fear of infections.

20068	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	In football and in life, Chicago Bears cornerback Ricky Manning has made mistakes.
20072	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Two field goals by Robbie Gould, the second one in the fifth minute of overtime, propelled the Bears to a 27-24 victory and catapulted Manning into his third National Football Conference championship game in four seasons.
20080	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was suspended for one game by the NFL for violation of its code of personal conduct, causing him to miss the Bears' 17-13 loss at New England on Nov. 26.

20084	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He was standing in the victorious home locker room at Soldier Field as he spoke, stuffing toiletries and clothes into a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.

20087	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Confronting his legal issues was just part of it.
20090	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"The last nine months has been a drastic change for me," Manning said.
20092	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But in a good way, he was quick to add.

20106	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	What happened at the Denny's in Los Angeles, not far from the UCLA campus where Manning attended college, was avoidable.
20107	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	He can see that clearly now.
20110	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	"Initially I reacted to getting disrespected when I thought I shouldn't have been," he added.
20113	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	But he was arrested nonetheless and his public image took a brutal hit.
20119	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Roughly 90 minutes after the game, Manning headed toward the exit, following the wedge created by his wife, Tosha, and his cousins.

20125	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	One did recognize him and, nudging another, whispered, "That's Ricky Manning," but by then, Manning had disappeared into the cold, rainy night.
20130	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Rudolph W. Giuliani's approach to foreign policy shares with other Republican presidential candidates an aggressive posture toward terrorism, a commitment to strengthening the military and disdain for the United Nations.
20131	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But in developing his views, Giuliani is consulting with, among others, a particularly hawkish group of advisers and neoconservative thinkers.
20133	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani's team includes Norman Podhoretz, a prominent neoconservative who advocates bombing Iran "as soon as it is logistically possible"
20138	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But their presence has reassured some conservatives who have expressed doubts about Giuliani's positions on issues like abortion and gun control, and underscored his efforts to cast himself as a tough-minded potential commander in chief.
20145	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
20148	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
20149	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	I believe it is."
20151	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
20152	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani rejects the democracy effort as premature and overly idealistic, noting that the policy led to the sweeping victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections.
20155	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
20157	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Kristol said that none of the leading Republican candidates "buy any of these fundamental criticisms that Bush took us on a radically wrong path, and we have to go to a pre-9/11 foreign policy."
20162	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
20167	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"This is the great fallacy in this now very strong Democratic desire to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and negotiate," he said.
20169	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy education of Giuliani, from former big-city mayor to would-be statesman, has played out in a series of briefings and papers and calls.

20288	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Condemnation of Bush Iraq plan mirrors failure to follow Baker ideas by David Millikin
20291	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
20292	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The decision to deepen US involvement in the unpopular war while foregoing diplomacy drew scathing criticism not only from opposition Democrats but also from some leaders of Bush's Republican party.
20293	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"I believe it's a tragic mistake," said Senator Joseph Biden, a 2008 Democratic presidential hopeful and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appeared before the panel Thursday to defend the Bush plan.
20294	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
20295	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	In stark contrast, the congressionally mandated Iraq Study Group, co-chaired by Baker, a Republican who served with Bush's father when he was president, and Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton, won wide praise for the proposals it submitted in early December.
20297	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	It also called for a broad diplomatic offensive that would involve Iran and Syria -- backers of anti-US insurgents and sectarian rivals in Iraq -- and include a major push to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as a source of tension and radicalization across the region.
20300	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The strategy released by Bush however reflected key elements of the Baker outline, including a need to boost training of Iraqi forces by "embedding" more US advisors and making US support conditional on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government meeting "benchmarks" for achieving security and political reconciliation.
20301	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"Contrary to earlier reports, America will now only surge if Nuri Maliki's government makes a deal to share oil wealth and reintegrate former Baathists, things it has shown no willingness to do," said Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations.
20305	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice argued that such negotiations were unacceptable because in exchange for their help stabilizing Iraq, Iran would insist Washington stop opposing its illicit nuclear program and Syria would demand a free hand in reasserting its control over neighboring Lebanon.
20307	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	A former State Department official who was instrumental in the work of the Iraq Study Group downplayed the differences with Bush's final plan and suggested the Democrats who now control Congress could still force the president's hand on the missing elements.
20314	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	But those who stay -- or come later -- will do so with Venezuela's government-controlled oil company in charge, Alvarez told the Houston Chronicle editorial board.
20315	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that rule," he said.
20320	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said he has not encountered hostility from Americans despite Washington's chilly relations with Chavez, a socialist who once likened President Bush to the devil.
20321	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
20326	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Last month, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil refused to accept new working terms for their Venezuelan operations and walked away.
20329	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	London-based BP and Norway's Statoil, which already were minority partners, also agreed to stay.
20332	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
20337	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
20339	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said other companies may be hesitant to invest when contracts could change in midstream.
20343	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, Esteruelas noted that in mid-May, the Venezuelan government said it might take over 18 oil rigs now operated by oil service companies and create a PDVSA subsidiary to tighten control of drilling operations throughout the country.
20344	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	That could prompt oil service companies to hold back on drilling expansion, he said.
20345	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
20346	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Its American assets -- notably five refineries run by its Houston-based subsidiary, Citgo -- could be targeted for seizure to compensate ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.
20348	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
20349	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.
20351	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He had no meetings scheduled with ConocoPhillips or Exxon Mobil.

20353	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	DUBLIN, Ireland 2008-07-24 18:42:40 UTC
20354	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Biopharmaceutical company Elan Corp.
20361	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke said Elan hoped to reach 100,000 Tysabri customers by the end of 2010, while current projections pointed to 90,000.
20363	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Three clinical users of Tysabri contracted a rare brain disease called PML, and two died.
20364	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
20365	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said neurologists and their MS patients in North America and Europe were increasingly confident that Tysabri -- widely acknowledged from the start as better at suppressing the effects of MS than older treatments -- was safe when used on its own.
20367	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.
20369	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke estimated there were 500,000 MS sufferers in the 35 countries where Tysabri has been approved for sale, split evenly between North America and Europe.
20370	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	He said close to 7 percent were already receiving Tysabri, while its end-of-2010 target means 20 percent would be.
20371	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Cooke said the treatment, which is administered every four weeks by intravenous infusion, retails for about US$30,000 (euro20,000) annually per patient following a recent 3 percent price rise.
20373	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	U.S. regulators in January also approved Tysabri for the most serious sufferers of an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease, and Elan said about 100 Crohn's patients are using the drug today.
20375	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan and its research partner, Wyeth, plan to present second- phase results for one potential Alzheimer's treatment, bapineuzumab, at a Chicago conference for neurologists Tuesday.
20376	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical trials.
20377	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Elan Chief Executive Kelly Martin said the company had spent 15 years researching to combat Alzheimer's, which afflicts an estimated 15 million people worldwide, a figure expected to double at least within the next decade.
20378	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"The Alzheimer's need is, unfortunately, immense," Martin said.
20379	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	"It is probably the largest single market that's as yet untapped by the biopharmaceutical industry."
20387	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK
20390	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	So he will propose revising the city's 15-year-old term-limits law, which restricts him and dozens of elected leaders to two-four year terms, those people said.
20392	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
20393	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
20397	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's strategy carries significant political risk.
20398	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Several polls, conducted over the last few months, show widespread support for keeping the law in place.
20400	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"A backdoor deal undermines the will of New Yorkers," said the New York City comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who plans to run for mayor next year.
20406	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	And, according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past, he "does not care what it costs" to win a third term.
20409	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
20415	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	In the business community, however, the idea of a Bloomberg third term is intensely popular.
20417	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	As the city's economy has become imperiled over the last two weeks, as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was sold, calls for a third term have multiplied.
20418	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg took pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms, traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and appearing on "Meet the Press" to field questions about the financial crisis.
20419	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
20420	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"He has the confidence of the business community and the executive ability to run the city," said Steve Ross, the chief executive of Related Cos., a major developer in the city.
20429	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
20434	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's plan would have an especially deep impact on the next mayor's race.
20436	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.
20437	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"I believe that most of those candidates who were thinking of running will probably wait for the next round," said former Mayor Ed Koch.
20440	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Quinn, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
20441	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg's decision to modify the law is all but certain to be used against him in the next mayoral campaign.

20568	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The clash of styles, however, ended up being a much closer battle than the Bruins would have preferred.
20569	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA survived scary second- half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with an 88-78 victory.
20572	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins will have to beat No. 3 Xavier, which advanced after a scintillating 79-75 overtime victory against No. 7 West Virginia.
20577	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Kevin Love scored a career-high 29 points and added 14 rebounds.
20580	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky cut the UCLA lead to 61-57 with less than seven minutes remaining when Tyrone Brazelton blew past Darren Collison for a layup.
20584	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins built their halftime lead with inside dominators.
20585	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Love had 15 first-half points while Keefe, who played sparingly this season, came off the bench for seven points in 10 minutes.
20588	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA will enter as a heavy favorite despite Xavier's 30-6 record and having a list of victories this season that includes Indiana, Virginia, Auburn, Georgia, Purdue and West Virginia.
20590	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	But the biggest question that Xavier will face heading into that game will be whether it can score against the Bruins' taut defense.
20592	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	The Bruins yield only 58 points a game and coach Ben Howland's philosophy is based around stopping the other team with a ferocious man-to-man defense.
20595	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	He turned the ball over four times and had only one assist in the Round of 32 against Texas A&amp
20598	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Overall, UCLA struggled against Western Kentucky's full-court pressure, turning the ball over 19 times.
20606	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract offers China a chance to become a key player in the global gold market.
20607	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It could also be a hedging tool for gold producers and a means to absorb excess liquidity, analysts said.
20608	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The key contract for June delivery was the first to take off, surging 9.98 percent to 230.95 yuan (about 31.65 U.S. dollars) per gram.
20609	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	This was followed by the daily limit rise of other contracts for July-to-December delivery.
20611	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract size was set at 1,000 grams, larger than the originally expected 300 grams, to discourage individual investors who lacked the ability to handle the risk.
20612	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Analysts said they believed investors would need at least 24,000 yuan to secure a futures contract, as most futures brokers would ask for a 12 percent cash deposit for each contract.
20616	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.
20617	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Global prices jumped more than 30 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979.
20621	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
20628	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It would also further develop the nascent futures industry.
20629	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Most new futures investors would be institutions seeking a hedging tool," said Zhang Yingying, a Galaxy Futures Broker gold analyst.
20631	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	She said, "the contract size could limit participation by individual investors, but in the long run both institutions and individuals would play an equal role."
20632	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zhao Yuanlin, a Guotai Jun'an Futures analyst, said the brokerage had received numerous inquiries about gold futures from individual stock investors recently.
20633	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.
20634	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, "I would first offer risk education to veteran stock investors, since even they lacked the experience for riskier futures trading," Zhao told Xinhua.
20637	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE said earlier that it would impose strict risk controls on gold futures.
20639	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.
20641	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	RISING STAR IN WORLD MARKET?
20643	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Zheng Xueqin, a Chicago Board Options Exchange senior counselor, agreed that "Shanghai could emerge as the third center of world gold trade, after New York and London."
20648	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold consumption by the country's manufacturing sector was about 9.2 percent of the global total, according to official data.
20651	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Gold futures could also provide a reservoir to absorb the country's excess liquidity, a major concern of the government amid the anticipated strong appreciation of the currency, which had already pushed asset prices up," said Zheng Runxiang, a senior gold investment analyst.
20653	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Trade at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the country's spot market, was 1,828 tons last year, with a total value of 316.5 billion yuan.

20668	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	He convened a meeting of his "war council" with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders just days before US commander General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker report to Congress on the progress of Bush's troop "surge" strategy.
20669	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker tell me if the kind of success we are now seeing (in Anbar) continues, it is possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces," Bush said before leaving Iraq a few hours later for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Australia.
20672	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"This is the last big gathering of the president's military advisors and the Iraqi leadership before the president decides on the way forward," Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said.
20680	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	On his first visit to Iraq since June 2006 and his third since the invasion, Bush also met tribal sheikhs from Anbar province who have given his administration hopes of a turnaround in the deadly Sunni insurgency unleashed after the toppling of Saddam Hussein in April 2003.
20681	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Opposition Democrats who control the House of Representatives and Senate have been pushing for months to force a deadline for US troops to leave.
20683	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In an address to raucously cheering Marines, Bush rejected the intensifying pressure from Congress and reiterated his controversial stand that the war in Iraq is a life-or-death struggle against Al-Qaeda extremists.
20685	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
20686	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
20689	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	But security officials said that shortly before Bush's arrival, two car bombs went off in Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi, killing four people and wounding 10.

20842	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The economic stimulus package that President Bush signed last week includes provisions aimed at pulling those rates down and reinvigorating a part of the mortgage market still stunned by problems with subprime borrowers that surfaced last year.
20843	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Jumbo mortgages -- those that exceed $417,000 -- got expensive as the credit crisis worsened.
20844	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Rattled investors stopped buying them.
20845	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
20848	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
20851	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The idea is that investor appetite for these larger loans will grow if they have backing from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
20855	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But they disagree on how low and on whether the benefits will be widespread enough to bolster the housing and mortgage markets, especially because the higher caps will be in place for a limited period, through the end of this year.
20856	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The most we can say right now is that there will be some opportunity for some borrowers to achieve perhaps some interest- rate relief on their jumbo mortgages," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey-based mortgage research firm.
20858	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Under the new plan, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits will be set to 125 percent of the median home price in every metropolitan statistical area.
20862	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
20865	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Federal regulators declined to comment on what they expect the loan limit to be in the Washington area, or on what geographic definition of the region they will use.

20872	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But just as she was about to get a new loan, the jumbo rates started climbing and never stopped.
20874	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	But the spread has widened since August to nearly a full percentage point, according to HSH Associates.
20875	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
20877	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Why should the average consumer care how investors react?
20879	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	If investors feel that the larger loans inject too much risk into the pool of mortgages offered to them, they will demand a higher yield, which translates to higher rates for borrowers, said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital.
20883	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
20884	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the spread could narrow from about a percentage point to 0.50 to 0.75.
20886	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.

21630	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Eleven people, including a U.S. Secret Service informant, have been charged in connection with the hacking of nine major retailers and the theft and sale of more than 41 million credit and debit card numbers, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
21638	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan said that while most of the victims were in the United States, officials still haven't identified all the people who had a card number stolen.
21640	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Sullivan said the alleged thieves weren't computer geniuses, just opportunists who used a technique called "wardriving," which involved cruising through different areas with a laptop and looking for accessible wireless Internet signals.
21642	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The information was stored on two servers in Ukraine and Latvia -- one with more than 25 million credit and debit card numbers and another with more than 16 million numbers, Sullivan said.
21648	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	According to the indictments unsealed Tuesday, three of the defendants are U.S. citizens, one is from Estonia, three are from Ukraine, two are from China and one is from Belarus.
21652	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The thefts were criminal actions committed for the personal gain of the defendants, who investigators did not consider a national security threat, Chertoff said.
21653	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Still, he said, their alleged crimes demonstrated the weaknesses of cybersecurity in the U.S.
21654	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Today's indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every American faces in the 21st century -- the fact that each individual's greatest asset is their names, their identity," Chertoff said.
21657	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez was a U.S. Secret Service informant who helped the agency take over a Web site being used to transmit stolen identifiers and stolen credit card numbers, U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said at the news conference.
21659	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	But he said the Secret Service later found out that Gonzalez had also been feeding criminals information about ongoing investigations -- even warning off at least one person.
21660	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	"Obviously, we weren't happy that a person working for us as an informant was double-dealing," Mark Sullivan said.
21661	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Indictments were also unsealed Tuesday in San Diego against Maksym "Maksik" Yastremskiy of Kharkov, Ukraine, and Aleksandr "Jonny Hell" Suvorov of Sillamae, Estonia.
21662	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	They are charged with crimes related to the sale of the stolen credit card data.
21663	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Yastremskiy was arrested when he traveled to Turkey on vacation in July 2007.
21664	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	He is facing related Turkish charges, and U.S. officials said they have requested his extradition.
21669	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	Officials did not give an arraignment date for Gonzalez.
21671	APW_ENG_20080806.0063.LDC2009T13	The charges stemmed from allegations that they hacked into a national restaurant chain's computerized cash registers and stole credit card information from customers.

22134	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Fundamentally, however, they are all part of the same story -- the story of the global economy purging itself of large and unsustainable imbalances that for a time allowed many Americans to think they were richer than they really were.
22137	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Put another way, residential real estate is finding a new equilibrium, that magical place in the economist's imagination where supply and demand of houses and mortgages come back into some sort of rough balance at a lower price.
22138	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But the thing to remember is that it's not just residential real estate.
22139	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The same factors that were behind the housing bubble were also at work, to varying degrees, in the auto bubble, the commercial real estate bubble, the travel bubble, the college tuition bubble, the retail bubble, the Web 2.0 bubble and most recently the commodities bubble.
22146	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	But in the short run, it has played havoc with the cost of commodities, most of which are priced in dollars.
22148	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	At the same time, some of the excess credit that financed mortgages and corporate takeovers has been shifted to commodity speculation, turbocharging the swings in prices of everything from corn futures to jet fuel.
22153	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	That includes such things as cleaning planes

22161	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	Sad to say, it was no less a part of the previous economic mirage than the no-doc subprime loans, Google at $750 a share and takeover deals financed at 80 percent leverage.
22162	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	What I've described is a double whammy for American households: the slower growth that comes with downsizing a number of key industries that expanded as a result of the credit bubble, along with rising prices for a food, energy, health care and almost everything imported.
22169	LTW_ENG_20080529.0008.LDC2009T13	The other is to accept lower levels of government service and subsidies, which inevitably will lower the incomes of some households while forcing others to go without services or pay for them privately.
