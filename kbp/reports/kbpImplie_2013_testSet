sentenceOffset/Text 583: It was the sort of unromanticized scene, mundane with an edge of mordancy, that Pekar might have liked to preserve in his long-running series of autobiographical comics, American Splendor, or in one of his many graphic novels.

sentenceOffset/Text 819: But when Pekar died at 70 on July 12 -- suddenly it seemed to some, but in painful stages as those closest to him knew -- it brought an end to his compulsive chronicling of Cleveland's commonplace lives, including, most frequently, his own.

Cleveland's commonplace lives	cleveland	city

sentenceOffset/Text 1069: Known for the irascible, self-doubting persona he cultivated in American Splendor and his day-to-day existence, the frizzy-haired, wild-eyed Pekar, a writer whose comics were illustrated by other artists, was an improbable candidate for lasting glory.

sentenceOffset/Text 1870: But no matter how it plays out, Pekar is bound to emerge as enigmatic as ever.


sentenceOffset/Text 1958: As Dean Haspiel, an artist who worked with Pekar in his final years, said in an interview, "There was never one version of Harvey."

sentenceOffset/Text 2188: Beginning in the 1970s, when Pekar, a longtime file clerk at a Veterans Affairs hospital, started writing American Splendor at the suggestion of the cartoonist R. Crumb, he enjoyed brief brushes with fame, and he was a recurring guest on "Late Night With David Letterman" in the 1980s.

sentenceOffset/Text 2703: "There was always this dichotomy with Pekar," said Joseph Remnant, a Los Angeles illustrator who started working with him in 2008.

sentenceOffset/Text 3195: "He would still send faxes, long after no one else was sending faxes," said Josh Neufeld, who drew Pekar's stories for 13 years.


sentenceOffset/Text 3463: Brabner, however, coped with Pekar's fragility along with his idiosyncrasies.


sentenceOffset/Text 3837: When Pekar was recently given another diagnosis of lymphoma, Brabner said she knew "he was really winding down."


sentenceOffset/Text 4920: Facing Pekar's degeneration, Brabner said, "it was my job to be the dragon, to be the guardian, to be the distraction."


sentenceOffset/Text 5049: Among the illustrators Pekar began working with in his final months was Tara Seibel, a Cleveland graphic artist.

sentenceOffset/Text 5485: Seibel made no secret of her admiration for the pioneering comic work of Pekar, whom she described as "a 70-year-old hipster who loved listening to the Beastie Boys in the car."


sentenceOffset/Text 5995: Hosted by the website of Smith magazine, an online publication, the Pekar Project published more or less weekly installments written by Pekar and drawn by a rotating team that also included Remnant and the artists Sean Pryor and Rick Parker.


sentenceOffset/Text 6969: The arrangement was different from what Pekar and Brabner were used to.


sentenceOffset/Text 7217: But Pekar agreed to it because "he understood that you have to promote yourself, and you have to be out there constantly," Haspiel said.


sentenceOffset/Text 7394: As the Pekar Project continued, it became apparent that Brabner was displeased with one contributor in particular: Seibel, the only female artist involved, and the only one who worked face to face with Pekar.

sentenceOffset/Text 7612: Seibel, whose husband and three children also became acquainted with Pekar, said Brabner would abruptly pull Pekar out of their telephone conversations, and that she tried to interfere with a Brooklyn book-signing event at which Seibel appeared with Pekar in November.


sentenceOffset/Text 7881: Seibel said Pekar told her these conflicts were "for him to worry about," not her.


sentenceOffset/Text 8063: No one in their artistic circle believes the relationship between Pekar and Seibel crossed professional boundaries, but some could see how it strained Pekar's marriage.


sentenceOffset/Text 8523: Not even Pekar's death quelled the tensions between Seibel, who has said she spent part of his last day alive with him, and Brabner.


sentenceOffset/Text 9416: Brabner said Pekar left no formal will but might have signed a draft still buried among his papers.


sentenceOffset/Text 10105: Remnant is illustrating a graphic novel called "Harvey Pekar's Cleveland," about the city's history and Pekar's upbringing, for a new imprint called Zip Comics.

sentenceOffset/Text 10266: Random House is publishing at least two more of his graphic books: one, called "Huntington, West Virginia, 'On the Fly,"' in which Pekar reflects on promoting his movie and other books, and a second, written with Brabner, called "Harvey and Joyce's Big Book of Marriage."

sentenceOffset/Text 10742: Haspiel, who illustrated Pekar's 2005 autobiographical work "The Quitter," said Pekar's prolific output might have stemmed from his fears that he would die of Alzheimer's disease, as both of his parents did.


sentenceOffset/Text 11169: Neufeld, an American Splendor artist, said he was skeptical about whether the coming books would add to Pekar's reputation.

sentenceOffset/Text 11293: Emphasizing his reverence for Pekar and his work, Neufeld said, "I don't think they're going to be all that consequential in relation to all the other stuff he did."


sentenceOffset/Text 11531: For now Brabner said her priority was burying Pekar's ashes, near a spot in Cleveland where they walked on dates that he wrote about in American Splendor.

sentenceOffset/Text 1185: That evening Mays, who was scheduled to have hip-replacement surgery on Monday, told his wife that he was not feeling well, and after eating dinner he went to bed, she told investigators.


sentenceOffset/Text 1373: Dugan said there was no initial indication that the airplane incident had played a role in Mays' death.


sentenceOffset/Text 1486: With his twinkling eyes, distinctive bushy beard and booming voice, Mays energetically scrubbed away stains on his way to becoming an infomercial star.


sentenceOffset/Text 2016: Part of Mays' appeal was his apparent conviction in the products he sold.


sentenceOffset/Text 2249: Recently, Mays paired up with Anthony Sullivan, an infomercial veteran, in a reality show called "Pitchman" on the Discovery Channel that tracks the two as they search for new products and create new ads.


sentenceOffset/Text 2463: "I'll always remember his booming voice -- him saying 'Hi, Billy Mays here,"' Sullivan said in an e-mailed statement.

sentenceOffset/Text 3625: But days after Mays died, Sullivan organized a historic telephone meeting with more than 30 people who had commercials featuring the legendary pitchman.


sentenceOffset/Text 3778: In the end, the message was clear: Billy would have wanted the show to go on.


sentenceOffset/Text 3945: He's selling a new product based on the OxiClean brand Mays made famous, voicing a commercial originally planned to feature his former partner.


sentenceOffset/Text 4098: The number of commercials featuring Mays has dipped, from 12 to 15 regularly airing just before his death to five or six currently, according to the Infomercial Monitoring Service.


sentenceOffset/Text 4390: "You pull Billy's commercials off the air, and you're talking about $5 million a week just in advertising, and people start to lose jobs," said Sullivan, well aware that some have criticized the decision to keep airing his spots.


sentenceOffset/Text 4620: "Some agencies were stressing because </P> <P> . . . if they cut Billy's commercials, they've got to fire five people.


sentenceOffset/Text 4843: For Sullivan, the question of taking over Mays' former accounts was resolved by asking a simpler question.


sentenceOffset/Text 4984: "I'd rather have Sully doing this than some stranger, or some hotshot trying to be the next Billy Mays," said the guy who actually is the next Billy Mays, his son Billy Mays III.


sentenceOffset/Text 5163: Now 23, the youngest Mays is building his own tributes to his father establishing a blog, www.wheresbillymays.com , sending free stickers of his dad's likeness to fans and messaging them regularly through Twitter youngbillymays.


sentenceOffset/Text 5401: Mays broke the news of his father's death to many fans on Twitter, sending a message at 10:55 a.m. that day: "My dad didn't wake up this morning.


sentenceOffset/Text 5632: That evenhanded attitude emerged in young Billy minutes after hearing of his father's death, courtesy of a memory from February, when his dad helped him cope with losing all his possessions in an apartment fire.


sentenceOffset/Text 5853: "He said, 'What you don't realize when something like this is happening, is that when you get through it, you're at a way better level when it's over,' " Mays said.


sentenceOffset/Text 6124: Now working as a production assistant on Sullivan's shoots, Mays is keeping a low profile while developing plans for a nonprofit foundation.


sentenceOffset/Text 6388: "At the funeral, that whole time I felt a lot of people wanted me to . . . and I kind of felt like I should," said Mays, who wore his father's trademark blue shirt and khaki pants in tribute.


sentenceOffset/Text 6764: The Hillsborough County Medical Examiner released a final autopsy Aug. 7 that said Mays died of heart disease with cocaine use as a contributory cause.


sentenceOffset/Text 6916: The report said tests revealed the presence of substances produced by the body when it breaks down cocaine, leading to the conclusion Mays used the drug in the days before his death.


sentenceOffset/Text 7681: The younger Mays said his stepmother, Deborah, visited the medical examiner's office with a lawyer, opposing the mention of cocaine in the final report.

sentenceOffset/Text 7843: "It's so speculative, like saying he had a bacon cheeseburger and that contributed to his hypertension," said Mays.


sentenceOffset/Text 7959: The family quickly released a statement saying they were disappointed by the report and that they never saw the elder Mays use nonprescription drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 8886: His goal: Make the show a bigger, better tribute to Mays and the industry he loved.

sentenceOffset/Text 3010: Anderson was hired by the Tigers in 1979, not because the team was off to a slow start.

sentenceOffset/Text 3564: As much as he respected Moss, and didn't relish the thought of pulling the managerial rug out from under him after just two months, Campbell feared if he didn't immediately hire Anderson, another team would.


sentenceOffset/Text 3781: Anderson was fired after the 1978 season by the Reds - despite managing the Big Red Machine to two World Series titles and forging a deep relationship with the city that Anderson would opt to enter the Hall of Fame as a member of the Reds.


sentenceOffset/Text 4030: So, after returning to Detroit from a trip to Los Angeles, Campbell fired Moss and hired Anderson.


sentenceOffset/Text 4138: Later that week at the news conference introducing him, Anderson won over Tigers fans by saying the team had potential and might even "catch lightning in a bottle" right away.

sentenceOffset/Text 5494: Anderson stopped in his tracks.


sentenceOffset/Text 5535: His team was off to an incredible start, making headlines everywhere, and a Reds fan from Dayton had no idea Anderson still had a job.

sentenceOffset/Text 5806: "You're right, Georgie," Anderson used to tell George Scherger, one of his coaches in Cincinnati.


sentenceOffset/Text 6056: Besides, the real world was so vivid in Anderson's mind - what with his memories from Bridgewater, S.D., his birthplace - he never forgot it.

sentenceOffset/Text 7635: Quote machine </P> <P> Anderson, though, got along with the media - and the media got along with him.

sentenceOffset/Text 9969: In addition to being the first man to manage teams in both leagues to World Series titles (the Reds in 1975-76 and the Tigers in 1984), Anderson was the first manager with 100-win seasons in both leagues.

sentenceOffset/Text 10999: Anderson refused to manage replacement players.


sentenceOffset/Text 11102: Despite his long service with the Tigers, the team never retired Anderson's No. 11.


sentenceOffset/Text 11195: Later, Anderson spoke with regret about managing too long, saying he should have retired a few years earlier than he did.

sentenceOffset/Text 13806: From the mid-1940s, Cunningham began using other composers as well, including David Tudor, Christian Wolff, Earle Brown, Morton Feldman and Toshi Ichiyanagi and in recent years Brian Eno, Gavin Bryars and (in 2009) Sonic Youth.

sentenceOffset/Text 1820: Cunningham also abandoned conventional storytelling through ballet to focus entirely on the poetry of dance.


sentenceOffset/Text 2244: The choreographer, who gave sold out performances in European capitals before gaining national fame, said the Merce Cunningham Trust was needed "because dancing is a process that never stops, and should not stop if it is to stay alive and fresh."


sentenceOffset/Text 2607: After the tour, the foundation will formally close and the dance company will disband, but the trust will live on to manage Cunningham's works.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: MERCE CUNNINGHAM PLANS FOR HIS LEGACY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Merce Cunningham, the nonagenarian choreographer, is planning for a world without him.

Merce Cunningham, the nonagenarian choreographer	choreographer	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 206: He has decided that when he dies, or when the right time comes, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company will embark on a final two-year international tour and then shut down, the Cunningham Dance Foundation, which supports the company, announced on Tuesday.


sentenceOffset/Text 468: By other provisions of the plan, the Merce Cunningham Trust will take control of Cunningham's dances for licensing purposes; the dancers will each receive a year's salary as severance and extra money to help find new careers; staff members and the musicians who play for his performances will also receive payments.


sentenceOffset/Text 793: Meanwhile, Cunningham associates will prepare detailed records of the dances so they can be licensed and given authentic productions by other companies.


sentenceOffset/Text 1048: The plan is Cunningham's effort to confront the vexing problem of how choreography created by a lone master and interpreted by a dedicated company should be treated once the master has died.


sentenceOffset/Text 1274: Cunningham associates say the plan can serve as a model for other creative artists, particularly choreographers with their own companies, to protect their legacies.


sentenceOffset/Text 1439: At the least, it should help Cunningham's body of work avoid the ugliness that surrounded the legacy of Martha Graham (who gave Cunningham his start in dance) after her death in 1991.


sentenceOffset/Text 1783: "It's really a concern about how do you preserve the elements of an art which is really evanescent, which is really like water," Cunningham said in an interview last week.


sentenceOffset/Text 2159: Cunningham did not attend because, foundation officials said, he was uncomfortable discussing the matter in public.


sentenceOffset/Text 2275: One of the company's dancers, Daniel Madoff, surrounded by eight colleagues, said, "It deeply saddens us to think about a future without Merce."


sentenceOffset/Text 2585: It certainly goes into effect on Cunningham's death, but he could also make the decision beforehand.


sentenceOffset/Text 3093: "It'll be clear," Sperling said, based on Cunningham's capacities in the future.


sentenceOffset/Text 3183: "He's the key to the whole thing," Sperling added, noting that some board members had suggested that the winding down begin now, but that Cunningham refused.


sentenceOffset/Text 3350: "I don't want to drop it," Cunningham said.


sentenceOffset/Text 3480: At some points in the interview Cunningham appeared to contradict the documents prepared by the foundation, which included clear references to the company's eventual closing.


sentenceOffset/Text 3939: Sperling said Cunningham had mentioned the possibility of the trust's keeping on a few dancers to teach his works at other companies.


sentenceOffset/Text 4082: Cunningham added that he can accept the company's future closing.


sentenceOffset/Text 4398: Another uncertainty is whom Cunningham will name as successor trustees, and thus who will control his legacy.


sentenceOffset/Text 4508: They are likely to come from his closest associates, who include Robert Swinston, his assistant; Trevor Carlson, the foundation's executive director; and Laura Kuhn, executive director of the trust for the composer John Cage, Cunningham's longtime collaborator and companion.

Trevor Carlson, the foundation's executive director	executive director	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 4793: The plan calls for the Cunningham trust, which was established in 2000, to assume control of Cunningham's personal art collection, including works by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, who each designed sets for him.


sentenceOffset/Text 5013: It will also take charge of the sets, props, costumes, archives and the digital "capsule" of each dance, which will include video, audio, lighting designs, and production notes.The final two-year tour will offer a "triumphant conclusion to the creation phase of Merce's work," a document outlining the plan says.


sentenceOffset/Text 5335: Cunningham has stipulated that tickets to New York performances should cost $10.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: DON HEWITT, ' 60 MINUTES '  CREATOR, DIES AT 86 WALTER GOODMAN, WHO DIED IN 2002, CONTRIBUTED REPORTING.


sentenceOffset/Text 186: NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> Don Hewitt, who changed the course of broadcast news by creating the television magazine "60 Minutes," fusing journalism and show business as never before, and who then presided over the much-copied program for nearly four decades, died Wednesday at his home in Bridgehampton, N.Y.

NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> Don Hewitt	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 630: Hewitt said in an interview on March 18 that doctors had detected a cancerous tumor on his pancreas, and that he was being admitted to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for treatment.


sentenceOffset/Text 828: During a career at CBS News that lasted more than half a century, Hewitt served as a living bridge -- from the birth of television journalism in the long shadow of radio, through its golden-age as an unrivaled fixture in dens and family rooms, to its middle-age present, under siege from the Internet.


sentenceOffset/Text 2151: Within a few years, "60 Minutes" had achieved something that had heretofore been the province of comedies like those featuring Jackie Gleason and Lucille Ball, as opposed to news programs: It became a ratings juggernaut, taking up residence among the top 10 shows on prime-time television for more than two decades, and earning the network "maybe $2 billion," Hewitt once estimated.


sentenceOffset/Text 3284: In more than 35 years at the helm of "60 Minutes," which he led from its founding in 1968 to his departure, under pressure, at age 82 in 2004, Hewitt made stars (and millionaires) not only of Rather, Wallace, and Stahl, but also of Morley Safer, Ed Bradley, Steve Kroft and Andy Rooney.


sentenceOffset/Text 3571: While theirs were the faces that, collectively, opened the program for decades each Sunday night at 7 ET (or a bit later during football season), the program viewers ultimately saw was largely forged by Hewitt's off-camera guiding hand.


sentenceOffset/Text 3817: Having been fired in the mid-1960s as executive producer of Cronkite's "CBS Evening News" -- Fred Friendly, who was president of CBS News at the time, faulted Hewitt for his emphasis on "lots of dazzle, lots of pace" -- Hewitt used his brief time in exile within the news division headquarters on West 57th Street to conceive a program that he likened to a broadcast version of Life magazine.

sentenceOffset/Text 4219: As in a general-interest magazine, Hewitt reasoned, "60 Minutes" -- named for the hour of prime time the network would give him each week -- would toggle between hard news and soft.


sentenceOffset/Text 6026: Neufeld added: "The concept of a mini-documentary was original, and it was Don Hewitt's."


sentenceOffset/Text 6125: But by demonstrating that news could deliver big audiences at a fraction of the cost of a scripted comedy or drama, Hewitt and "60 Minutes" also ushered in an era in television in which reality would become routinely wrapped in the gilt of excess and sensationalism.


sentenceOffset/Text 6905: Soon, the sense of balance, in terms of the mix of stories, for which Hewitt had strived in the early years of "60 Minutes" was thrown to the wayside by a slew of early-evening entertainment news shows, which focused exclusively on gossip and stories from movie and TV sets that were often spoon-fed.


sentenceOffset/Text 7206: The boom in so-called reality television -- whether "Wife Swap" on ABC or "Jon &amp; Kate" on TLC -- could also be traced, at least in part, to a run-amok reimagining of Hewitt's sense that real life, with a little prodding, could yield riveting stories at a relatively bargain-basement price.


sentenceOffset/Text 7961: In what he later regarded as one of the darkest periods of his career, Hewitt capitulated in 1995 to CBS' demand that he kill a "60 Minutes" piece based on interviews with a so-called "insider" from the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company.


sentenceOffset/Text 8678: Among those sharply and publicly critical of Hewitt's acquiescence were Wallace, the correspondent on the segment, and Lowell Bergman, the segment producer.

sentenceOffset/Text 8986: In his 2001 memoir, Hewitt said his hands had been tied by the network's lawyers.

sentenceOffset/Text 9789: The son of a former classified advertising manager for the Boston American who later ran a company that sold circulars door-to-door, the young Hewitt found himself pulled toward two seemingly opposite poles as he logged endless hours in the local movie house.

sentenceOffset/Text 10425: A year after enrolling in New York University on a track scholarship, Hewitt dropped out.

New York University	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 11106: His new job as the night editor at Acme Telepictures, a photo agency, led to a fortuitous job offer: A friend told Hewitt that CBS, known primarily for its radio work, was looking for someone with picture experience to join its new effort to produce television programming.


sentenceOffset/Text 11405: Hewitt recalled asking.


sentenceOffset/Text 11514: "So I went down to Grand Central Terminal, and damned if they didn't have it, up on the top floor -- little pictures in a box," Hewitt wrote in "Tell Me a Story" "They also had cameras and lights and makeup artists and stage managers and microphone booms just like in the movies, and I was hooked."


sentenceOffset/Text 11822: Hewitt eventually separated from his first wife.


sentenceOffset/Text 12100: She survives him, as do two sons, Jeffrey and Steven, from his first marriage; two daughters, Lisa Cassara and Jilian Hewitt, from his second marriage; and three grandchildren.


sentenceOffset/Text 12287: Though Hewitt remained under contract as a consultant to CBS after his departure from "60 Minutes," he returned to prime time in 2007 as an executive producer for an hour-long program broadcast on a rival network, NBC.


sentenceOffset/Text 12749: Asked at the time how he had enjoyed the experience -- in which he directed two co-hosts, Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira; posed with the Rockettes, and commandeered nine high-definition cameras that Murrow and Edwards would have hardly recognized -- Hewitt said it had been the thrill of a very rich lifetime.

sentenceOffset/Text 1155: Late in his career as a founding member of sports television's most-celebrated triumvirate, the announcing team for ABC's "Monday Night Football," Meredith turned up at a production meeting before a game, rolling in a blackboard with a great show of purpose.

sentenceOffset/Text 2296: No one is saying Romo is a franchise quarterback just yet, but he's well on his way.


sentenceOffset/Text 3510: The Cowboys have had franchise quarterbacks in parts of the last five decades for one reason: pure luck.

sentenceOffset/Text 427: The cause was esophageal cancer, said Gwathmey's stepson, Eric Steel.


sentenceOffset/Text 506: Gwathmey was part of a generation of architects who put their own aesthetic stamp on the "high Modernist" style developed in the early 20th century by Le Corbusier and others.


sentenceOffset/Text 682: Many of Gwathmey's best buildings were houses.


sentenceOffset/Text 972: Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, which Gwathmey founded with Robert Siegel in 1968, was a rare architecture firm to maintain a thriving residential practice (its first apartment, in 1969, was for the actress Faye Dunaway) while also creating large buildings for schools, museums and private real estate developers.

sentenceOffset/Text 1811: Among architects, Gwathmey was admired for his steadfastness during the 1980s, when some of his contemporaries turned to historicist, or post-Modernist styles.


sentenceOffset/Text 2244: She did so, she said, after realizing that "there's a lot of interest in Charles's work among the younger generation of architects."


sentenceOffset/Text 2470: Gwathmey (pronounced GWAHTH-mee) himself was a dashing figure, given to Savile Row suits and shoes from the London boot maker John Lobb.


sentenceOffset/Text 2762: He became a sensation while still in his 20s, when, with his partner at the time, Richard Henderson, he designed a house for his parents, Robert and Rosalie Gwathmey, both artists, on the East End of Long Island.

time, Richard Henderson	henderson	city

sentenceOffset/Text 2975: Completed in 1966, at a cost of $35,000, the Gwathmey house attracted throngs of visitors and was consistently named one of the most influential buildings of the modern era.


sentenceOffset/Text 3158: Gwathmey described the house -- a 1,200-square-foot cedar-clad composition of cubes, triangles and cylinders -- as "a solid block that has been carved back to its essence."


sentenceOffset/Text 3457: Gwathmey thought of the house and its adjoining studio as sculptures.


sentenceOffset/Text 3602: In 2001 Gwathmey inherited the house from his mother and began a renovation that included covering the original concrete floor with marble.


sentenceOffset/Text 3742: The upgrade was a sign of Gwathmey's extraordinary success during the intervening years.


sentenceOffset/Text 4113: He added that Gwathmey "liked to mix it up" -- liked to take strong stands in defense of his design ideas -- but "if there hadn't been the sparks, the architecture wouldn't have been as brilliant."


sentenceOffset/Text 4320: Though lavish, Gwathmey's residential designs were more about "This is who I am" than "This is what I've got," Steel said.


sentenceOffset/Text 4443: But they also reflected Gwathmey's predilections for using angles and curves to create interlocking spaces, usually framed by materials like onyx, stainless steel and bird's-eye maple.


sentenceOffset/Text 4637: Gwathmey formed his partnership with Siegel in 1968.


sentenceOffset/Text 5822: In the end Gwathmey settled on a limestone slab that entirely defers to Wright's powerful building.


sentenceOffset/Text 6208: More recently, Gwathmey designed the Astor Place condominiums, a curvy glass building in the East Village.


sentenceOffset/Text 6792: Gwathmey was widely praised for bringing Rudolph's architecture back to life.


sentenceOffset/Text 7029: Still, Gwathmey took pride in having completed a building at Yale, his alma mater, that engaged in a conversation with Rudolph's building, as well as with the 1953 Yale University Art Gallery by Louis I. Kahn across the street.

sentenceOffset/Text 7266: Eisenman said that Gwathmey deserved more credit than he got for making sure that his building didn't overpower its neighbors.


sentenceOffset/Text 7393: "Charles was able to sublimate his ego and produce really sophisticated solutions to plan problems, to circulation problems -- but those aren't the kinds of things that make headlines," Eisenman said.


sentenceOffset/Text 7603: Charles Gwathmey was born on June 19, 1938, in Charlotte, N.C., and was reared both there and in New York City.

sentenceOffset/Text 7977: Fresh from that trip, he made a splash with his parents' house, in Amagansett, N.Y., and soon became known as one of five young architects -- Gwathmey was the youngest -- who were reinterpreting Corbusian convention.


sentenceOffset/Text 8203: The group, known variously as the Five or the Whites (for the color of most of their buildings) or the New York School, consisted of Gwathmey, Michael Graves, Eisenman, John Hejduk and Richard Meier.

New York School	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 8751: Over the years Gwathmey taught at a number of architecture schools, including those of Harvard, Yale and Princeton and, in Manhattan, of Columbia and Cooper Union.

sentenceOffset/Text 774: Sri Lanka-born Rajaratnam, a onetime billionnaire who founded the Galleon Group of hedge funds, and Chiesi have pleaded not guilty to securities fraud charges alleging they shared inside information.


sentenceOffset/Text 1021: A spokesman for Rajaratnam's lawyers was not immediately available for comment.


sentenceOffset/Text 1180: In a related ruling Wednesday, Holwell said Rajaratnam and Chiesi can be tried together on some charges but not on others.

sentenceOffset/Text 2300: Lawyers for Rajaratnam and Chiesi argued that the wiretaps should be disallowed because federal law does not authorize the use of wiretaps to detect insider trading and because information provided to judges who approved them was insufficient.


sentenceOffset/Text 3011: Holwell added that Rajaratnam and Chiesi "would have this court bar the government from using wiretaps for wire fraud investigation whenever the fraud concerns securities.


sentenceOffset/Text 3289: To some extent, Holwell agreed that the wiretaps application was insufficient, saying Rajaratnam had proven that the government's application "omitted and misstated important information regarding the credibility of a key government informant."
