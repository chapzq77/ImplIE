<P>
Physicist Andrew E. Lange, co-leader of an international team that produced a detailed image of remnants of the Big Bang showing the universe is flat, has died in an apparent suicide, police said Tuesday. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
Lange was a physicist at the California Institute of Technology. University President Jean-Lou Chameau notified the institution in an e-mail that Lange apparently took his own life on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lange checked into a hotel Thursday and the next morning housekeepers found him dead, apparently due to asphyxiation, said police Detective Lt. John Dewar.
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a suicide," Dewar said.
</P>
<P>
Lange recently resigned as chairman of the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, Caltech said.
</P>
<P>
Lange was best known as co-leader of project "Boomerang," which in 1998 used a telescope, carried over Antarctica by a balloon for 10 1/2 days, to study the so-called cosmic microwave background -- a gas of thermal radiation left over from the embryonic universe.
</P>
<P>
The experiment showed the spatial geometry of the universe is flat and supported theories that it will expand forever and not collapse upon itself.
</P>
<P>
The observations were considered the first detailed images of the infant universe, according to Caltech. They largely matched predictions and suggested that scientists are on the right track in understanding the earliest moments of the universe, its age and the amount of so-called dark matter that holds galaxies together.
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible triumph of modern cosmology to have predicted their basic form so accurately," Lange said when the research was published in 2000.
</P>
<P>
A flat universe also supports the "inflation" theory that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in a fraction of a nanosecond after its birth.
</P>
<P>
Lange and Italian team leader, Paolo De Bernardis of Rome's La Sapienza university, were awarded one of Italy's 2006 Balzan prizes, annual awards of 1 million Swiss francs, for contributions to cosmology. (Boomerang was short for Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics.)
</P>
<P>
Lange was born July 23, 1957, in Illinois. He graduated from Princeton University in 1980, received a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1987, and was a visiting associate at Caltech in 1993-94. He was appointed a full professor in 1994 and was named the Marvin L. Goldberger Professor of Physics in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, he became a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was appointed chairman of Caltech's physics, mathematics and astronomy division in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Lange had three young sons, according to the university. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

ANDREW LANGE, SCHOLAR OF THE COSMOS, DIES AT 52
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lange, an astrophysicist whose balloon-borne measurements
of light left over from the Big Bang played a key role in
elucidating the shape and nature of the universe, was found dead on
Jan. 22 in Los Angeles. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
His death was announced by Jean-Lou Chameau, the president of
the California Institute of Technology, where Lange had until
recently been chairman of the division of physics, mathematics and
astronomy. Chameau said Lange appeared to have taken his own life.
</P>
<P>
Lange devoted his career to a haze of faint microwaves that
pervade the sky, providing a whispery ghost image of the universe
when it was only 400,000 years old, before there were stars,
galaxies or even atoms.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1990s, this work put him in the middle of one of the
grandest quests in science, the effort to discern the fate of the
universe -- whether it would keep expanding forever or collapse one
day into the fire from which it had emerged 14 billion years ago.
According to Einstein, that fate was determined by the large-scale
geometry of space time, which in turn is determined by the amount
of matter and energy in the universe.
</P>
<P>
Theorists had long favored the Euclidean, or "flat," geometry
that students learn in school -- a triangle between three distant
quasars would have internal angles that add up to 180 degrees -- but
astronomers could not find enough matter in the universe to make it
flat. Lange and his collaborators found that it was energy that was
making it flat.
</P>
<P>
Lange was co-leader, with Paolo de Bernardis of the University
of Rome, of an experiment called Boomerang, short for Balloon
Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics.
During a 10-day flight at 120,000 feet over Antarctica in 1998, the
gadget was able to detect and map faint ripples in the microwave
glow, which could be used like the ticks on a ruler to gauge the
cosmos and read off its geometry and other parameters.
</P>
<P>
The universe, they reported in 1999, is indeed flat. These
results not only suggested that it would expand forever; they also
provided crucial support for a bold theory that the universe had
undergone an explosive expansion, called inflation, when it was
only a fraction of a fraction of a second old.
</P>
<P>
Michael S. Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago,
said of Lange, "He and his Boomerang team got one of the biggest
prizes in cosmology: They were the first to show that the geometry
of the universe is flat."
</P>
<P>
Two similar experiments reported similar results at the same
time. Lange was part of one of them, the Maxima experiment, which
was led by his former professor Paul Richards of the University of
California, Berkeley. His former student Mark Devlin of the
University of Pennsylvania was co-leader of the other, known as the
Microwave Anisotropy Telescope. But astronomers believed that
Boomerang produced the most convincing data.
</P>
<P>
Marc Kamionkowski, a Caltech cosmologist, said, "Boomerang was
just crystal clear; it was the shot heard around the world."
</P>
<P>
The results were subsequently confirmed by the NASA's Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe, a satellite that has been mapping the
entire microwave sky since 2001.
</P>
<P>
These results also dovetailed with the strange discovery in 1998
that the expansion of the universe was speeding up, a discovery
that many astronomers and physicists had viewed with suspicion.
Most of the universe turned out to be not stars and galaxies or
even the mysterious as-yet-unidentified dark matter surrounding
them, but the so-called dark energy driving the acceleration of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
"So there are two very different lines of evidence indicating
that the universe is accelerating," Lange said in an interview
with the European Space Agency in 2001. "I believe it now."
</P>
<P>
Andrew E. Lange was born in Urbana, Ill., on July 23, 1957, the
oldest son of Joan Lange, a school librarian, and Albert Lange, an
architect, and grew up in Easton, Conn. He attended Princeton
University and then the University of California, Berkeley, where
he received a Ph.D. in 1987 and was promptly hired as a professor.
</P>
<P>
While he was at Berkeley as a Packard fellow, Lange met another
Packard fellow, Frances Arnold, a chemical engineer, who had
attended Princeton and Berkeley when he did, but whom he had never
met before then. The pair held a wedding ceremony for family and
friends in 1994, but never made it official with the state of
California, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
That same year Lange joined Caltech. By then the discovery of
the cosmic microwave background was transforming cosmology.
</P>
<P>
Lange, working with James Bock, now at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, built new detectors, known as spider web bolometers,
designed for studying the cosmic microwave work. The detectors were
used on both Maxima and Boomerang and a series of subsequent cosmic
experiments, including Planck, a satellite launched last year by
the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Lange was part of the Planck team but, always eager to be in the
forefront, was already working on ideas for new experiments.
</P>
<P>
"What will we discover with them?" Lange asked rhetorically in
his 2001 interview. "We don't know. The great thing here is that
you cannot predict what's going to come next. Five years ago no one
took the idea of the dark energy seriously!"
</P>
<P>
His friends and colleagues described Lange as a warm man who
always had a sparkle in his eye. "He was one of those guys who had
an aura of utter confidence and competency," Devlin said. But he
also struggled with depression.
</P>
<P>
"He cared immensely about other people and not enough about
himself," said Arnold, who is now a professor of chemical
engineering at Caltech. At the time of Lange's death, they were
separated.
</P>
<P>
Arnold survives him, along with three children: James Bailey,
her son from a previous relationship, whom Lange raised as his own;
William A. Lange; and Joseph I. Lange. He is also survived by his
parents and a sister, Karen Lange, of Washington, and a brother,
Adam Lange, of St. Louis.
