sentenceOffset/Text 6153: net&gt; wrote:  <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST=" &gt; In an &quot;editorial&quot; published in the Boston Herald, neocon propagandist-and &gt; jackleg historian-Jonah Goldberg gives us a running history lesson on &gt; &quot;al-Qaeda,&quot; specifically its purported ideological founder, Sheikh Abdullah &gt; Azzam. According to Goldberg, the late Azzam was &quot;one of the founders of the &gt; jihadist movement that became al-Qaeda.&quot; Indeed, this is true, although Mr. &gt; Goldberg, of course, does not bother to tell us the rest of the story, as &gt; Paul Harvey might have it.  &gt; Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam ran Maktab Khadamat al-Mujahidin al-Arab, the &gt; recruiting arm of the CIA-ISI operation against the Soviets in Afghanistan, &gt; responsible for organizing 35,000 Muslim radicals from 43 Islamic countries &gt; in the Middle East, North and East Africa, Central Asia and the Far East, as &gt; veteran Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid has noted. &quot;Even conventional &gt; sources regard Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK) as a CIA and ISI front organization. &gt; Moreover, MAK served as the offices of the World Muslim League and the &gt; Muslim Brotherhood in the northern Pakistan city of Peshawar,&quot; I wrote in &gt; January, 2006. As I have explained elsewhere, Azzam's connection to the &gt; Muslim Brotherhood is significant:  &gt;   Azzam's connection to the Muslim Brotherhood is a significant factor, &gt; considering the Muslim organization was long ago penetrated and made to jump &gt; through hoops for the sake of MI6 and later the CIA. &quot;According to CIA agent &gt; Miles Copeland, the Americans began looking for a Muslim Billy Graham around &gt; 1955,&quot; writes the Palestinian-born journalist and author Said K. Aburish. &gt; &quot;When finding or creating a Muslim Billy Graham proved elusive, the CIA &gt; began to cooperate with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim mass organization &gt; founded in Egypt but with followers throughout the Arab Middle East.&quot; In &gt; 1957, the CIA and MI6 collaborated to use the Muslim Brotherhood in an &gt; effort to destabilize Syria and assassinate its nationalist leaders (see &gt; Jean Shaoul, CIA-MI6 planned to assassinate Syrian leaders in 1957), a plan &gt; following the successful CIA-instigated overthrow of the popular and &gt; democratically elected Iranian leader Mohammed Mossadegh by a few years.  &gt; Azzam was simply one of a number of CIA-ISI operatives and patsies:  &gt;   As is often the case with useful but ultimately disposable Muslim &gt; fanatics, Sheikh Abdullah Azzam was assassinated on November 24, 1989 and &gt; Osama bin Laden took his place. Indeed. &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; may be considered an &gt; outgrowth of MAK-or more precisely, an heir apparent as engineered by the &gt; CIA, ISI, and Saudi intelligence. MAK had served its purpose as a recruiter &gt; and proselytizer of Wahhabi fanaticism in Afghanistan and after the Soviets &gt; were ejected the services of Azzam were no longer required (and he was &gt; likely considered a danger to the next phase-the spawning and unleashing of &gt; &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; in the Balkans and Chechnya).  &gt; &quot;MAK was a front for Pakistan's CIA, the Inter-Service Intelligence &gt; Directorate. The ISI was the first recipient of the vast bulk of CIA and &gt; Saudi Arabian covert assistance for the Afghan contras. Bin Laden was one of &gt; three people who ran MAK. In 1989, he took overall charge of MAK,&quot; writes &gt; Norm Dixon, an indisputable fact admitted by MSNBC in August, 1998, before &gt; everything changed, including history as recited by neocons. Hekmatyar, &gt; closely associated with bin Laden and Azzam, according to Asia Times, was &gt; &quot;an ISI stooge and creation&quot; (see above link).  &gt; Lisa Beyer, writing for Time Magazine as the pall of toxic fumes lingered &gt; over Ground Zero in New York, tells us: &quot;At the King Abdel Aziz University &gt; in Jidda, bin Laden, according to associates, was greatly influenced by one &gt; of his teachers, Abdullah Azzam, a Palestinian who was a major figure in the &gt; Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has played a large role in the resurgence &gt; of Islamic religiosity. Bin Laden, who like most Saudis is a member of the &gt; puritanical Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam, had been pious from childhood, but &gt; his encounter with Azzam seemed to deepen his faith. What's more, through &gt; Azzam he became steeped not in the then popular ideology of pan-Arabism, &gt; which stresses the unity of all Arabs, but in a more ambitious &gt; pan-Islamicism, which reaches out to all the world's 1 billion Muslims.&quot;  &gt; Beyer, of course, does not tell us that it was British intelligence and the &gt; CIA and their corrupt clients in the Middle East behind the rise of &gt; &quot;pan-Islamicism&quot; at the expense of Arab nationalism. &quot;The CIA was following &gt; the example of British Intelligence and sought to use Islam to further its &gt; goals,&quot; explains Peter Goodgame (The Globalists and the Islamists: Fomenting &gt; the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; for a New World Order). &quot;They wanted to find a &gt; charismatic religious leader that they could promote and control and they &gt; began to cooperate with groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. With the rise &gt; of Nasser the Brotherhood was also courted more seriously by the pro-Western &gt; Arab regimes of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. They needed all the popular support &gt; that they could muster against the rise of Nasser-inspired Arab nationalism &gt; to keep their regimes intact.&quot;  &gt; For Jonah Goldberg and the neocons, however, the instrumental beginnings of &gt; the Muslim Brotherhood, MAK, and &quot;al-Qaeda,&quot; a name gleaned from an Afghan &gt; mujahideen database, are not worthy of mention, as some people would get the &gt; idea that &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;-hardly a concern before the Brits, Americans, &gt; and Israelis took up interest for the sake of their own agendas-is something &gt; other than what the corporate media tells us it is. ">  So, if understand correctly, Sheikh Abdullah Azzam was &quot;one of the founders of the jihadist movement that became al-Qaeda.
