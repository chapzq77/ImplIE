sentenceOffset/Text 7902: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On Sept 11, 2001, World Trade Towers One, Two and Seven all collapsed via controlled demolition, according to Richard Gage of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.


sentenceOffset/Text 8117: Gage is the founding member of the group, and spoke about this theory at the Bloomington 9/11 Working Group's Monday night presentation in front of large crowd at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.


sentenceOffset/Text 8397: &quot;It is important to understand it because it was a pretext for the invasion of two countries in which almost a million people have perished,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 9419: Both Ryan and Gage argued that fires have never before or since Sept. 11 caused a high-rise building to collapse.


sentenceOffset/Text 9533: Gage said the fire is not consistent with the type of collapse of the Twin Towers and Building Seven.


sentenceOffset/Text 9636: Gage also spoke about reports that allegedly showed evidence of explosions, including eye-witness reports of typical signs of demolition.


sentenceOffset/Text 9774: Gage presented multiple videos of demolitions to demonstrate the key signs of the methods used, then showed how the same signs could be seen in the collapse of all three World Trade Towers.


sentenceOffset/Text 10153: Though Building Seven had been hit by some debris from the North Tower, only the seventh, 12th and 13th floors were burning, Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 11566: Neither Ryan or Gage cared to speculate as to who might have orchestrated a demolition of the towers, instead preferring to talk about the inconsistencies of the government reports.


sentenceOffset/Text 11749: &quot;Tonight we are concerned with science,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 11812: Still, Gage called on the audience members to contact their local legislators and demand a new, objective probe into what happened on Sept. 11.


sentenceOffset/Text 11957: &quot;Twenty-seven hundred people were murdered in what we can now safely call demolitions,&quot; Gage said.

sentenceOffset/Text 15266: Given that there are organizations of lawyers, engineers, pilots and 'scholars' for 911 truth I would expect a significant number of similar contributions and thus it should be possible for Gage et'al to conduct their own FEA analysis on the towers or WTC 7.

sentenceOffset/Text 20771: Almost 20% of all of AE911T's expenses were paying Gage.

sentenceOffset/Text 16017: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On Sept 11, 2001, World Trade Towers One, Two and Seven all collapsed via controlled demolition, according to Richard Gage of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.


sentenceOffset/Text 16232: Gage is the founding member of the group, and spoke about this theory at the Bloomington 9/11 Working Group's Monday night presentation in front of large crowd at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.


sentenceOffset/Text 16512: &quot;It is important to understand it because it was a pretext for the invasion of two countries in which almost a million people have perished,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 17534: Both Ryan and Gage argued that fires have never before or since Sept. 11 caused a high-rise building to collapse.


sentenceOffset/Text 17648: Gage said the fire is not consistent with the type of collapse of the Twin Towers and Building Seven.


sentenceOffset/Text 17751: Gage also spoke about reports that allegedly showed evidence of explosions, including eye-witness reports of typical signs of demolition.


sentenceOffset/Text 17889: Gage presented multiple videos of demolitions to demonstrate the key signs of the methods used, then showed how the same signs could be seen in the collapse of all three World Trade Towers.


sentenceOffset/Text 18268: Though Building Seven had been hit by some debris from the North Tower, only the seventh, 12th and 13th floors were burning, Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 19681: Neither Ryan or Gage cared to speculate as to who might have orchestrated a demolition of the towers, instead preferring to talk about the inconsistencies of the government reports.

sentenceOffset/Text 560: Prosecutors allege Graham was one of three AIM activists who kidnapped and killed Annie Mae Aquash because AIM leaders believed she was a government spy.

sentenceOffset/Text 3706: "To this day I don't know who shot Anna Mae Aquash," he said at the time.


sentenceOffset/Text 4018: Aquash's death came six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members on Pine Ridge, and two years after AIM's 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee, in which Aquash participated.


sentenceOffset/Text 4428: Theories about a cover-up abounded after the doctor who performed Aquash's first autopsy missed signs that she was murdered and concluded she died from exposure to the cold.


sentenceOffset/Text 4963: In testimony at Marshall's trial this year, Looking Cloud acknowledged standing nearby as Graham shot Aquash, then taking the gun from him and firing all the bullets in a different direction.


sentenceOffset/Text 5418: But the federal charges against Graham were repeatedly dismissed because prosecutors couldn't prove they had the authority to charge him, as Graham and Aquash are both from Canadian tribes.

sentenceOffset/Text 444: Lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini argued that Amanda Knox, together with her ex-boyfriend and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito and a third man convicted in a separate trial last year, killed Meredith Kercher under "the fumes of drugs and possibly alcohol."

prosecutor Giuliano Mignini	prosecutor	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 699: Knox and Sollecito tried to cover up their crime by staging a burglary, he contended.


sentenceOffset/Text 794: Knox, of Seattle, wanted to get back at Kercher for saying she was not clean and for calling her promiscuous, Mignini argued.

sentenceOffset/Text 929: "Amanda had the chance to retaliate against a girl who was serious and quiet," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1169: Knox, who has denied wrongdoing, appeared to be weeping as Mignini described the wounds on Kercher's body.


sentenceOffset/Text 1464: Mignini recalled previous testimony by Kercher's friends, in which the Briton reportedly expressed surprise and irritation at Knox's behavior.


sentenceOffset/Text 1607: Knox has denied having major problems with Kercher and has said in the past she was shocked at the death of a woman she considered a friend.


sentenceOffset/Text 1757: Knox and Sollecito are charged with murder and sexual violence in the 2007 killing in the central Italian town of Perugia.

Italian town of Perugia	italian	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 2080: Mignini contended that Knox, Sollecito and Guede met at the apartment where Kercher was killed on Nov. 1, 2007, shortly before the slaying, likely to settle some drug issues with Guede, who was known in Perugia for dealing drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 2310: According to the prosecutor, Kercher and Knox started arguing and then the three brutally attacked the Briton.


sentenceOffset/Text 2515: Occasionally raising his voice during his seven hour-long argument, Mignini described what he called "an unstoppable crescendo of frenzied violence," which began with Knox and Sollecito trying to take off Kercher's clothes and threatening her.


sentenceOffset/Text 2768: At one point, Knox hit Kercher's head against a wall, then tried to strangle her, as Sollecito held her and Guede sexually assaulted her, Mignini alleged.


sentenceOffset/Text 3065: Mignini said Knox used a knife to cut Kercher's throat, causing the deepest wound, while Sollecito used another knife to threaten her.


sentenceOffset/Text 3209: According to prosecutors, a knife with a 6 1/2-inch (16.5-centimeter) blade with Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's on the handle was found at Sollecito's house.


sentenceOffset/Text 3383: "That is the weapon with which Amanda inflicted the deadly blow," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 3860: Also on Friday, Mignini said that Knox and Sollecito staged a burglary in the apartment by breaking a window in a bedroom in an attempt to sidetrack the investigation.


sentenceOffset/Text 4534: Nothing in the room with the broken glass, which belonged to a roommate of Knox and Kercher, was reported missing, Mignini noted.


sentenceOffset/Text 4806: Knox's defense lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said Mignini's reconstruction was "suggestive," but it failed to present solid evidence.


sentenceOffset/Text 5181: The 22-year-old Knox maintains she spent the night of the murder at Sollecito's house in Perugia.


sentenceOffset/Text 5362: He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.


sentenceOffset/Text 5459: Defense lawyers for Knox and Sollecito are working on the theory that Guede was the sole attacker.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: Italian prosecutors: Knox hated murder victim </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PERUGIA, Italy 2009-11-20 15:56:05 UTC </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> An American student accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy had a growing hatred for the victim and killed her in retaliation during a drug-fueled sex game, a prosecutor said Friday in closing arguments at her murder trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 433: Lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini argued that Amanda Knox, together with her ex-boyfriend and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito and a third man convicted in a separate trial last year, killed Meredith Kercher under "the fumes of drugs and possibly alcohol" and then tried to cover up their crime by staging a burglary.

sentenceOffset/Text 758: Knox, of Seattle, wanted to get back at Kercher for saying she was not clean and for calling her promiscuous, Mignini said.

sentenceOffset/Text 891: "Amanda had the chance to retaliate against a girl who was serious and quiet," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1133: He said Knox, Sollecito and Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Hermann Guede met at the apartment where Kercher was killed on Nov. 1, 2007, shortly before the slaying, likely to settle some drug issues with Guede, who was known in Perugia for dealing drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 1381: He said Kercher and Knox started arguing and then the three brutally attacked the Briton.


sentenceOffset/Text 1564: Knox and Sollecito are charged with murder and sexual violence in the 2007 killing in the central Italian town of Perugia.

sentenceOffset/Text 1911: Mignini recalled previous testimony by Kercher's friends, in which the Briton expressed surprise and irritation at Knox's behavior.


sentenceOffset/Text 2043: Knox has denied having major problems with Kercher and has said in the past she was shocked at the death of a woman she considered a friend.


sentenceOffset/Text 2193: Mignini also said that Knox and Sollecito staged a burglary in the apartment by breaking a window in a bedroom in an attempt to sidetrack the investigation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3142: Knox and Sollecito have been jailed for more than two years and appeared tense as they sat in court Friday.


sentenceOffset/Text 3410: Knox and Sollecito could face Italy's stiffest punishment, life imprisonment, if convicted of murder.

sentenceOffset/Text 3698: According to prosecutors, the knife had Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's on the handle -- a claim defense lawyers reject, saying the knife is too big to match Kercher's wounds and the amount of what prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA is too low to be attributed with certainty.


sentenceOffset/Text 3988: The 22-year-old Knox maintains she spent the night of the murder at Sollecito's house in Perugia.


sentenceOffset/Text 4169: He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.

sentenceOffset/Text 1478: Dressed in a white shirt and tan slacks, her long brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, Knox said that she had been yelled at by police and hit on the head twice while she was being questioned.


sentenceOffset/Text 1888: In written testimony to police, Knox said she had been in the kitchen blocking her ears from Kercher's screams while Lumumba murdered her.

sentenceOffset/Text 2364: "The declarations were taken against my will and so everything I said was taken under confusion and pressure," Knox said of her letter.


sentenceOffset/Text 2509: On Friday, Knox said that she had been at \Sollecito's house the evening of the crime, where the two smoked marijuana, watched the French film "Amelie" and had sex.

sentenceOffset/Text 2784: \Knox also said that she had smoked marijuana "occasionally," including before testifying to police, which contributed to her confusion.


sentenceOffset/Text 2930: Driving much of the media attention are the conflicting portrayals of Knox, who is alternately described as a pot-smoking, sex-crazed girl gone wild, and a hard-working college student who saved her money to study in Perugia only to find herself in jail for more than a year and a half for a crime she says she never committed.


sentenceOffset/Text 3267: On Friday, Knox appeared confident, ebullient and in good humor throughout the day-long hearing.


sentenceOffset/Text 3668: In recent weeks, forensic investigators called by the prosecution have testified that they found DNA evidence of Knox's footprint in Kercher's blood in the apartment, and traces of Knox's and Kercher's intermingled blood in several places in the apartment.


sentenceOffset/Text 3934: While no clear murder weapon has been found, police did find an 8-inch kitchen knife at Sollecito's house bearing traces of Kercher's DNA near the tip and Knox's near the handle.


sentenceOffset/Text 4609: Knox was not under oath when she testified.

sentenceOffset/Text 880: Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, was sentenced to 25 years.


sentenceOffset/Text 1122: The release of the judges' document clears the way for the appeals expected from Knox and Sollecito.


sentenceOffset/Text 1232: After Kercher was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, the case became the focus of relentless media coverage.


sentenceOffset/Text 1390: Knox, in particular, became an object of fascination, alternately depicted as an innocent American caught up in the unpredictable Italian justice system and as a pot-smoking wild child capable of committing murder in the heat of a sex game.

sentenceOffset/Text 1961: They paint a picture of a debauched chain of events in which Guede, knowing that Knox and Sollecito were being "intimate" in Knox's room, "gave in to his own desires" and sought to have sex with Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 2174: Then, the judges wrote, Knox and Sollecito, who acknowledged smoking hashish that evening, "might have found it exciting" to help Guede sexually assault Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 2345: According to the judges, Knox and Sollecito "acted without premeditation" or "rancor" and also "showed a kind of compassion" by covering Kercher's body with a duvet.


sentenceOffset/Text 2520: Knox and Sollecito have denied involvement in the death, and maintain they were at Sollecito's house the night of the murder.


sentenceOffset/Text 2655: Although no definitive murder weapon was found, the trial in Perugia focused on a knife found at Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the tip.


sentenceOffset/Text 2826: In their reasoning, the judges said that that knife might not match the fatal slash on Kercher's neck, but that it was consistent with other of her wounds, indicating Knox's participation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3132: "This court maintains that that second assailant was Amanda Knox."


sentenceOffset/Text 3208: The judges also argued that DNA from Knox and Kercher appeared to have been mixed together in several spots of blood found in the bathroom they shared.


sentenceOffset/Text 3360: They added that the police found Knox's footprints in Kercher's blood in the house after police used luminol, a substance that reveals traces of blood left after cleaning.


sentenceOffset/Text 3606: In the reasoning, the judges also placed significant weight on evidence used to convict Knox and Sollecito of tampering with a crime scene to stage a robbery.


sentenceOffset/Text 3774: In a statement released by a family spokesman, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, said the reasoning contained "a lot of conjecture" as well as "discrepancies," "inconsistencies" and "contradictions" and "conclusions not supported by evidence."

sentenceOffset/Text 1859: Knox is quoted as mentioning Kercher's name only once -- to say on the day of the discovery of "Meredith's case" she was supposed to go on a trip to a nearby town with Sollecito.


sentenceOffset/Text 2047: Instead, the book focuses on Knox's personality, her childhood in Seattle, her hopes for post-prison life.


sentenceOffset/Text 2576: Knox says she would like to get married but "must also find the person," and would adopt children rather than giving birth because "there are a lot of kids in this world who have no one."


sentenceOffset/Text 3080: At another point, Knox says "being in here is like being in a limbo."


sentenceOffset/Text 3461: Girlanda, who heads a foundation that promotes ties between Italy and the United States, said he started meeting with Knox in a bid to help offset the diplomatic fallout the explosive case had created.


sentenceOffset/Text 3672: The lawmaker said he was curious to know the person behind the public persona, and never talked to Knox's parents, friends or lawyers.


sentenceOffset/Text 3816: "I wanted to know Amanda, I wasn't interested in Amanda Knox," Girlanda told the AP.


sentenceOffset/Text 4042: Knox was described by the prosecution as a manipulative, cold-blooded she-devil who had grown apart from Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 4156: Knox insisted she was friends with the victim and was shocked by her death.


sentenceOffset/Text 4241: The attorney for the Kercher family, Maresca, said he had not read the book but understood the author was trying to portray Knox as a profound, smart girl who as such could not possibly have been guilty.


sentenceOffset/Text 4810: Kercher's body was found in a pool of blood with her throat slit on Nov. 2, 2007, in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox while the two were exchange students in Perugia.

sentenceOffset/Text 5050: Prosecutors say on the night of the murder, Knox and Sollecito met at the apartment and Guede was also there.

sentenceOffset/Text 2025: By Alexandra Twin, CNNMoney.com senior writer August 16 2007: 11:06 AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Stocks tanked Thursday morning, extending the recent bloodletting, as investors took lender Countrywide Financial's latest woes as evidence of bigger problems for the credit and mortgage markets.

AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com)	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 3169: Credit worries were sustained Thursday after Countrywide Financial (down $3.12 to $18.17, Charts, Fortune 500), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said it was forced to tap an $11.5 billion line of credit to offset its liquidity crunch.

sentenceOffset/Text 11042: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 11297: Countrywide recently was funding about $40 billion a month in mortgages.


sentenceOffset/Text 11802: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.


sentenceOffset/Text 12391: Now, with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders, the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Anderson Center for Economic Research.

sentenceOffset/Text 1472: The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home-loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.

sentenceOffset/Text 4386: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 4641: Countrywide recently was funding about $40 billion a month in mortgages.


sentenceOffset/Text 5146: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.


sentenceOffset/Text 5735: Now, with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders, the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Anderson Center for Economic Research.

sentenceOffset/Text 2025: By Alexandra Twin, CNNMoney.com senior writer August 16 2007: 11:06 AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Stocks tanked Thursday morning, extending the recent bloodletting, as investors took lender Countrywide Financial's latest woes as evidence of bigger problems for the credit and mortgage markets.

AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com)	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 3169: Credit worries were sustained Thursday after Countrywide Financial (down $3.12 to $18.17, Charts, Fortune 500), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said it was forced to tap an $11.5 billion line of credit to offset its liquidity crunch.


sentenceOffset/Text 3406: Countrywide's increasing troubles over the last few days have exacerbated fears about a global credit crisis.


sentenceOffset/Text 7622: Countrywide Financial Corp., the biggest home-loan company in the nation, sought Thursday to assure depositors and the financial industry that both it and its bank were fiscally stable.


sentenceOffset/Text 8127: The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home-loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.

sentenceOffset/Text 10733: As for parent firm Countrywide Financial, the mortgage giant said draining its credit line would allow it to continue operations while refocusing its business on the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; mortgage loans that can be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.


sentenceOffset/Text 11042: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 11297: Countrywide recently was funding about $40 billion a month in mortgages.


sentenceOffset/Text 11802: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.


sentenceOffset/Text 12391: Now, with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders, the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Anderson Center for Economic Research.

sentenceOffset/Text 3642: A report in The New York Times cited unnamed former Countrywide employees saying the company used financial incentives to encourage employees to steer borrowers into subprime loans to boost profits.

sentenceOffset/Text 5972: Countrywide's expansion was also fueled by its move to sell conventional mortgage loans that were then resold to government- sponsored mortgage companies the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, or Freddie Mac.

sentenceOffset/Text 6718: Countrywide coped with that downturn by diversifying into more financial services, eventually opening its retail bank.


sentenceOffset/Text 6837: When interest rates began to plunge at the start of this decade, Countrywide joined the rest of the industry in rushing to feed an unprecedented demand on Wall Street for home loans.


sentenceOffset/Text 7115: While Countrywide was less exposed to subprime loans than the rest of the market, it had stepped up high-yield loan products such as pay option loans, which give borrowers the option to make a lower payment but can result in the unpaid portion being added to the principal balance.

sentenceOffset/Text 509: The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil fraud charges against two other former executives of Countrywide, saying they and Mozilo "deliberately" misled investors about the risky lending practices the company undertook in its aggressive drive for a share of the booming mortgage market.


sentenceOffset/Text 819: The SEC's civil lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles, named Mozilo, Countrywide's former chief operating officer David Sambol, 49, and ex-chief financial officer Eric Sieracki, 52.

sentenceOffset/Text 1702: A trail of e-mail messages sent by Mozilo in 2006, before the subprime mortgage market collapsed in 2007, underlined the SEC's allegations.


sentenceOffset/Text 1851: "In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic product," Mozilo told Sambol in an e-mail on April 17, 2006.


sentenceOffset/Text 2176: "There has to be major changes in this program," Mozilo wrote.


sentenceOffset/Text 3315: Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki "painted this mirage," Khuzami said.

sentenceOffset/Text 509: The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil fraud charges against two other former executives of Countrywide, saying they and Mozilo "deliberately" misled investors about the risky lending practices the company undertook in its aggressive drive for a share of the booming mortgage market.


sentenceOffset/Text 819: The SEC's civil lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles, named Mozilo, Countrywide's former chief operating officer David Sambol, 49, and ex-chief financial officer Eric Sieracki, 52.


sentenceOffset/Text 1463: Mozilo, 70, is the most high-profile individual to face formal charges from the federal government in the aftermath of the crisis.


sentenceOffset/Text 1702: A trail of e-mail messages sent by Mozilo in 2006, before the subprime mortgage market collapsed in 2007, underlined the SEC's allegations.

sentenceOffset/Text 3732: The agency also is seeking unspecified restitution of allegedly ill-gotten profits from Mozilo and Sambol.


sentenceOffset/Text 3848: Mozilo's attorney David Siegel said the stock sales "complied with applicable laws and regulations, and were made under the terms of a series of written sales plans which were reviewed and approved by responsible professionals."


sentenceOffset/Text 5081: The leveling of charges was a striking turn for Mozilo, the man who 40 years ago co-founded with David Loeb what grew into the largest U.S. mortgage lender.

sentenceOffset/Text 2862: Unlike Ebbers and Milken, Mozilo's settlement with the SEC is civil and he faces no jail time.


sentenceOffset/Text 3126: The SEC announced the charges against Mozilo in June 2009, and the settlement comes days before a trial was to begin in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 3259: Mozilo was accused of misleading shareholders and netting $140 million in personal profit from insider trading.


sentenceOffset/Text 3635: For Mozilo, it would have been an early evaluation of the evidence that could be used by prosecutors in a potential criminal trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 4111: The SEC charged that Mozilo and two other executives told Countrywide's shareholders that the firm wasn't partaking in the risky mortgage lending practices of competitors, when in fact it was radically reducing the standards it used to make loans.


docName: LTW_ENG_20090605.0127


sentenceOffset/Text 493: In a fraud and insider-trading lawsuit against Mozilo, the Securities and Exchange Commission quotes e-mails in which the executive derided certain Countrywide loan products as "toxic" and "poison" more than three years ago -- well before "toxic debt" entered the popular lexicon as the cause of the housing crash and the resulting global financial crisis and deep recession.


sentenceOffset/Text 878: "In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic product," Mozilo said in an April 2006 message, cited in the suit, about Countrywide's loans requiring no down payments from borrowers with abysmal credit.


sentenceOffset/Text 1173: But Mozilo never advised shareholders just how lax the nation's No.1 mortgage lender's standards had become, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 1873: Lawyers for Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki vehemently denied wrongdoing by their clients, suggested the e-mails were taken out of context and called the suit a political response to outrage over the government's failure to prevent the mortgage meltdown that began in late 2007 and the economic pain that has followed.


sentenceOffset/Text 2197: "The lawsuit filed today by the SEC does not reflect a balanced or fair consideration of the facts or the law," David Siegel, a lawyer for Mozilo, said, denying that the executive "knew about some undisclosed risk."

David Siegel, a lawyer	lawyer	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 3857: Mozilo and the others "painted a mirage for investors," SEC enforcement chief Khuzami said.


sentenceOffset/Text 4335: The insider trading allegations against Mozilo focus on his repeated creation of preset stock-selling plans in 2006 -- plus a change to one of them in early 2007 -- "while he was aware of the company's increasing credit risk and the expected poor performance of Countrywide-originated loans."


sentenceOffset/Text 4637: The plans allowed Mozilo to sell more Countrywide shares than initially planned, exercising 5.1 million options at a profit of nearly $140 million, the suit says.

sentenceOffset/Text 2649: If your ADF receiver in the aircraft has a movable bearing indicator card (the round ring with magnetic bearings printed on it that is around the outside edge of the dial) then you can turn this ring with a knob until the magnetic heading that you are currently flying is aligned with a mark that is at the very top of the dial.


sentenceOffset/Text 2978: When the ADF bearing card is aligned in this way, then the ADF needle will point to the bearing that you should fly to take you to the ADF station.


sentenceOffset/Text 3126: The advantages of ADF navigation is that since the ADF signal is a relatively low frequency (I think it somewhere in the AM/FM band) it is not subject to line-of-sight limitations like VHF VOR transmitters are.


sentenceOffset/Text 3337: An ADF station can be below the horizon or out of line of sight and still be received.


sentenceOffset/Text 3424: ADF signals are easier to pick up at low altitudes, or even sitting on the ground.


sentenceOffset/Text 3507: The downside to ADF signals is that they are  affected by lightning and rain.


sentenceOffset/Text 3585: In a lightning storm the ADF needle may point to lightning rather than the ADF station.


sentenceOffset/Text 3673: Some ADF aircraft receivers will even pick up regular AM/FM broadcasts, and allow you to home in on their signals too.


sentenceOffset/Text 3792: But the over-all range of an ADF signal is not as great as a VHF signal (all things being equal).


sentenceOffset/Text 4249: The way a VOR station/receiver works is a little more involved than a simple ADF signal.


sentenceOffset/Text 5542: So to make a long story even longer... ADF navigation is an older technology.


sentenceOffset/Text 7456: The ADF, the &quot;Automatic Direction Finder&quot; is the receiver equipment in the aircraft that locates the position of the beacon.
