sentenceOffset/Text 2025: By Alexandra Twin, CNNMoney.com senior writer August 16 2007: 11:06 AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Stocks tanked Thursday morning, extending the recent bloodletting, as investors took lender Countrywide Financial's latest woes as evidence of bigger problems for the credit and mortgage markets.

AM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com)	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 3169: Credit worries were sustained Thursday after Countrywide Financial (down $3.12 to $18.17, Charts, Fortune 500), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said it was forced to tap an $11.5 billion line of credit to offset its liquidity crunch.


sentenceOffset/Text 3406: Countrywide's increasing troubles over the last few days have exacerbated fears about a global credit crisis.


sentenceOffset/Text 7622: Countrywide Financial Corp., the biggest home-loan company in the nation, sought Thursday to assure depositors and the financial industry that both it and its bank were fiscally stable.


sentenceOffset/Text 8127: The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home-loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.

sentenceOffset/Text 10733: As for parent firm Countrywide Financial, the mortgage giant said draining its credit line would allow it to continue operations while refocusing its business on the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; mortgage loans that can be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.


sentenceOffset/Text 11042: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 11297: Countrywide recently was funding about $40 billion a month in mortgages.


sentenceOffset/Text 11802: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.


sentenceOffset/Text 12391: Now, with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders, the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Anderson Center for Economic Research.

sentenceOffset/Text 967: Countrywide Financial Corp., the biggest home-loan company in the nation, sought Thursday to assure depositors and the financial industry that both it and its bank were fiscally stable.


sentenceOffset/Text 1472: The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home-loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.

sentenceOffset/Text 4077: As for parent firm Countrywide Financial, the mortgage giant said draining its credit line would allow it to continue operations while refocusing its business on the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; mortgage loans that can be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.


sentenceOffset/Text 4386: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 4641: Countrywide recently was funding about $40 billion a month in mortgages.


sentenceOffset/Text 5146: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.


sentenceOffset/Text 5735: Now, with a pullback in larger loans by Countrywide and other major lenders, the weakness at the low end is likely to spread upward, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University's Anderson Center for Economic Research.

sentenceOffset/Text 11042: Countrywide said it planned to fund more mortgages through Countrywide Bank and have the bank invest in certain loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't buy, such as &quot;jumbo&quot; mortgages, which in California are defined as those over $417,000.

sentenceOffset/Text 11802: Mortgage industry executives, however, said that although Countrywide Bank was the nation's third-largest savings and loan, after Washington Mutual and Wachovia Bank's World Savings unit, it was far too small to absorb the entire $20 billion a month in nonconforming loans Countrywide Financial produced.

sentenceOffset/Text 2438: Countrywide dominated the industry when interest rates began to plummet at the start of the decade and competitors rushed to make subprime loans.

sentenceOffset/Text 3345: The resulting credit crunch that tore through the markets has left Countrywide and others holding loans they couldn't sell and hurting for cash to keep funding new ones.


sentenceOffset/Text 3642: A report in The New York Times cited unnamed former Countrywide employees saying the company used financial incentives to encourage employees to steer borrowers into subprime loans to boost profits.

sentenceOffset/Text 4626: During a conference call with Wall Street analysts in January, Countrywide Chairman and Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo said the company expected rising delinquencies and a weak housing market but was &quot;well positioned and extremely optimistic about our prospects to continue generating growth and superior returns over future cycles.&quot;

sentenceOffset/Text 5972: Countrywide's expansion was also fueled by its move to sell conventional mortgage loans that were then resold to government- sponsored mortgage companies the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, or Freddie Mac.


sentenceOffset/Text 6252: The strategy helped Countrywide weather the crash of the high-flying housing market at the end of the 1980s.


sentenceOffset/Text 6718: Countrywide coped with that downturn by diversifying into more financial services, eventually opening its retail bank.


sentenceOffset/Text 6837: When interest rates began to plunge at the start of this decade, Countrywide joined the rest of the industry in rushing to feed an unprecedented demand on Wall Street for home loans.


sentenceOffset/Text 7115: While Countrywide was less exposed to subprime loans than the rest of the market, it had stepped up high-yield loan products such as pay option loans, which give borrowers the option to make a lower payment but can result in the unpaid portion being added to the principal balance.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: SEC charging ex-Countrywide CEO Mozilo with fraud </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON 2009-06-05 00:34:36 UTC </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> Federal regulators on Thursday charged Angelo Mozilo, the former chief executive of fallen mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp., with civil fraud and illegal insider trading in a prominent case arising from the financial meltdown.


sentenceOffset/Text 436: The Securities and Exchange Commission also accused two other former executives of Countrywide of civil fraud, saying they and Mozilo "deliberately" misled investors about the risks the company assumed in its aggressive drive for a share of the booming mortgage market.


sentenceOffset/Text 715: The SEC's civil lawsuit was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, naming Mozilo, Countrywide's former chief operating officer David Sambol, 49, and ex-chief financial officer Eric Sieracki, 52.


sentenceOffset/Text 919: A trail of e-mail messages sent by Mozilo in 2006, before the subprime mortgage market collapsed in 2007, underlined the SEC's allegations.


sentenceOffset/Text 1848: Mozilo, 70, is the most high-profile individual to face formal charges from the federal government in the aftermath of the crisis.


sentenceOffset/Text 2564: Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki "painted this mirage," Khuzami said.


sentenceOffset/Text 2638: In addition, Mozilo "was actively taking his own chips off the table" by selling his shares to reap nearly $140 million in illicit profits, he said.


sentenceOffset/Text 2796: The SEC is seeking injunctions and unspecified civil fines against Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki and wants them to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company.


sentenceOffset/Text 2989: The agency also is seeking unspecified restitution of allegedly ill-gotten profits from Mozilo and Sambol.


sentenceOffset/Text 3105: Mozilo's attorney David Siegel said the stock sales "complied with applicable laws and regulations, and were made under the terms of a series of written sales plans which were reviewed and approved by responsible professionals."


sentenceOffset/Text 3496: The leveling of charges was a striking turn for Mozilo, the man who 40 years ago co-founded what grew into the nation's largest mortgage lender.


sentenceOffset/Text 4152: "Under Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide became the poster child for unconscionable behavior by mortgage lenders," Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday.

sentenceOffset/Text 1793: Mozilo is paying about $23 million out of his own pocket as a penalty.

sentenceOffset/Text 2862: Unlike Ebbers and Milken, Mozilo's settlement with the SEC is civil and he faces no jail time.


sentenceOffset/Text 3126: The SEC announced the charges against Mozilo in June 2009, and the settlement comes days before a trial was to begin in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 3259: Mozilo was accused of misleading shareholders and netting $140 million in personal profit from insider trading.


sentenceOffset/Text 3635: For Mozilo, it would have been an early evaluation of the evidence that could be used by prosecutors in a potential criminal trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 4111: The SEC charged that Mozilo and two other executives told Countrywide's shareholders that the firm wasn't partaking in the risky mortgage lending practices of competitors, when in fact it was radically reducing the standards it used to make loans.


docName: LTW_ENG_20090605.0127


sentenceOffset/Text 493: In a fraud and insider-trading lawsuit against Mozilo, the Securities and Exchange Commission quotes e-mails in which the executive derided certain Countrywide loan products as "toxic" and "poison" more than three years ago -- well before "toxic debt" entered the popular lexicon as the cause of the housing crash and the resulting global financial crisis and deep recession.


sentenceOffset/Text 878: "In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic product," Mozilo said in an April 2006 message, cited in the suit, about Countrywide's loans requiring no down payments from borrowers with abysmal credit.


sentenceOffset/Text 1173: But Mozilo never advised shareholders just how lax the nation's No.1 mortgage lender's standards had become, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 1873: Lawyers for Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki vehemently denied wrongdoing by their clients, suggested the e-mails were taken out of context and called the suit a political response to outrage over the government's failure to prevent the mortgage meltdown that began in late 2007 and the economic pain that has followed.


sentenceOffset/Text 2197: "The lawsuit filed today by the SEC does not reflect a balanced or fair consideration of the facts or the law," David Siegel, a lawyer for Mozilo, said, denying that the executive "knew about some undisclosed risk."

David Siegel, a lawyer	lawyer	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 3857: Mozilo and the others "painted a mirage for investors," SEC enforcement chief Khuzami said.


sentenceOffset/Text 4335: The insider trading allegations against Mozilo focus on his repeated creation of preset stock-selling plans in 2006 -- plus a change to one of them in early 2007 -- "while he was aware of the company's increasing credit risk and the expected poor performance of Countrywide-originated loans."


sentenceOffset/Text 4637: The plans allowed Mozilo to sell more Countrywide shares than initially planned, exercising 5.1 million options at a profit of nearly $140 million, the suit says.


sentenceOffset/Text 5314: Federal officials have told the Los Angeles Times that Countrywide and Mozilo are the targets of a criminal investigation by the FBI and a grand jury in Los Angeles.

U.K.) </POST> <POST> <POSTER> "RandyL	u.k.	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 2249: ADF stands for &quot;Automatic Direction Finding&quot;.


sentenceOffset/Text 2435: The ADF receiver in the cockpit gives the pilot an indication of the relative bearing to the source of the ADF broadcast station.


sentenceOffset/Text 2565: The ADF needle will &quot;point&quot; in the relative direction of the ADF station.


sentenceOffset/Text 2649: If your ADF receiver in the aircraft has a movable bearing indicator card (the round ring with magnetic bearings printed on it that is around the outside edge of the dial) then you can turn this ring with a knob until the magnetic heading that you are currently flying is aligned with a mark that is at the very top of the dial.


sentenceOffset/Text 2978: When the ADF bearing card is aligned in this way, then the ADF needle will point to the bearing that you should fly to take you to the ADF station.


sentenceOffset/Text 3126: The advantages of ADF navigation is that since the ADF signal is a relatively low frequency (I think it somewhere in the AM/FM band) it is not subject to line-of-sight limitations like VHF VOR transmitters are.


sentenceOffset/Text 3337: An ADF station can be below the horizon or out of line of sight and still be received.


sentenceOffset/Text 3424: ADF signals are easier to pick up at low altitudes, or even sitting on the ground.


sentenceOffset/Text 3507: The downside to ADF signals is that they are  affected by lightning and rain.


sentenceOffset/Text 3585: In a lightning storm the ADF needle may point to lightning rather than the ADF station.


sentenceOffset/Text 3673: Some ADF aircraft receivers will even pick up regular AM/FM broadcasts, and allow you to home in on their signals too.


sentenceOffset/Text 3792: But the over-all range of an ADF signal is not as great as a VHF signal (all things being equal).


sentenceOffset/Text 4249: The way a VOR station/receiver works is a little more involved than a simple ADF signal.


sentenceOffset/Text 5542: So to make a long story even longer... ADF navigation is an older technology.


sentenceOffset/Text 7456: The ADF, the &quot;Automatic Direction Finder&quot; is the receiver equipment in the aircraft that locates the position of the beacon.
