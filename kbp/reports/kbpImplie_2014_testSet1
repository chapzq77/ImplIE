sentenceOffset/Text 7902: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On Sept 11, 2001, World Trade Towers One, Two and Seven all collapsed via controlled demolition, according to Richard Gage of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.


sentenceOffset/Text 8117: Gage is the founding member of the group, and spoke about this theory at the Bloomington 9/11 Working Group's Monday night presentation in front of large crowd at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.


sentenceOffset/Text 8397: &quot;It is important to understand it because it was a pretext for the invasion of two countries in which almost a million people have perished,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 9419: Both Ryan and Gage argued that fires have never before or since Sept. 11 caused a high-rise building to collapse.


sentenceOffset/Text 9533: Gage said the fire is not consistent with the type of collapse of the Twin Towers and Building Seven.


sentenceOffset/Text 9636: Gage also spoke about reports that allegedly showed evidence of explosions, including eye-witness reports of typical signs of demolition.


sentenceOffset/Text 9774: Gage presented multiple videos of demolitions to demonstrate the key signs of the methods used, then showed how the same signs could be seen in the collapse of all three World Trade Towers.


sentenceOffset/Text 10153: Though Building Seven had been hit by some debris from the North Tower, only the seventh, 12th and 13th floors were burning, Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 11566: Neither Ryan or Gage cared to speculate as to who might have orchestrated a demolition of the towers, instead preferring to talk about the inconsistencies of the government reports.


sentenceOffset/Text 11749: &quot;Tonight we are concerned with science,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 11812: Still, Gage called on the audience members to contact their local legislators and demand a new, objective probe into what happened on Sept. 11.


sentenceOffset/Text 11957: &quot;Twenty-seven hundred people were murdered in what we can now safely call demolitions,&quot; Gage said.

sentenceOffset/Text 15266: Given that there are organizations of lawyers, engineers, pilots and 'scholars' for 911 truth I would expect a significant number of similar contributions and thus it should be possible for Gage et'al to conduct their own FEA analysis on the towers or WTC 7.

sentenceOffset/Text 20771: Almost 20% of all of AE911T's expenses were paying Gage.

sentenceOffset/Text 16017: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  On Sept 11, 2001, World Trade Towers One, Two and Seven all collapsed via controlled demolition, according to Richard Gage of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth.


sentenceOffset/Text 16232: Gage is the founding member of the group, and spoke about this theory at the Bloomington 9/11 Working Group's Monday night presentation in front of large crowd at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.


sentenceOffset/Text 16512: &quot;It is important to understand it because it was a pretext for the invasion of two countries in which almost a million people have perished,&quot; Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 17534: Both Ryan and Gage argued that fires have never before or since Sept. 11 caused a high-rise building to collapse.


sentenceOffset/Text 17648: Gage said the fire is not consistent with the type of collapse of the Twin Towers and Building Seven.


sentenceOffset/Text 17751: Gage also spoke about reports that allegedly showed evidence of explosions, including eye-witness reports of typical signs of demolition.


sentenceOffset/Text 17889: Gage presented multiple videos of demolitions to demonstrate the key signs of the methods used, then showed how the same signs could be seen in the collapse of all three World Trade Towers.


sentenceOffset/Text 18268: Though Building Seven had been hit by some debris from the North Tower, only the seventh, 12th and 13th floors were burning, Gage said.


sentenceOffset/Text 19681: Neither Ryan or Gage cared to speculate as to who might have orchestrated a demolition of the towers, instead preferring to talk about the inconsistencies of the government reports.

sentenceOffset/Text 560: Prosecutors allege Graham was one of three AIM activists who kidnapped and killed Annie Mae Aquash because AIM leaders believed she was a government spy.

sentenceOffset/Text 3706: "To this day I don't know who shot Anna Mae Aquash," he said at the time.


sentenceOffset/Text 4018: Aquash's death came six months after two FBI agents were gunned down in a shootout with AIM members on Pine Ridge, and two years after AIM's 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee, in which Aquash participated.


sentenceOffset/Text 4428: Theories about a cover-up abounded after the doctor who performed Aquash's first autopsy missed signs that she was murdered and concluded she died from exposure to the cold.


sentenceOffset/Text 4963: In testimony at Marshall's trial this year, Looking Cloud acknowledged standing nearby as Graham shot Aquash, then taking the gun from him and firing all the bullets in a different direction.


sentenceOffset/Text 5418: But the federal charges against Graham were repeatedly dismissed because prosecutors couldn't prove they had the authority to charge him, as Graham and Aquash are both from Canadian tribes.

sentenceOffset/Text 444: Lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini argued that Amanda Knox, together with her ex-boyfriend and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito and a third man convicted in a separate trial last year, killed Meredith Kercher under "the fumes of drugs and possibly alcohol."

prosecutor Giuliano Mignini	prosecutor	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 699: Knox and Sollecito tried to cover up their crime by staging a burglary, he contended.


sentenceOffset/Text 794: Knox, of Seattle, wanted to get back at Kercher for saying she was not clean and for calling her promiscuous, Mignini argued.

sentenceOffset/Text 929: "Amanda had the chance to retaliate against a girl who was serious and quiet," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1169: Knox, who has denied wrongdoing, appeared to be weeping as Mignini described the wounds on Kercher's body.


sentenceOffset/Text 1464: Mignini recalled previous testimony by Kercher's friends, in which the Briton reportedly expressed surprise and irritation at Knox's behavior.


sentenceOffset/Text 1607: Knox has denied having major problems with Kercher and has said in the past she was shocked at the death of a woman she considered a friend.


sentenceOffset/Text 1757: Knox and Sollecito are charged with murder and sexual violence in the 2007 killing in the central Italian town of Perugia.

Italian town of Perugia	italian	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 2080: Mignini contended that Knox, Sollecito and Guede met at the apartment where Kercher was killed on Nov. 1, 2007, shortly before the slaying, likely to settle some drug issues with Guede, who was known in Perugia for dealing drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 2310: According to the prosecutor, Kercher and Knox started arguing and then the three brutally attacked the Briton.


sentenceOffset/Text 2515: Occasionally raising his voice during his seven hour-long argument, Mignini described what he called "an unstoppable crescendo of frenzied violence," which began with Knox and Sollecito trying to take off Kercher's clothes and threatening her.


sentenceOffset/Text 2768: At one point, Knox hit Kercher's head against a wall, then tried to strangle her, as Sollecito held her and Guede sexually assaulted her, Mignini alleged.


sentenceOffset/Text 3065: Mignini said Knox used a knife to cut Kercher's throat, causing the deepest wound, while Sollecito used another knife to threaten her.


sentenceOffset/Text 3209: According to prosecutors, a knife with a 6 1/2-inch (16.5-centimeter) blade with Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's on the handle was found at Sollecito's house.


sentenceOffset/Text 3383: "That is the weapon with which Amanda inflicted the deadly blow," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 3860: Also on Friday, Mignini said that Knox and Sollecito staged a burglary in the apartment by breaking a window in a bedroom in an attempt to sidetrack the investigation.


sentenceOffset/Text 4534: Nothing in the room with the broken glass, which belonged to a roommate of Knox and Kercher, was reported missing, Mignini noted.


sentenceOffset/Text 4806: Knox's defense lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said Mignini's reconstruction was "suggestive," but it failed to present solid evidence.


sentenceOffset/Text 5181: The 22-year-old Knox maintains she spent the night of the murder at Sollecito's house in Perugia.


sentenceOffset/Text 5362: He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.


sentenceOffset/Text 5459: Defense lawyers for Knox and Sollecito are working on the theory that Guede was the sole attacker.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: Italian prosecutors: Knox hated murder victim </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PERUGIA, Italy 2009-11-20 15:56:05 UTC </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> An American student accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy had a growing hatred for the victim and killed her in retaliation during a drug-fueled sex game, a prosecutor said Friday in closing arguments at her murder trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 433: Lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini argued that Amanda Knox, together with her ex-boyfriend and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito and a third man convicted in a separate trial last year, killed Meredith Kercher under "the fumes of drugs and possibly alcohol" and then tried to cover up their crime by staging a burglary.

sentenceOffset/Text 758: Knox, of Seattle, wanted to get back at Kercher for saying she was not clean and for calling her promiscuous, Mignini said.

sentenceOffset/Text 891: "Amanda had the chance to retaliate against a girl who was serious and quiet," Mignini said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1133: He said Knox, Sollecito and Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Hermann Guede met at the apartment where Kercher was killed on Nov. 1, 2007, shortly before the slaying, likely to settle some drug issues with Guede, who was known in Perugia for dealing drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 1381: He said Kercher and Knox started arguing and then the three brutally attacked the Briton.


sentenceOffset/Text 1564: Knox and Sollecito are charged with murder and sexual violence in the 2007 killing in the central Italian town of Perugia.

sentenceOffset/Text 1911: Mignini recalled previous testimony by Kercher's friends, in which the Briton expressed surprise and irritation at Knox's behavior.


sentenceOffset/Text 2043: Knox has denied having major problems with Kercher and has said in the past she was shocked at the death of a woman she considered a friend.


sentenceOffset/Text 2193: Mignini also said that Knox and Sollecito staged a burglary in the apartment by breaking a window in a bedroom in an attempt to sidetrack the investigation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3142: Knox and Sollecito have been jailed for more than two years and appeared tense as they sat in court Friday.


sentenceOffset/Text 3410: Knox and Sollecito could face Italy's stiffest punishment, life imprisonment, if convicted of murder.

sentenceOffset/Text 3698: According to prosecutors, the knife had Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's on the handle -- a claim defense lawyers reject, saying the knife is too big to match Kercher's wounds and the amount of what prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA is too low to be attributed with certainty.


sentenceOffset/Text 3988: The 22-year-old Knox maintains she spent the night of the murder at Sollecito's house in Perugia.


sentenceOffset/Text 4169: He said he does not remember if Knox spent the whole night with him or just part of it.

sentenceOffset/Text 1478: Dressed in a white shirt and tan slacks, her long brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, Knox said that she had been yelled at by police and hit on the head twice while she was being questioned.


sentenceOffset/Text 1888: In written testimony to police, Knox said she had been in the kitchen blocking her ears from Kercher's screams while Lumumba murdered her.

sentenceOffset/Text 2364: "The declarations were taken against my will and so everything I said was taken under confusion and pressure," Knox said of her letter.


sentenceOffset/Text 2509: On Friday, Knox said that she had been at \Sollecito's house the evening of the crime, where the two smoked marijuana, watched the French film "Amelie" and had sex.

sentenceOffset/Text 2784: \Knox also said that she had smoked marijuana "occasionally," including before testifying to police, which contributed to her confusion.


sentenceOffset/Text 2930: Driving much of the media attention are the conflicting portrayals of Knox, who is alternately described as a pot-smoking, sex-crazed girl gone wild, and a hard-working college student who saved her money to study in Perugia only to find herself in jail for more than a year and a half for a crime she says she never committed.


sentenceOffset/Text 3267: On Friday, Knox appeared confident, ebullient and in good humor throughout the day-long hearing.


sentenceOffset/Text 3668: In recent weeks, forensic investigators called by the prosecution have testified that they found DNA evidence of Knox's footprint in Kercher's blood in the apartment, and traces of Knox's and Kercher's intermingled blood in several places in the apartment.


sentenceOffset/Text 3934: While no clear murder weapon has been found, police did find an 8-inch kitchen knife at Sollecito's house bearing traces of Kercher's DNA near the tip and Knox's near the handle.


sentenceOffset/Text 4609: Knox was not under oath when she testified.

sentenceOffset/Text 880: Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, was sentenced to 25 years.


sentenceOffset/Text 1122: The release of the judges' document clears the way for the appeals expected from Knox and Sollecito.


sentenceOffset/Text 1232: After Kercher was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, the case became the focus of relentless media coverage.


sentenceOffset/Text 1390: Knox, in particular, became an object of fascination, alternately depicted as an innocent American caught up in the unpredictable Italian justice system and as a pot-smoking wild child capable of committing murder in the heat of a sex game.

sentenceOffset/Text 1961: They paint a picture of a debauched chain of events in which Guede, knowing that Knox and Sollecito were being "intimate" in Knox's room, "gave in to his own desires" and sought to have sex with Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 2174: Then, the judges wrote, Knox and Sollecito, who acknowledged smoking hashish that evening, "might have found it exciting" to help Guede sexually assault Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 2345: According to the judges, Knox and Sollecito "acted without premeditation" or "rancor" and also "showed a kind of compassion" by covering Kercher's body with a duvet.


sentenceOffset/Text 2520: Knox and Sollecito have denied involvement in the death, and maintain they were at Sollecito's house the night of the murder.


sentenceOffset/Text 2655: Although no definitive murder weapon was found, the trial in Perugia focused on a knife found at Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the tip.


sentenceOffset/Text 2826: In their reasoning, the judges said that that knife might not match the fatal slash on Kercher's neck, but that it was consistent with other of her wounds, indicating Knox's participation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3132: "This court maintains that that second assailant was Amanda Knox."


sentenceOffset/Text 3208: The judges also argued that DNA from Knox and Kercher appeared to have been mixed together in several spots of blood found in the bathroom they shared.


sentenceOffset/Text 3360: They added that the police found Knox's footprints in Kercher's blood in the house after police used luminol, a substance that reveals traces of blood left after cleaning.


sentenceOffset/Text 3606: In the reasoning, the judges also placed significant weight on evidence used to convict Knox and Sollecito of tampering with a crime scene to stage a robbery.


sentenceOffset/Text 3774: In a statement released by a family spokesman, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, said the reasoning contained "a lot of conjecture" as well as "discrepancies," "inconsistencies" and "contradictions" and "conclusions not supported by evidence."

sentenceOffset/Text 1859: Knox is quoted as mentioning Kercher's name only once -- to say on the day of the discovery of "Meredith's case" she was supposed to go on a trip to a nearby town with Sollecito.


sentenceOffset/Text 2047: Instead, the book focuses on Knox's personality, her childhood in Seattle, her hopes for post-prison life.


sentenceOffset/Text 2576: Knox says she would like to get married but "must also find the person," and would adopt children rather than giving birth because "there are a lot of kids in this world who have no one."


sentenceOffset/Text 3080: At another point, Knox says "being in here is like being in a limbo."


sentenceOffset/Text 3461: Girlanda, who heads a foundation that promotes ties between Italy and the United States, said he started meeting with Knox in a bid to help offset the diplomatic fallout the explosive case had created.


sentenceOffset/Text 3672: The lawmaker said he was curious to know the person behind the public persona, and never talked to Knox's parents, friends or lawyers.


sentenceOffset/Text 3816: "I wanted to know Amanda, I wasn't interested in Amanda Knox," Girlanda told the AP.


sentenceOffset/Text 4042: Knox was described by the prosecution as a manipulative, cold-blooded she-devil who had grown apart from Kercher.


sentenceOffset/Text 4156: Knox insisted she was friends with the victim and was shocked by her death.


sentenceOffset/Text 4241: The attorney for the Kercher family, Maresca, said he had not read the book but understood the author was trying to portray Knox as a profound, smart girl who as such could not possibly have been guilty.


sentenceOffset/Text 4810: Kercher's body was found in a pool of blood with her throat slit on Nov. 2, 2007, in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox while the two were exchange students in Perugia.

sentenceOffset/Text 5050: Prosecutors say on the night of the murder, Knox and Sollecito met at the apartment and Guede was also there.
