sentenceOffset/Text 1024: Prosecutors would not comment on the substance of the case in which Middelhoff is being investigated for possible "breach of trust," a criminal charge in Germany.


sentenceOffset/Text 1381: On the issue of Middelhoff's expenses, the bankruptcy trustee has up to three years to sue former executives on behalf of creditors.


sentenceOffset/Text 1514: Bankruptcy lawyers say that the number of civil lawsuits brought by trustees has multiplied because insolvent companies, particularly those in the services sector, like Arcandor, tend to have fewer assets that can be sold to pay creditors.


sentenceOffset/Text 1873: The real estate dealings were first disclosed by Middelhoff five years ago when he joined Arcandor.

sentenceOffset/Text 3315: He became chairman of Arcandor in 2004 and switched to chief executive in 2005.


sentenceOffset/Text 3395: (He left in March, shortly before Arcandor declared bankruptcy.)


sentenceOffset/Text 3469: The appointment of Middelhoff was viewed as a last bid to rescue the company since the company's business has been in decline for years.


sentenceOffset/Text 3606: But it created a conflict of interest, which Middelhoff disclosed before joining the board.


sentenceOffset/Text 3698: Arcandor would naturally want the lowest possible rents for Karstadt, but an investor in Esch's funds would want to wring more out of tenants.
