4419	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	The panel met to explore ways of "defeating the enemy militarily, politically and through the media," with the enemy being the Tutsis.
4424	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	There is a "lack of will by the tribunal ... which did not accomplish its task to the end," said Guichaoua.
4425	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"To me Bagosora was delegated to, he was not in control," Guichaoua explained.
4426	AFP_ENG_20081219.0160.LDC2009T13	"This means that the ICTR does not want to go up to the top ... but not wanting to know who assassinated Juvenal Habyarimana or pursue the crimes of senior RPF leaders, the court is thus morally handicapped," he added.

4433	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	"Every coalition party has sent their list of ministers, and the cabinet secretary has forwarded the list to the palace," Abhisit said Friday.
4435	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	I have told ministers of that concern, so they must quickly work to create confidence and select acceptable working teams."
4440	AFP_ENG_20081220.0276.LDC2009T13	Abhisit has said he wants to bring peace and stability back to the kingdom after the protests and has tried to reach out to Thaksin's supporters, but some of his reported choices for cabinet posts have cast doubt on those promises.

5453	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	An announcement is expected Monday, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the deal had not been made public.
5454	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Specifics of the arrangement were not disclosed.
5457	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The deal marks a major design win for Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, which has been fighting to reverse plunging profits and regain market share lost to archrival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
5458	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	It is also a sizable victory for Sun as the company continues its long climb back to profitability following the dot-com collapse and seeks more mainstream adoption of its servers and software products.
5461	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The partnership comes amid an intensifying fight for market share between Intel and AMD.
5463	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	They have also been waging an inch-by-inch battle for market share that has been particularly painful for Intel, whose previous generations of chips began falling out of favor for their high energy consumption.
5465	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Longtime Intel loyalist Dell Inc. said it would also begin using AMD chips in its PCs and servers.
5466	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Some of AMD's most dramatic market-share gains have come in the high-margin server and laptop markets, areas where Intel traditionally had little competition.
5467	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	However, Intel, which still commands about three quarters of the overall chip market, fired back at AMD last year by unveiling a new line of chips based on an upgraded design that industry observers cheered for delivering higher performance while giving off less heat.
5472	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Under the current deal, Intel will again provide chips for Sun's x86 line, though this time its Xeon processors are more powerful and boast dramatically improved energy-saving features.
5473	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Sun, which also makes its own line of Sparc branded processors, will still use AMD chips in some of its products, the person close to the deal said.
5474	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Sun, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, is still clawing its way back to profitability after its gutting during the dot-com fallout.
5475	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	The Santa Clara-based company has lost more than $5 billion (euro3.9 billion) since 2002, after tech-related spending dried up and demand plummeted for high-priced servers like Sun's that were snapped up during the boom but fell idle after the dot-com bust.
5476	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Intel's endorsement of the company's Solaris operating system is also an important victory for Sun, as many servers that use chips based on the x86 design often run on Linux or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.
5478	APW_ENG_20070122.0888.LDC2009T13	Though Sun is a "fairly small player" in the market for x86-based servers, coming in sixth in terms of market share, Dhanda said, the company's sales in that market are growing rapidly.

5561	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	International regulators adopted a plan Friday aimed at slowing the decline in global tuna stocks by reining in illegal fishing, controlling the growth of fleets and sharing data on stock assessments.
5564	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Conservationists, however, expressed disappointment the plan did not go far enough to put controls on the industry and address the environmental damage caused by tuna fishing.
5565	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"We do see this meeting as a failure," said Alistair Graham of WWF International.
5566	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The meeting took place amid rising concerns about the sustainability of the world's tuna supply.
5567	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	The final report had been expected to call for closer communication among regulators, especially in sharing information on illegal fishing, scientific calculations of the size of tuna stocks and other issues, delegates said.
5570	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	By 2004, for example, the number of adult Atlantic bluefin tuna capable of spawning had plummeted to roughly 19 percent of the 1975 level in the western half of the ocean, according to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
5572	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Japan, for instance, is campaigning for limits on fishing of smaller tuna, while Europe has resisted the move to protect its canned tuna industry.
5574	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Another key issue is stepped-up monitoring of the regulatory bodies themselves, which have been criticized by conservationists for failing to stop the depletion of tuna stocks.
5575	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Some countries, such as the United States, Canada and Australia, are pushing for tougher oversight for regulators.
5579	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	Critics say excess capacity and profits are determining how many tuna are caught.
5580	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	They argue instead that regulators should decide how many fish can be caught, and then tailor the size of fleets to fit those limits.
5583	APW_ENG_20070126.0472.LDC2009T13	"It's too hard because nobody wants to give up boats," she said.

7157	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Tribeca was launched in 2002, as Rosenthal says, because of an "act of war."
7160	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Because of its origins, Tribeca will always be defined by its connection to Sept. 11 and the continuing reverberations of that tragedy.
7161	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We are a political festival," said Rosenthal in a recent interview in her Tribeca office.
7164	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	That mission expands this year with a series of global warming-themed short films produced by the SOS (Save Our Selves) campaign.
7166	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"We will do things and show things and whether you like it or not, it's something to see and it's ways to ask questions," said Rosenthal.

7174	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	"It's really a sit-in," joked Rosenthal, explaining that the outdoor screenings are her favorite part of the festival.
7177	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	Sponsored by ESPN, Tribeca will present 14 premieres of sports-related films, as well as a screening of the baseball classic "The Natural."

7190	APW_ENG_20070423.1050.LDC2009T13	The festival can similarly boast the first movie directed by Fred Durst, frontman of rock-rap group Limp Bizkit: "The Education of Charlie Banks."

7719	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	A series of problems with radiation machines used to treat brain cancer sufferers -- with malfunctioning machines and some patients receiving overdoses -- is raising questions around France about the safety of the treatment.

7732	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Whether this would have a large or small effect on the patient depends on the part of the brain affected, he said.

7736	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	The problem was identified after 145 patients received an improper dose of radiation from Brainlab equipment in Toulouse in southern France in April.
7738	APW_ENG_20070614.1533.LDC2009T13	Following that incident, Brainlab, in conjunction with two French regulatory bodies, began a nationwide assessment of all Brainlab machines in use, and detected the targeting problem.

8187	APW_ENG_20070711.1331.LDC2009T13	The ex-hostage, security professionals and the gang member asked that no further details be published to protect their identity, and most of those who talked to The Associated Press about government collusion in kidnappings asked for anonymity for similar reasons.

8232	APW_ENG_20070711.1480.LDC2009T13	The bomb that killed Wells was on a timer but it was unclear if his co-conspirators planned on his death, she said.

8361	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The 77 on Friday was the ninth straight round at a major that Mickelson failed to break par, his longest stretch since he played par or worse the final nine rounds of the 1999 season, which included a missed cut at Carnoustie.

8364	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	It was evident on the 15th hole, where Mickelson three-putted from about 60 feet (18 meters) to fall to 4 over par.
8365	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	First, he had caddie Jim "Bones" Mackay stand over the ball to make sure the line was the same as Mickelson had in mind.

8376	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	Mickelson had to put the ball back, then took a penalty drop for an unplayable lie.
8377	APW_ENG_20070720.1232.LDC2009T13	The slope was so steep that he dropped it twice and watched it roll closer to the hole, then had trouble making the ball stay put even after he placed it.

8447	APW_ENG_20070731.0997.LDC2009T13	The stock market rebound this week follows last week's sharp plunge, which was fueled by persistent worries that a deteriorating lending environment will make it harder for companies to borrow money.

10531	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The announcement, which Woods made Tuesday night on his Web site, was a surprise to everyone except those around him.
10537	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	The surgery was performed in Park City, Utah, by Thomas Rosenberg, who also operated on Woods' left knee in December 2002.

10539	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"I made the decision to deal with the pain and schedule the surgery for after the Masters," Woods said on his Web site.
10541	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	I look forward to working through the rehabilitation process and getting back to action as quickly as I can."
10548	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But it was not necessarily a pain-free affair.
10551	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Steinberg said the surgery repaired cartilage damage.
10554	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	This time, it only made sense upon reviewing the past nine months.
10557	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But it sure didn't affect his golf, not even at the Masters, where he finished three shots behind Trevor Immelman.

10574	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	But his health concerns have to come first."
10575	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	Of greater concern might be the fact Woods has gone through surgery twice on the same knee in five years.
10580	APW_ENG_20080416.1203.LDC2009T13	"He deals with stuff incredibly, like you would expect him to."
10587	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	An observer also said ballot boxes were tampered with.

10601	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	Elections officials said the recount was going smoothly.
10606	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	"The repeated miscommunication of venue addresses meant that party agents and electoral observers were frequently posted to the incorrect venue, thus undermining the observation process and contributing to further delays in the recount," she said.
10607	APW_ENG_20080421.0526.LDC2009T13	She went on to list specific instances of ballot box irregularities.

12893	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The problem of melamine in infant formula first surfaced in China in September.
12894	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Sundlof said the lack of dual contamination was key because studies so far show dangerous health effects only when both chemicals are present.

12896	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The agency still will not set a safety level for melamine if cyanuric acid is also present, he said.

12907	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	Those levels were below what FDA found in the other formulas, an Abbott spokesman said, and below any national safety guidelines.
12909	APW_ENG_20081129.0494.LDC2009T13	The FDA and other experts have said they believe the melamine contamination in U.S.-made formula had occurred during the manufacturing process, rather than intentionally.

12986	APW_ENG_20081210.0985.LDC2009T13	Those economic releases are likely to remind investors of the gloom hanging over the U.S. economy, just as poor European economic figures Wednesday weighed on stocks in early trading.

13035	APW_ENG_20081215.0125.LDC2009T13	Palin, the former Republican vice presidential candidate, did not attend services Sunday because she was in Juneau preparing to propose a state budget, said her spokesman, Bill McAllister.

13126	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	She said the White House was close to a decision and emphasized there were still several possible approaches to assisting the automakers, such as short-term loans out of a $700 billion Wall Street rescue fund.
13127	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	Bush has resisted this approach before, and it is adamantly opposed by many other Republicans.
13129	APW_ENG_20081218.0897.LDC2009T13	She said one of the factors delaying an announcement on an auto rescue plan is the continuing discussion between the administration and the various sides that would have to sign on to a managed bankruptcy, such as labor unions and equity holders in addition to the companies themselves.
13138	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Investors poured more money into Treasurys on Thursday, sending yields to record lows again even as the Treasury Department said it would sell record amounts of notes next week.
13140	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	However, after the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it was considering buying long-term government debt, investors are not yet worried about a drop-off in demand.

13146	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Both those figures were the highest amounts on record.
13147	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	It's possible that if enough supply comes into the market, it will keep yields low enough for a long enough period of time that investors will look for riskier assets offering higher returns.

13159	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	Economic data released Thursday were not as grim as many anticipated, but still evinced a very weak climate.
13163	APW_ENG_20081218.1231.LDC2009T13	That was slightly better than expected.
13169	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The sharp downturn in the economy had put Schwartz's group -- working to improve treatment of teen offenders with mental illnesses -- under very tight budget pressure.
13170	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	At least the check was a promise he could count on.
13171	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	By that Thursday, though, events were unfolding 160 miles (258 kilometers) away that would upend those assumptions and assurances.
13177	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Except, it turned out, the money.
13178	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In the days since Madoff's Dec. 11 arrest, the tale has repeatedly been told of wealthy victims who, perhaps naively, invested their trust in a man who promised financial miracles.
13179	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But the scale of the Madoff scandal can just as well be measured in its still-widening ripples, reaching far-flung people and causes -- from a group helping just-released inmates find jobs in Rhode Island to another working to provide fresh food in poor neighborhoods in Detroit and Oakland, California.
13189	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The real estate broker and the money manager were separated by 26 years, but they and their families had formed a friendship reinforced by shared interests, social circles -- and trust.
13193	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When Norman F. Levy died, he was staying at his daughter's house fronting the Atlantic, just a few sprawling lots away from the mansion owned by the Madoffs.

13200	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	When Norman Levy died, they took the helm of the family philanthropy, leaving the funds invested with Madoff, whose offices were housed in the same Third Avenue tower as the foundation.
13202	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But its biggest checks went to a new set of organizations created by Norman Levy's children to champion causes they embraced.
13204	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Last year, the Levy family financed JEHT to the tune of $29.9 million.
13207	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	In 2007, the Levy Foundation financed Philoctetes with $950,000.
13208	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Last year, Francis Levy invited his family's longtime friend, Madoff, to appear on a panel at the center to talk about the workings of Wall Street.
13218	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	Still, Schwartz's staff of 11 was so certain of JEHT's backing that they moved ahead with new projects, spending about $25,000 in advance.
13219	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"We just trusted that we would get the money, and so rather than suspend the work until the check was in hand ... we do the work and expected the check will follow," Schwartz said.
13222	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	His benefactors, Jeanne and Kenneth Levy Church, were on the line.
13223	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	"Are you sitting down?"
13226	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	All the Levy Church's money was invested with Bernie Madoff.
13227	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	If it was gone, so was the foundation.
13229	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	The checks they had been expecting would not be coming, he told them, and JEHT would close by the end of January.
13235	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	JEHT provides a third of its annual budget, but the check for 2009 had already been cashed.
13237	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	For others, the impact was immediate.
13241	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But those are emergency measures, not a solution.
13245	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	All the attention swirling around Madoff has been about his wealthy lifestyle and the ultra-rich investors in places like Palm Beach and Hollywood and New York who lost their shirts.
13246	APW_ENG_20081220.0593.LDC2009T13	But few seem to understand the repercussions.

13408	CNA_ENG_20071218.0047.LDC2009T13	A total of 13 lawmakers from various political parties have received threatening letters from Yang, and maverick lawmaker Lee Ao has received two.
13415	CNA_ENG_20080212.0019.LDC2009T13	The contribution for the month of December has raised the company's total contribution in 2007 to NT$15.5 billion, the spokesman noted.
13416	CNA_ENG_20080212.0019.LDC2009T13	Of the December donation, NT$908 million, or 50 percent, goes to local governments to fund their social welfare and charity events, the spokesman said.
13418	CNA_ENG_20080212.0019.LDC2009T13	Another NT$817 million, or 45 percent of the December total, is used to sponsor the national pension scheme, according to the spokesman.
13419	CNA_ENG_20080212.0019.LDC2009T13	The remaining NT$90.8 million, or 5 percent, is allocated as reserve funds for the national health insurance program, the spokesman said.
13420	CNA_ENG_20080212.0019.LDC2009T13	In related news, no winner of the TLC's Super Lotto jackpot prize -- NT$470 million -- was produced Monday for the sixth time in a row.
13436	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	As to whether he felt despondent about the extremely low voter turnout for the two referendums held alongside the Jan. 12 legislative elections, Chen replied: "Not at all."
13437	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"Even though the referendums failed to pass the legal thresholds required for them to take effect, I don't think they were flops," Chen argued.
13438	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	One of the referendums was initiated by the DPP and asked voters whether the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should be required to return to the national coffers its ill-gotten party assets.
13446	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"We should look at the incident from a macro-perspective, rather than just taking it as an isolated case.
13449	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Chen revealed that he plans to come up with a new nomination list for Control Yuan seats for confirmation by the legislature, in which the KMT controls a more-than two-thirds majority.
13455	CNA_ENG_20080315.0014.LDC2009T13	"If there hadn't been the past eight years of DPP rule and myself as president, Taiwan would have been taken by China after six years, " he said.

13478	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	It marked the first time the KMT chairman has headed to Japan to promote party- to-party exchanges since the KMT came to power in May.
13479	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	During the visit, Wu and his team are expected to meet with leaders of major political parties in Japan and several senior politicians who have assumed important government positions.
13482	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Taiwan and Japan are very close to each other geographically, share many common interests and have deep historical links, with bilateral trade amounting to US$60 billion and more than 2.5 million visitors traveling between the countries per year, Wu quoted Ma as saying the day before.
13484	CNA_ENG_20081207.0013.LDC2009T13	Wu said Japan may suffer some losses as a transportation hub after direct air and shipping links between Taiwan and China are developed, but that overall Japan will continue to benefit from closer Taiwan-China exchanges.

13494	LTW_ENG_20070123.0152.LDC2009T13	``This tragedy took 3,000 lives and continues to take our lives today,'' Sferazo, president and co-founder of Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes, said at a news conference Monday at the World Trade Center site.
13502	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Texas on Friday became the first state to require school-age girls be vaccinated against a virus -- typically transmitted through sex -- that has been shown to cause cervical cancer.
13503	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Gov. Rick Perry signed an executive order mandating that most girls, starting in September 2008, must receive the vaccination against the human papilloma virus, or HPV, prior to entering sixth grade.
13504	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	More than a dozen states have been considering such a move.
13505	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	HPV, which causes genital warts, is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States.
13506	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Several strains of the virus have been linked to cervical cancer, which kills about 3,700 Americans a year, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
13507	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	The federal government approved an HPV vaccine last year, and a government advisory panel has recommended that all girls get shots at age 11 or 12 -- before they begin having sex.
13510	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	Perry defended his decision Friday, arguing that the vaccinations are needed to save lives.
13513	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``The HPV vaccine provides us with an incredible opportunity to effectively target and prevent cervical cancer,'' Perry said in a statement.
13514	LTW_ENG_20070203.0123.LDC2009T13	``Requiring young girls to get vaccinated before they come into contact with HPV is responsible health and fiscal policy.''

13546	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	``I have no idea,'' said Stanislawa Zielke, 49, when asked why she thought Poland had sent its troops -- the third largest Iraq coalition force after the United States and Britain.
13548	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Al-Qaida did not attack Poland, people say -- though perhaps now it will, they quip.
13552	LTW_ENG_20070301.0063.LDC2009T13	Poland announced late last year that its troops will stay in Iraq through this year and, privately, politicians expect levels to be maintained for years.

13583	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	In the new comedy ``Wild Hogs,'' Tim Allen, John Travolta, William H. Macy and Martin Lawrence play weekend warrior buddies from Cincinnati who jump on their Harleys and take a road trip to the Pacific in hopes of pepping up their humdrum suburban lives.
13589	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	And there are hundreds of thousands of Harley riders who are trying to regain that feeling.''

13595	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	In the film, which opens Friday, Allen's Doug is happily married with a young son but is bored with his mundane job as a dentist
13597	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Macy's Dudley is a computer nerd who is too shy to talk to women
13600	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I had one after college.
13603	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	All three actors, as well as Becker, had a history with motorcycles.
13606	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	I had a cousin there who was a mechanic and he would reassemble them.
13607	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Once we got there we would ride these bikes around with a bunch of friends and sell them for, like, four or five times what we paid for them.''
13608	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	His father, he added, was a weekend warrior biker just like the Hogs.

13614	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Travolta has been riding motorcycles since he was a struggling young actor in Los Angeles in the early 1970s.
13615	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``It was economical transportation in California,'' he said.

13620	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``I am looking forward to owning a Harley again.''
13621	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	Travolta is passionate about bikes because there's a certain sensation to riding a bike.
13625	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	But because he was rusty and had never ridden a Harley, Macy took lessons from the film's stunt coordinator, Jack Gill.
13628	LTW_ENG_20070301.0079.LDC2009T13	``There is nothing like it, man,'' enthused Macy.

13659	LTW_ENG_20070313.0069.LDC2009T13	The whole thing was like an out-of-body experience.''
13666	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Now's the time to buy.
13668	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Prices have been basically stalled since the retail wars of the 2006 holidays, when LCD TVs, once luxury items, went almost mainstream.
13670	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	A 42-inch set currently selling for an average $1,877 could be going for $1,175 -- a drop of more than 35 percent -- just in time for the winter holidays, the iSuppli research group said Tuesday.
13673	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Now I could get it for $149,'' said Richard Doherty of the Envisioneering Group.
13675	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	If the price falls as much as expected this year, the average 42-inch LCD set will cost only about $80 less than a plasma flat- screen of the same size.
13676	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	For years, plasma was the undisputed flat-screen king, largely because the technology was far cheaper.
13677	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	But now LCDs could rule -- especially among the environmentally- and weight-conscious.
13678	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``LCD TVs use a lot less electricity,'' Doherty said.
13680	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	And the weight of two 37-inch LCD TVs are about equal to that of one plasma set the same size.''
13683	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	This year, the number of raw LCD screens -- each of which contains a liquid crystal gel divided into hundreds of thousands of individual pixels -- shipping from factories will reach 75.2 million, up from 52.7 in 2006, iSuppli said.
13692	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	``That's an awesome price for the consumer but it was hard on everyone in the TV supply chain because it was such a low profit margin.''
13693	LTW_ENG_20070314.0171.LDC2009T13	Since then, LCD prices have stayed nearly the same, or gone slightly up in some cases.

13725	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	After failing to remove Shahwani in 2005, Shiite officials sought to fill the gap.
13726	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The minister of state for national security at the time, Abdel Kareem Anizi, lobbied al-Jaafari to turn his post into a fully funded ministry charged with security affairs.

13752	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	In their most controversial operation, Waeli's agents have spied on at least one Sunni Parliament member for alleged terrorist activities.

13759	LTW_ENG_20070415.0059.LDC2009T13	The fact remains that Waeli and the rest of Shiite-led government have not pursued any investigations of Shiite Parliament members suspected of involvement in sectarian killings.

13870	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Before the trial, Fields said in interviews that he was outraged at plans by Anschutz's lawyers to portray Cussler as a ``crazed racist and anti-Semite.''
13873	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	``They want to get these charges in front of a jury,'' Fields said, ``so blacks and Jews will hate him.''
13875	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	The transcripts reveal that Fields was vigilant about making sure no witness so much as suggested to the jury that his client uttered a racial or anti-Semitic slur.

13884	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	After Shook denied a request for a mistrial, Rader shot back, ``I believe Mr. Fields should be admonished and instructed never to pull that stunt again.''
13889	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Anschutz's lawyers also accused Fields of coming ``very close'' during his opening statement to violating a court order that prohibited anyone from telling the jury the reason Cussler had fired his longtime publicist.
13891	LTW_ENG_20070501.0152.LDC2009T13	Cussler appeared to violate the order April 19 when he testified that Shook wouldn't let him explain the firing.

13987	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Manufacturing restrictions during World War II doomed soundies: There once were 10,000 operating in North America, but by 1946, that number had fallen to 2,000.
13988	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies were an opportunity for people to see some of the country's greatest musicians performing for only a dime, though a Panoram wasn't quite as efficient as a regular jukebox: Eight soundies, featuring a variety of musical performances, would be spliced together on a reel, which ran in a continuous loop, so you couldn't really pick out a favorite.
13990	LTW_ENG_20070608.0014.LDC2009T13	Soundies are fascinating time capsules not only of music but of social history, dance styles and fashions in 1940s America.

14009	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Things are so bad that this month federal judges will begin holding hearings on whether to impose inmate population caps.
14012	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But there's at least one safe, simple and immediate thing the state could do that would free up prison beds and save millions: parole inmates who are too old to be dangerous.
14013	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Prisoners are expensive to confine, and none more so than elderly ones.
14015	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But elderly inmates typically cost up to three times more, primarily because of their greater medical needs.
14016	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Many older prisoners are five to 10 years ``older'' physiologically than their chronological age, their bodies prematurely worn down from years of alcohol and drug abuse and the stress of prison life.
14019	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	That's no small matter in a state where the correctional system has grown to gargantuan proportions.
14020	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Fifteen years ago, California incarcerated about 105,000 inmates
14023	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	The Department of Corrections will spend almost $1.8 billion on medical care this year, double the amount of just five years ago.
14031	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	But in general, releasing ailing elderly prisoners under the ongoing supervision of a parole officer is a pretty safe bet.
14032	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Study after study has found that the recidivism rate for prisoners 55 or older is far lower than that of younger ones.
14033	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	And the cost of monitoring a convict in California on parole is about one-eighth that of keeping one in prison.
14034	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	There's a nonfinancial benefit, too.
14035	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Letting sick, feeble old men and women live out their last days at home with their families is more humane than letting them slowly disintegrate in cellblocks filled with predatory younger inmates.
14036	LTW_ENG_20070608.0035.LDC2009T13	Even those who would wind up alone on the outside, living off Social Security, veterans benefits or welfare still would cost taxpayers less than keeping them in prison.

14054	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His promotion of national pride was at the center of one of his last books, ``Achieving Our Country'' (1998).
14056	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His early life as a philosopher dropped few, if any, clues of an unusual upbringing.
14061	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	When he was 8, he sent a present and note of congratulations to ``a fellow 8-year- old who had made good'' -- the newly enthroned Dalai Lama.
14070	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	Over the next decade, his early influences resurfaced and, in a conversion that Watson described as ``fairly wild,'' Rorty found himself being led back to Dewey.
14071	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His rediscovery of pragmatism was at the heart of ``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,'' in which he wrote that the purpose of philosophy was not to deliver eternal truths but to ``sustain a conversation.''
14073	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	``Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' was disparaged by many of Rorty's fellow philosophers, who turned ``Rortyism'' into a pejorative.
14076	LTW_ENG_20070613.0145.LDC2009T13	His broadening influence was recognized in 1981, when he was named one of the first recipients of a MacArthur ``genius'' grant, which bestows a handsome monetary prize on individuals whose creative work shows originality and continued promise.

14168	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The case raised broader questions about who, if anyone, deserves to be punished for the deaths in Katrina's deadly flooding.
14169	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	While numerous government agencies have been faulted for the disaster, the Manganos were the first and only people to be tried in a criminal court for any of the countless mistakes of planning that led to 1,800 deaths in the flooding that followed the storm late in summer 2005.
14182	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	"Sal and Mabel are the only two people on the planet charged with anything," defense attorney James Cobb noted in closing arguments.
14187	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Maybe it was because they feared the potentially lethal dangers of transporting their frail clientele, or maybe they were trying to avoid the expense -- they have never explained why publicly, and did not testify in their own defense.
14192	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	During the trial, prosecutors had suggested that the Manganos were too cheap to evacuate their residents, amounting to a "reckless disregard" for their patients' safety.
14193	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	Noting that three other nursing homes in St. Bernard Parish did evacuate, the prosecutors argued that the Manganos decided to gamble with people's lives.
14195	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The evidence that financial concerns drove their decision, however, was relatively scant: A witness testified that after a hurricane-preparedness meeting several years ago, Mabel Mangano told her, "Unless the hurricane is coming in my back door, I'm not putting my residents through an evacuation and wasting money."
14196	LTW_ENG_20070908.0142.LDC2009T13	The defense attorneys argued that the Manganos chose to "shelter in place" because they cared about their residents and feared the potentially lethal dangers of transporting their frail clientele.

14241	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	-- It is less risky.
14242	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Leaving forces behind leaves them vulnerable.
14244	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	-- It gets our troops out of the quagmire and strengthens us for our real challenges.
14245	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	It is foolish to think that 20,000 to 75,000 troops could bring peace to Iraq when 160,000 have not.
14249	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Over the seven years it took to get our troops out, 21,000 more Americans and perhaps a million Vietnamese, most of them civilians, died.
14252	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	If Congress fails to end this war, I will remove all troops without delay, and without hesitation, beginning on my first day in office.
14253	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	Let's stop pretending that all Democratic plans are similar.
14256	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	For how long?
14257	LTW_ENG_20070909.0013.LDC2009T13	To do what, exactly?
14261	LTW_ENG_20070917.0037.LDC2009T13	When: Monday night
14263	LTW_ENG_20070917.0037.LDC2009T13	Rating: TV-14-LV (may be unsuitable for children younger than 14, with advisories for coarse language and violence)
14265	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	It's no secret that many printers are sold as loss leaders.
14274	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But I've changed my mind after spending a week with the new Epson PictureMate Dash.
14280	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	With a 6- by 8-inch footprint, the PictureMate Dash doesn't claim much desktop real estate.
14288	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	The buttons and menus made navigation easy -- I could view one shot at time or peruse a lineup of thumbnail images (actually, in that small window, they're really "pinkynail" images, but still viewable).
14289	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	One irritant of digital photography is that cameras record images with a 4-to-3 aspect ratio -- the same proportion as standard TV screens and PC monitors.
14290	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Unfortunately, most commercial photo paper and picture frames are designed to accommodate 4- by 6-inch prints, with their elongated aspect ratio.
14294	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	What amazed me was how little adjustment most decent exposures needed.
14296	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Each one took about 45 seconds, which is more than twice as fast as my general-purpose printer, an aging but reliable HP Photosmart 1100.
14299	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	They include thumbnail images of all the photos on a card, dual wallet-size or four mini-wallet-size prints, double passport-size photos, 3- or 4-inch square images, and other entertaining if less-than-useful options.
14302	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	It produced excellent prints, as did Adobe PhotoShop Elements and Microsoft's Digital Imaging, the two photo-editing programs I normally use.
14303	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For prints with a long life, I usually recommend photofinishing services, which use real photographic paper and chemistry, instead of ink.
14304	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But Epson now claims its inks will last 96 years under glass and 200 years in a closed album -- a lot longer than I'll ever last.
14305	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Can you believe those claims?
14306	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Who knows, since tests can only simulate the effects of time.
14310	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	But my take is that the per-print price is on the low end, considering the quality.
14311	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	For those with bigger budgets and more ambition, Epson makes a $200 version of this printer called the PictureMate Zoom with a built-in CD burner.
14312	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	This accessory allows users to make photo CDs for friends and family, but it sounds pretty expensive for marginal additional utility.
14313	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	Bottom line: Given its reasonable upfront cost, superb images and economy of operation, it's hard to find much fault with the basic PictureMate Dash.
14314	LTW_ENG_20070921.0072.LDC2009T13	If you're getting started with digital photography and don't want to use a computer as middleman, the PictureMate Dash does a great job with images straight out of the camera.

14322	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The agreement would eliminate nearly all trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, between the U.S. and the other six participants over the next 10 years.
14323	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Pro-CAFTA forces were jubilant Sunday night, dancing and cheering when the election tribunal announced early results of the referendum.
14326	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"Now we're one whole," Volio said.
14327	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	"There is no `Yes.'
14328	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	There is no `No.'
14330	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica is the first nation to put a trade agreement to a national referendum.
14339	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	Costa Rica was the only nation in the seven-member pact that hadn't ratified the agreement, which includes the United States, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
14346	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The agreement exposes state-run sectors such as telecommunications and insurance to competition from foreign companies.
14348	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The United States has struggled recently to push its trade agenda in Latin America.
14349	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	A planned Free Trade Area for the Americas plan has stalled largely because of opposition from regional giant Brazil.
14350	LTW_ENG_20071008.0026.LDC2009T13	The referendum split Costa Rica, a coffee-producing nation of 4 million people known for its political stability in a region that was torn by civil wars in the 1980s.
14353	LTW_ENG_20071013.0016.LDC2009T13	20071013.0016
14359	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	After its 1847 premiere (Verdi revised it in 1865), the composer dedicated it to his beloved father-in-law, calling it "dearer to me than all my other operas."
14360	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Verdi reportedly made the first Macbeth and Lady Macbeth rehearse their great duet 150 times -- the last time with cloaks over their costumes, in the theater lobby, while the world premiere audience waited impatiently.
14363	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	The Metropolitan Opera, which last performed "Macbeth" in 1988, got some of this right in its new production.
14369	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	By and large, the sounds she emitted had only a glancing relationship to Verdi's music.
14372	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	A grave, dignified Banquo, John Relyea offered a fine sense of style and unfocused tone.
14376	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	Levine's savage, venomous reading of the score was beyond praise, studded with grim, yawning silences and chords that thudded and crashed with the finality of death.
14379	LTW_ENG_20071027.0052.LDC2009T13	"MacBeth," at the Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center.
14381	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	A few months ago, no list of the upcoming fall season's most anticipated video games would have been complete without "Grand Theft Auto IV" -- but that was before the game was delayed until next year.
14383	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Plenty -- and we're not even including "Halo 3," which doesn't make our cut because it's already in stores.
14384	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	In fact, despite a sequel-heavy release slate for the holiday season, only a couple such titles are included here.
14385	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	These games look promising enough to deserve spots on your holiday wish list:
14386	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Mass Effect"
14388	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 20
14389	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Action/role-playing
14391	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	From the developer of "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" and "Jade Empire," "Mass Effect" puts players into the shoes of a human who must accomplish a familiar goal: Stop the extinction of all intelligent life in the galaxy.
14392	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	But "Mass Effect" aims to distinguish itself in how players choose to accomplish that quest.
14394	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Rock Band"
14396	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Nov. 23 (Xbox 360, PS3)
14398	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Rhythm
14399	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Sure, the "Guitar Hero" series has the pedigree (and a new version, "Guitar Hero III," out this week), but "Rock Band" has the buzz.
14400	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	As well it should -- by turning your family room into a concert hall, it's poised to give "Guitar Hero" all it can handle in the battle of the virtual bands.
14401	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	The "Rock Band" bundle will include the game, a guitar, a drum set and a microphone, for a whopping $170 ($160 for the PS2 version) -- and that's not including a second guitar, which the game also supports.
14403	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Rock on.
14404	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Assassin's Creed"
14407	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Genre: Action/adventure
14413	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	From the early looks we've had of the game, the trick is knowing when to take flight and when to slow down, bow your head and blend in with the crowd.
14421	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	This time, though, Mario's actions are managed by the motion- sensing Wii controller.
14422	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	And the worlds he must explore are unlike any others in previous games.
14427	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: This week
14429	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	It's difficult to pick a genre for "The Simpsons Game" -- simply because, in true Simpsons fashion, it lampoons them all.
14432	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Marge, for instance, in an effort to boycott the violent game-within-a-game Grand Theft Scratchy, has the power to use her megaphone to recruit townspeople for her angry mob -- which she can then command to destroy anyone or anything that gets in her way.
14434	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	"Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"
14435	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Platform: Xbox 360, PS3, PCs
14436	LTW_ENG_20071102.0047.LDC2009T13	Release date: Monday
14450	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	It's not exactly a babe magnet.
14458	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Caroline Wilmoth, 18, drives a 2007 Toyota Scion tC, which sells for less than $20,000 and gets about 23 miles per gallon in the city.
14464	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Maybe it was the day of the week (Thursday).
14469	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"The car market is terrible, if you want to know the truth," he said.
14475	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	But there's a perception in the marketplace that a Buick, say, is somehow inferior.
14478	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"I personally won't buy a non-American car," Nielsen said.
14481	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's a nifty bumper sticker, but it's not exactly a selling point.
14482	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	The U.S. car market is nothing if not competitive, and consumers will look elsewhere if a particular automaker doesn't strike their fancy.
14484	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's especially true as fuel prices flirt with record highs.
14485	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	The price of a barrel of crude topped $98 on Wednesday before easing a tad.
14486	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	Oil was trading around $96 a barrel on Friday.
14490	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	That's 13.7 cents higher than a week before, 31 cents above the month-earlier level and nearly $1 more than a year ago.
14494	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	A black Hummer H2 was selling for $65,955.
14502	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	So I went back to the Toyota showroom, where rock music was playing and a smattering of customers were browsing among the vehicles.
14503	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	William Stackhouse, 85, was having some maintenance done on his 2007 Prius.
14504	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	I asked how he felt about buying American.
14505	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	"That's a nice idea," Stackhouse replied.
14507	LTW_ENG_20071111.0021.LDC2009T13	So does Detroit.
14513	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	My eyes stinging, I raced past the burned-out shell of a bus.
14514	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Thick smoke filled the air, but there was just enough of a clearing to allow me a glimpse of El Catedral restaurant.
14517	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	I kept running.
14518	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Fast-forward one year and I'm finally inside El Catedral, and in a city that feels much different.
14519	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Seated under the stars on an ancient stone patio, a fountain burbling beside me, I savor sauteed mushrooms in garlic wine sauce.
14520	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The setting is almost exactly as I envisioned it would be: a place of architectural jewels, one-of-a-kind textiles and culinary surprises.
14522	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The two-story bar, all polished wood and chrome, is dark.
14528	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Nor, however, is it the bustling cultural center of years past.
14534	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But he also wants Americans to appreciate its warmth and beauty.
14535	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"I would advise people to come, as long as they come with their eyes open," he says.
14536	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"But this is not Disneyland."
14538	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Translated literally, the phrase means "more or less."
14540	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	For adventurous travelers, "mas o menos" can also translate to opportunity.
14542	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Smith, for instance, negotiated half-price rates at the nearby beaches of Puerto Escondido.
14547	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Now in her 70s, with cropped red hair and kitschy-cool Mexican- silver skeletons dangling from her ears, O'Brien loves Oaxaca so much she even came during the riots.
14553	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But she is sad: "It hasn't staged a real comeback yet."
14556	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The city (population before the riots: 258,000) was laid out by Spaniards in the mid- 1500s, and its streets are lined by mossy relics of that era.
14558	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Protest is as much a part of Oaxaca's tradition as its black clay pottery and hand-woven tapestries.
14559	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	So when the city's teachers announced their perennial strike in May 2006, it barely caused a stir.
14562	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	The city once known for picturesque cathedrals, graceful laurel trees and colorful marketplaces was coated in graffiti and strewn with the charred remains of vehicles.
14564	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Masked protesters countered with guerrilla tactics, hurling burning tires and rocks collected from the cobblestone streets.
14568	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Officially, Oaxaca is back to normal.
14576	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	But in its effort to remove the ugly barricades and trash, the government also swept away a bit of Oaxaca's soul.
14580	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	He is friendly, helpful and definitely not de la Vega.
14582	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"We just couldn't make it," she tells me later in a telephone interview.
14584	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	we couldn't get deliveries
14585	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	we couldn't pay the rent.
14587	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Andrew Peterson, the new owner, proudly announces that he has changed every recipe on the menu save one: de la Vega's gazpacho.
14589	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	Neither dish stands out, and Rexer grumbles that he has trouble detecting any chilies in his allegedly spicy shrimp.
14594	LTW_ENG_20071128.0003.LDC2009T13	"The last four months were the worst," says Evans, better known by his nickname, Lalo.
14615	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But the most significant improvements have been in outlying areas, where the first surge troops arrived at the start of the year, followed by gradual improvements in Baghdad.
14616	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Planners at first thought it would be the other way around.
14617	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"There was a sense we would focus very significantly on Baghdad and change would come from Baghdad-out," said a senior military official in Washington, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing troop strategy.
14625	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Nonetheless, the international military pullback from outlying areas is under way.
14631	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	"There are different schools of thought here," Anderson said in an interview in his office at the U.S. military headquarters at Camp Victory.
14633	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	That's our view."
14635	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Instead, officials have pinned their hopes on incremental progress at the provincial level.
14644	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	It is just not attainable," the senior military official in Washington, D.C., said.

14652	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	But at least one aide to Odierno, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the violence appears more likely to be tied to ongoing sectarian disputes in the region over the eventual boundaries of the Kurdistan region.
14654	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. military officials insisted the focus on Baghdad is not indicative of a lack of success in the capital.
14655	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	Violence is down significantly, they note, and services are being restored.
14657	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	For example, public services provided by the central government are aimed largely at Shiite neighborhoods at the expense of Sunni areas.
14658	LTW_ENG_20071216.0044.LDC2009T13	In addition, the multiethnic makeup of the capital makes it the most difficult part of the country to achieve reconciliation between once- warring factions.

14783	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	In September, Simpson, 60, and several others were charged with entering a hotel room and taking sports memorabilia at gunpoint.
14787	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	The trial is scheduled to begin in April.
14788	LTW_ENG_20080117.0053.LDC2009T13	Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, who set the original bail on Sept. 19, was insistent that Simpson not have any contact with anyone involved in the case.
14801	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	That decline, in turn, was at least partially responsible for the Federal Reserve's extraordinary 3/4-point rate cut on Tuesday.
14803	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	During a conference call Thursday in Paris, bank officials said that they completed unwinding all the transactions from Monday through Wednesday before publicly disclosing the fraud.
14804	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	They said the bank suffered an "enormous loss" because of unfavorable market conditions.
14806	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Those markets plummeted by more than 5 percent on Monday on the heels of a steep sell off in Asian markets.
14807	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	The Fed announced its rate cut early the following morning.
14809	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Societe Generale's loss swamps the previous high-water mark for activity by a rogue trader -- that set by Nicholas Leeson, who lost $1.3 billion in Asian futures and other derivatives at Barings Bank in 1995.
14812	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	It is the owner of Los Angeles-based TCW Group, the parent of Trust Company of the West, which manages $153 billion for clients.
14823	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Although Lea and other analysts speculated that the loss might make Societe Generale more vulnerable to a takeover, Bouton turned away questions about that possibility.
14825	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Kerviel -- whom Societe Generale executives did not name but who was identified in news reports from Europe -- began working at the bank's back office in 2000, when he was assigned to help fashion the internal programs that placed transaction limits on individual traders.
14827	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	This involves making countervailing bets on the future performance of stocks as an insurance policy against adverse moves in the bank's stock portfolio.
14828	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	His salary was pegged at 100,000 euros, or about $146,000 a year, including bonus
14831	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Using the knowledge he had gained in the back office, he concealed his actions by fabricating balancing trades -- using "extremely sophisticated and varied techniques," as Bouton said in his letter to shareholders.
14833	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	just before the start of the new year, however, he undertook a huge bet that European stock markets would rise in January.
14834	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Instead, they fell sharply, losing nearly 10 percent through last Friday.
14840	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	There was no evidence that he personally profited from his scheme.
14842	LTW_ENG_20080125.0140.LDC2009T13	Baum reported from Paris and Hiltzik from Los Angeles.
14846	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	But there are enough differences between the two studies to cloud the source of the discrepancy, experts said.
14852	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Healthy individuals have an A1C level of about 6 percent, while normal treatment regimens achieve levels of 7 percent to 7.5 percent.
14855	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The ADVANCE study enrolled 11,140 high-risk patients in Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada and had treatment goals similar to that of the ACCORD trial.
14858	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	No other results from the study were released.
14859	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	A final report is expected later this year, along with results from a third trial that is also underway.
14862	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	The patients in the ACCORD trial also received a drug that is not available in the United States.
14863	LTW_ENG_20080214.0118.LDC2009T13	Physicians said they hope that publication of all three reports will enable them to resolve the discrepancies.

14872	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"As Ohio goes, so goes the nation," she added.
14874	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	The former first lady led Obama by 57 percent to 41 percent with 63 percent of the precincts reporting at 11:15 p.m. Clinton held a 50 percent to 49 percent lead in Texas with 39 percent of precincts reporting.
14877	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	But Obama, who has enjoyed one of the great hot streaks in modern political history, matched her, breezing to a two-to-one win in Vermont.
14884	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	"This is one of the most civil and positive primary campaigns I can remember."
14888	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Voting in Texas, which has a complicated primary-caucus hybrid system, went smoothly at first amid huge turnout.
14889	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	But the caucuses, which used to select 35 percent of the state's delegates, were marred by delays and late Tuesday the Clinton campaign accused Obama workers of illegally pre-registering caucus-goers in eight precincts.
14891	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	Exit polls showed her with a two-to-one advantage among Lone Star State Hispanics -- although Obama bested her among Latinos age 18 to 29.
14893	LTW_ENG_20080305.0177.LDC2009T13	She was buoyed by an ABC News poll showing that Americans supported her remaining in the race by a two-to-one vote, provided she won either Texas or Ohio.
14897	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Gatsby, I reminded them, is a damned fool who falls in love with a woman unworthy of his affection.
14900	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	We like him right from the start, but when he says, "OK, I'll go to hell" -- that's when we fall in love.
14902	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Later, I lay awake in the dark thinking about how a novel about Eliot Spitzer might go and what kind of novel it would be.
14904	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He would not be a hypocrite.
14905	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	My Eliot would believe with his whole heart in his crusades against the corrupt and the powerful and the privileged, even as he worked studiously to undermine his legacy.
14906	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Fiction can accommodate such paradoxes, provided they're explained.
14907	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But I don't mean to jigger the facts
14908	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	fictive Eliot will do exactly what the real Eliot has done, only my guy almost never imagines getting caught.
14911	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He will swerve at the last moment.
14916	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	People will understand that he's mostly good.
14917	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	By the time my Eliot realizes that he's wrong about all this, it's too late.
14922	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Not giving his nasty, righteous streak enough play.
14923	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's possible I'm giving him more credit than God would, but then God has the advantage of knowing what Eliot and I are still trying to figure out.
14926	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why does she stand there beside him at the podium when he confesses?
14929	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I make a list of what I know (not much) and what I suspect (not much more) and wonder whether imagination will fill in all those blanks.
14934	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What I know about marriage is that identities over time tend to merge.
14935	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Eliot's wife was once her own person, but down the years she's lost some of that individuality, surrendered it willingly, never suspecting she might have further use for it.
14936	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	If she's not this man's wife, then who is she?
14944	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why aren't her emotions?
14945	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Why won't they stand still so she can examine them?
14946	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	And what of those daughters?
14948	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	What really tears him apart is that when the news breaks, these girls are going to have to go to school.
14953	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Some of it can be repaired.
14954	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	They're good, smart girls, and they won't grow up hating all men.
14955	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But their innocence has fled
14956	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	they look at him now like a man wearing a partially removed disguise.
14957	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Never again will they take anything on faith.
14959	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	They'll brace for impact when there's no reason.
14960	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He could have spared them all this, yet managed not to.
14962	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Time for a little comic relief.
14963	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Real-life Eliot has few friends, we're told, the natural result of what some people like to call his arrogance, though my Eliot has never thought of it in those terms until now.
14966	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Wasn't that his job?
14967	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Is that any reason he should be friendless now?
14969	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I'll give this friend some of my own cynical humor.
14973	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Before everything begins to unravel, Eliot confides to Rick that he's made a mess of things, betrayed everyone he loves, that he isn't even sure who he is anymore.
14975	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's true that he's made mistakes, big ones, Rick explains, but they aren't what Eliot thinks they are.
14976	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Rick admits he's outraged that Eliot has spent $80,000 on prostitutes, because it shouldn't cost that much to get a little action in America.
14977	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	It's like one of those $500 Pentagon hammers.
14978	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Downright wasteful.
14980	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	There are perfectly good hammers in Washington -- it's a damned city of hammers, when you think about it.
14983	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Don't joke, Eliot tells Rick.
14985	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	he could go to jail.
14986	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	But to Rick's way of thinking, that's the biggest joke of all.
14988	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	You want to know what you're really guilty of, Eliot?
14989	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Cluelessness.
14990	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	You didn't forget who you are, you forgot where you are.
14991	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	This is America, pal, where you can lead the nation into war on false pretenses and be rewarded with a second term in office, but where illicit sex is and has always been an impeachable offense.
14992	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	(Note to self: A little of this Rick character goes a long way.)
14993	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	How will my Eliot's story end?
14996	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	A tragedy?
14998	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	My Eliot's no Gatsby, and there's no reason he should wind up floating face-down in the pool.
15000	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He's had a great opportunity, and he's blown it.
15003	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He will survive.
15007	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	Well, for one, there's historical precedent.
15009	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	I wouldn't pretend to know what's in her heart, but she's clearly functioning.
15012	LTW_ENG_20080316.0026.LDC2009T13	He knows this even as some other part of him believes what people are telling him because, of course, he wants to.

15024	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	In this case, though, they face the challenge of ensuring that the president is safe from all sorts of theoretical dangers and capable of running the country from midair during a crisis.
15025	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"You don't think of it in terms of what's the cost of the individual helicopter," said Jacques Gansler, a former undersecretary of defense for acquisition, who has been asked to review the project for the Defense Science Board.
15026	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"You think of it as, what do we need to do to protect the president?"
15030	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	They must be able to jam enemy radar, fend off incoming missiles and resist some of the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.
15035	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Why the cost has risen so much since the contract was signed with a team led by Lockheed Martin remains in dispute.
15039	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"And we can't figure out where that number comes from.
15042	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	"The Navy and industry team did not clearly realize the full implications of the White House requirements," John Young Jr., the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, said in a written response to questions.
15043	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	To meet those requirements and retrofit a commercial aircraft to Navy standards, he said, "the Navy and industry teams are having to complete substantial redesign" of the helicopter.
15045	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Vendrasco attributed the problems partly to an attempt to speed up the normal development process by three years.

15060	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	On Friday, for instance, Bush went to New York for an economic speech.
15062	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	At John F. Kennedy International Airport, another pair of helicopters waited to fly him into Manhattan.
15063	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Although the Marines maintain the craft with painstaking care, they occasionally break down.
15065	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	But the helicopter would not work, and they had to get off and take a car.
15073	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	The problems with the second batch have prompted the Pentagon to issue a stop-work order until it determines what to do and Congress provides more money.
15075	LTW_ENG_20080318.0026.LDC2009T13	Britain last year bought six standard EH-101 helicopters for about $57 million each -- roughly one-seventh of what it will cost the United States to buy the same aircraft and retrofit it for the president.

15081	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Mick Jagger would have, that's who.
15084	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	What "Shine a Light," Martin Scorsese's concert documentary, does beautifully is illuminate the way things are now with the self- described world's greatest rock 'n' roll band.
15086	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	But getting to that point turns out to have been a tougher slog than might be expected.
15089	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	This is especially the case with Jagger.
15090	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Yes, he can still run and jump with the best of them, but on camera, that movement plays like a practiced performance untouched by genuine emotion.
15094	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	Paradoxically, age is hardly a problem with Keith Richards.
15095	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	With his exceptional ability to lose himself in the music -- "I don't think on stage, I feel," he says at one point -- the Stones' guitarist looks like a wraith from another dimension, a being beyond both space and time.
15096	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	If the overall age of the group is a problem, "Shine a Light" has the resources to combat and overcome it, key among them being the amount of filmmaking craft and skill director Scorsese and his team bring to the proceedings.
15097	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	A meticulous planner and music aficionado who worked on "Woodstock" and whose credits include "The Last Waltz" and two excellent PBS music documentary series, Scorsese is also a film preservationist who seems to relish the task of conserving the almost retro nature of these concerts, shooting not in 3-D in massive soccer stadiums the way U2 did but in 35 millimeter in a relatively intimate Broadway theater.
15098	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	And although "Shine a Light" is largely a concert documentary, Scorsese has shrewdly included a smattering of other material, including the Cavett chat.
15105	LTW_ENG_20080404.0110.LDC2009T13	The Stones have been in any number of memorable films, including 1970's "Gimme Shelter" and Robert Frank's documentary with the unprintable name, but this outing is special, because of where it arrives and the obstacles it faced along the way.

15109	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	But Gurung is not a granny, or even a relative.
15111	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"To most elder Bhutanese, leaving your child here while you work is utterly mind-altering," said Gurung, as she lined up the children for their morning exercises under blossoming peach trees.
15112	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"But for our young, working parents, this is a wonderful lifeline."
15114	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	More Bhutanese are moving to cities and away from their extended families, traditionally a vital part of the social structure here.
15119	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It's one of the most challenging questions for the next generation: How do you modernize, but also remain Bhutanese?"
15120	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Sandwiched between China and India, the world's most populous nations, rugged, forested Bhutan is landlocked and has just 2.2 million people.

15129	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Fresh from elections last month that ended more than a century of royal rule, Bhutan is now a constitutional monarchy.
15130	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	It's struggling to do what many other countries have struggled to do: open up to the world while retaining its way of life.

15154	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Because the government is wary of permitting too much change too quickly, it has placed restrictions on day-care centers, licensing only those that watch children over the age of 3.
15156	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	Now, parents at Gurung's center are lobbying the government to allow day care for younger children.
15159	LTW_ENG_20080405.0047.LDC2009T13	"But we don't always want to completely copy the West.

15199	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Rotter sustained a concussion during the junior varsity football season, experienced lingering headaches that prompted him to leave the wrestling team and then endured another concussion playing lacrosse this spring.
15201	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Now Howard County schools can join other school districts that can make quantifiable decisions with the ImPACT (Immediate Post- Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) program, a tool to help track recovery from concussions.
15204	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Here's how it works: Before the season, an athlete takes the computerized ImPACT test, which, in part, measures his memory and reaction time after being shown a series of words, designs, patterns and symbols.
15205	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	It takes about 25 minutes.
15208	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"It definitely tests you," Rotter said.
15210	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Is there a lapse in memory?
15211	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Reaction time?
15212	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Some other decline in performance?
15218	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	To learn more about the ImPACT program, and to take the test ourselves, we caught up with Rotter, 16, and Hammond athletic trainer Tim Happel on Friday when Rotter was retaking the test for the second time since sustaining a concussion late last month.
15221	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	A person who sustains a concussion can be more vulnerable to concussion than those who have not sustained such an injury.
15224	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	When Rotter, who is enrolled in honors courses, is concussed, he suffers from headaches and a lack of concentration.
15225	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"It feels like you have a haze over you, a fog, kind of," he said, adding that his grade-point average dipped from about a 3.57 to a 2.71 in the fall when he had trouble focusing after his football concussion.
15228	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	He noticed further improvement Friday afternoon, taking it for a second time since his lacrosse concussion.
15229	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	But before clearing him to play, Happel wanted to consult with Gioia, who helped develop the concussion treatment program for Howard schools.
15234	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Mike Williams, coordinator of athletics for Howard schools, said that the county's dozen high schools have tested an average of about 200 athletes each.
15237	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	"Then it went to a week.
15238	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Now research shows that with high school students, their brains are still developing, and a sustained concussion in a high school student can impact their learning and development for a lifetime.
15240	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	It's not a perfect science, but it's the best thing out there."
15241	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	The cost of the program is $9,000 for the software, about $750 for each of Howard's 12 high schools.
15242	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	But for school systems without certified athletic trainers, administering and interpreting the tests could be a problem.
15244	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	For athletes itching to get back on the field, the ImPACT test can be friend or foe: friend if it raises no red flags, which might result in getting back sooner, or foe if the athlete feels fine -- or is downplaying symptoms, which is common -- but falls short of baseline benchmarks when retaking the test.
15246	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Not only could it be hazardous to your health, it could be embarrassing.
15247	LTW_ENG_20080424.0004.LDC2009T13	Gioia said the test has indicators that expose sandbaggers.

15255	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	According to reports his campaign committee filed with the Federal Election Commission, that put Craig's total legal tab at more than $407,000 since he was arrested June 11 at the Minneapolis-St.
15259	LTW_ENG_20080425.0040.LDC2009T13	Craig's office declined to comment.

15279	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	This week the gamble paid off, as Mr. Singh's government survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote.

15284	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	While those approvals are likely, they won't happen instantaneously.
15285	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	And because of the long August recess, there may not be more than 30 "legislative days" left before Congress adjourns on Sept. 26.

15295	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	To be sure, it is a risk.
15298	LTW_ENG_20080724.0012.LDC2009T13	But the fact that Mr. Singh successfully ditched the communists for the sake of closer ties with Washington is a hopeful sign that the agreement is already inducing moderation.

15333	LTW_ENG_20080803.0030.LDC2009T13	And the lawyer for the family of another victim, Bob Stevens, said they felt both vindicated at the apparent confirmation of their belief that a government biodefense worker was behind the attacks, and suspicious that Ivins might be a fall-guy in a bungled investigation.

15480	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	As the stock market plummeted on the news, McCain was forced to make a second and far more sober statement defending his work on the rescue plan.
15481	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"I worked hard to play a constructive role in bringing everyone to the table," he said to news reporters gathered at his next campaign stop, in Iowa.
15485	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	Although Barack Obama, who was campaigning in the suburbs of Denver, said no one person was at fault in the financial crisis and that there was a "lot of blame to spread around," he urged voters to consider McCain's record of favoring deregulation of the nation's financial markets as they weighed which candidate would best steer the nation's economic "ship into port."
15486	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"With so much at stake -- with our economy at risk, our children's future in the balance -- the greatest risk in this election is to repeat the same mistakes of the past," Obama said.
15487	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	"We can't take a chance on that same losing game."
15488	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	McCain also called for bipartisanship, yet he criticized his Democratic rival.
15490	LTW_ENG_20080930.0121.LDC2009T13	He continued: "Now is not the time to fix the blame

15573	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	What reads like a slight difference is a huge and profound change in practice.
15575	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Through this arrangement, as the young act on their environment to build their own survival and expressive capacities, they can imitate, identify with, and internalize the attitudes, values and life management styles of their meaningful caretakers.
15576	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Also, through this arrangement, caretakers can mediate the physical (including brain construction), psycho-emotional, moral- ethical, linguistic, cognitive-academic learning growth and development of children and students.
15577	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Most students from mainstream backgrounds -- regardless of their socioeconomic, racial or regional backgrounds -- experience this dynamic.
15578	LTW_ENG_20081018.0067.LDC2009T13	Children who do not come from mainstream backgrounds, or who have a non-mainstream experience, are more likely to be underdeveloped, or differently developed, and are less likely to be successful in school and in life.

15604	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The 12-seat option rejected Monday would have set aside seven minority seats on the council.

15608	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	Alaf noted that Christian, Yazidi or other minority politicians could increase their voices in Ninevah by running for office under the banner of large political blocs.
15609	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	That would guarantee them their guaranteed one-seat quota, plus more seats if they had enough public support, he said.
15610	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	"This does not limit their participation or prevent them from nominating themselves in any slate," he said.
15616	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	The deal must be approved by the nation's three-member presidency council, and Kana said he would demand a veto.
15618	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	That forced a re-negotiation of the law and led to the version passed in September and tweaked in Monday's voting.
15619	LTW_ENG_20081104.0088.LDC2009T13	There was no indication the Christians could force another veto, although their bitter objections raise the specter of heightened tensions in the north, which is currently the country's most violent region.

15642	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Which is precisely the challenge so many people face in their homes, particularly as they prepare for the onslaught of holiday parties and houseguests.
15643	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Russell uses his 1,100-square-foot apartment overlooking the rooftops of north Laguna Beach as an extension of the store.
15644	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	It's as minimalist and restrained as a Beverly Hills boutique.
15646	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Like his store, a stylish mix of affordable goods -- Pottery Barn shelves, West Elm bookcases and Crate &amp

15661	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Just 10 years ago, Russell was living in Florida and working in the hospitality business when he decided to make the move from restaurant to retail and head west.
15664	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	He spent his spare time as a power seller on eBay, marketing high-end fashion and holding trunk shows at home to recycle "hardly worn haute couture."
15665	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	Two years ago, he opened his version of a shop -- a gift boutique, he calls it -- in a former 1950s Volkswagen dealership.

15669	LTW_ENG_20081114.0034.LDC2009T13	On Saturdays, regulars know that mimosas and strawberries are served in the garden behind the store -- all the better to wander into his nearby annex -- two rooms beneath his apartment building that offer consignment clothing and Missoni linens.

16949	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	That includes advancing the 2008 presidential primary to Jan. 29 and using nearly $28-million in federal money to help 15 counties switch from touch screen machines to optical scan ballots with a verifiable paper trail.

16951	NYT_ENG_20070424.0311.LDC2009T13	The proposal was suggested by Hillsborough County's election supervisor Buddy Johnson.
16955	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	According to the evidence, revealed during the trial but made public for the first time, authorities had closely monitored meetings in 2004 between members of the two plots but never fully investigated the men who pulled off the transit attacks, which killed 56 people 18 months later.
16956	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	To ensure a fair trial, the judge had ordered the news media not to make the information public until after the verdict.
16958	NYT_ENG_20070430.0220.LDC2009T13	Within an hour of the verdict, the opposition Conservative Party and survivors and relatives of the victims of the transit attack demanded an investigation into why the authorities did not act on their surveillance.

16978	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	But what made him exceptional was that he acted as if his main motto were not "I am" or "I do" but "I serve."
16980	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	This inspiring self-denying quality is at the heart of Martin Duberman's new biography, "The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein."
16981	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	In one aside in parentheses Duberman remarks of Kirstein, "(never a truly rich man, he gave away a larger proportion of his total wealth than most patrons of the arts ever do)."
16983	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Duberman quietly marvels, as any reader must too, at how it was not enough for Kirstein in 1948 to forge the New York City Ballet, his life's single greatest project.
16984	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Despite the immense struggles of organization and fundraising that that task required, it also turns out that in 1948 Kirstein was busy in the art world: He organized an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (which he had served in many ways since its foundation) of sculpture by Elie Nadelman.
16986	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Kirstein had many other years as busy as that, and on just as many different fronts.
16988	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	For most of the first half of this book, however, Duberman seems too close to his research.

16990	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	But once Kirstein's plural worlds are all well defined, Duberman is driving in top gear.
16997	NYT_ENG_20070503.0117.LDC2009T13	Kirstein's tender affection for her is not in question, but Duberman lets us see Fidelma as a victim of Kirstein's driven nature and of the position of women in her generation.

17043	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	Now he plays and sings in a twangy trio that bears his name - the Avett Brothers, a band that exploits the tensions between the rustic Old South and the cosmopolitan New South, between rootsy bluegrass and rowdy punk rock, between reverence and irreverence.
17047	NYT_ENG_20070505.0116.LDC2009T13	"Sometimes," says Paul Lohr, the band's booking agent, "you have to throw caution to the wind and risk some sour notes and some out of tune strings or some completely broken strings to get those moments of brilliance."

17274	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	I know a Boston-area resident who is rooting for Ultimate Tease II.

17278	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Her reason for rooting against the Red Sox is simple.
17279	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	She was unable to buy the furniture at the time, and if the Red Sox win and it turns out that she could have had the furniture for nothing, she would be very upset with herself.
17282	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Nearly four months -- more than 100 games -- remain in the season, but had the Red Sox held on to their 5-4 lead, they might have driven a stake into the heart of the Evil Empire.
17285	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Guidry pitched -- brilliantly -- for the 1978 Yankees, who overcame a 14-game deficit, caught the Red Sox in September, beat them in a one-game playoff in October and went on to win the World Series for the second successive season.
17288	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Maybe the outcome of Sunday night's game will be immaterial -- the Yankees failed to build on their momentum by losing in Chicago on Monday night -- but a Red Sox victory could have delivered a mortal blow.
17291	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	Losing two games with Mike Mussina and Andy Pettitte pitching would have been especially discouraging.
17293	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	With 17 weeks left, the Yankees have to gain less than a game a week to catch the Red Sox.

17307	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	That 14-game deficit was now a three-and-a-half- game lead.
17311	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The 2007 clubhouse is already calm.
17314	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"You need to have the pitchers doing their job," Guidry said.
17315	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	"Right now, that's where we're weak."
17317	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	The Red Sox's pitching, meanwhile, may be too strong to allow losing streaks.
17318	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	But Guidry said after the Sunday night surprise: "This team still has character.
17319	NYT_ENG_20070605.0003.LDC2009T13	A game like tonight shows that."
17325	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"But it was no big deal.
17329	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez won't admit it had anything to do with a personal resurgence that already had begun in the days leading up to that game, but that seemed to hit full stride immediately thereafter.
17330	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	At this stage of his career, and with his 40th birthday looming later this summer, Gonzalez doesn't need personal affronts to get him going.
17331	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Thus, it must be a coincidence that in the 14games since that one, Gonzalez is batting .358 (19 for 58) with three of his eight home runs and eight of his 14 doubles.
17336	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	"We took a couple of photos afterward, just memories for me to put up in my home later on down the road.
17338	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I think the art of doubles has been lost the last 10 years, because everyone is more concerned with home runs.
17339	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	I have always thought doubles kept rallies going, but home runs pay more.
17344	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	The result has been what at worst could be described as a hot streak.
17350	NYT_ENG_20070612.0028.LDC2009T13	Gonzalez's first double drove in Russell Martin, slicing what had been a 3-0 Mets lead to 3-2 and continuing the all-too-rare rally that began with a walk by Juan Pierre, just his 10th in 280plate appearances.

17379	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	Routine use of X-rays caught on slowly in this country.
17382	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	The name of one, Dr. Richard Schatzki, is now attached to a circular narrowing of the esophagus -- a Schatzki ring -- that causes food to stick in the gullet of many patients.

17443	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	As X-ray technology improved, my father often replaced older machines with newer, larger and more powerful ones that produced better pictures.
17449	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	My father was curious about the causes of the medical problems he saw and sought ways to prevent them.
17451	NYT_ENG_20070618.0190.LDC2009T13	For example, he asked victims of automobile accidents about the model and color of the cars involved.

17986	NYT_ENG_20070909.0165.LDC2009T13	Stricker, the Madison, Wis., resident and an All-American at Illinois, served as the week's underdog story with a local twist.

18003	NYT_ENG_20070921.0187.LDC2009T13	Walid Jawad was tired of all the chatter on Middle Eastern blogs and Internet forums in praise of gory attacks carried out by the "noble resistance" in Iraq.

18073	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON - On Sunday evening, Anita Hill turned on the television at her Waltham, Mass., home to watch "60 Minutes."
18081	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill, now 51, said that when she heard about Thomas's book, she was reluctant to re-engage in the dispute that riveted the nation in 1991.
18083	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said she stands by her sworn testimony.
18084	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She said Thomas did make suggestive statements to her and talk about pornographic movies.
18085	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	She noted, as she did in 1991, that she took a polygraph test and passed it, while Thomas declined to be tested.
18087	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Moreover, Hill has not put the episode behind her, either.
18088	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	A few weeks ago, she began a sabbatical from her teaching job at Brandeis University, beginning a one-year stint as a visiting scholar at Wellesley College that will enable her for the first time to go through all of the 20,000 or so letters she received after testifying against Thomas.
18090	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	By studying the letters, she said, she hopes to find a deeper meaning in the turmoil that she and Thomas - and the country - experienced.
18091	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Now, the publication of Thomas's book, "My Grandfather's Son," has put Hill back in a place she thought she had left long ago - the national stage.
18092	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"What I found very surprising is this is a Supreme Court justice," Hill said.
18096	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Supporters of Thomas, meanwhile, welcome the possibility that the book may spark a reexamination of the Thomas-Hill clash.
18103	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	After Thomas was nominated for the Supreme Court, Hill told congressional investigators about the alleged harassment.
18107	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	But then he accepted a $1.5 million advance for the book, saying he was determined to set the record straight.
18108	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	In the book, Thomas wrote that a colleague asked him to hire Hill in 1981 even though she had told him that "I detest" Reagan.
18113	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	and "I hadn't realized her work had been so deficient."
18118	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill, asked about these accusations, responded, "I have no idea what he is talking about."
18125	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Hill said she has not considered suing Thomas over his statements.
18126	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	Thomas and Hill have not spoken to each other since before the hearings.
18131	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	"People say, 'Well, it is over now,"' Hill said.
18134	NYT_ENG_20071002.0152.LDC2009T13	I don't want to ignore it either."

18147	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	It's a strange hybrid.
18149	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	The tone changes when Thomas, fed up with liberal policies on race, accepts Ronald Reagan's invitation to run the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, becoming an object of contempt and derision for mainstream civil rights organizations.
18150	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas, recounting his years in government, adopts a defensive crouch, lashing out at his enemies, reopening old wounds and itemizing insults that should be forgotten.
18153	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Here, emotions get the better of him, as he portrays himself as a persecuted, almost Christlike figure singled out by the liberal establishment, at the behest of his civil rights enemies, not just for criticism but also for total annihilation.
18154	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	You wonder if, when writing these fiery chapters, Thomas recalled his own admiring words about his grandfather.
18156	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	In this respect Thomas is not his grandfather's son.
18161	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	As one of only two black students at his seminary school, Thomas experienced panic, followed by "a constant state of controlled anxiety."

18165	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	A fierce sense of discipline and a belief in hard work carried him from one academic triumph to another, culminating in a law degree from Yale, a university he grew to despise for reasons not altogether clear.
18166	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Along the way he grew an Afro and embraced radical politics.
18167	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"The more injustice I saw, the angrier I became, and the angrier I became, the more injustice I saw," he writes.
18168	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	What changed was his analysis of who was to blame.
18169	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Deeply disturbed by the court-ordered busing of black children to white schools, he came to the conclusion that liberal policies on race, especially welfare and affirmative action, were harming rather than helping blacks.
18170	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Thomas describes his intellectual journey, and his struggle to keep body and soul together on meager government pay, in some of the book's most absorbing and self-critical chapters.
18171	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	He regretted his early marriage, but for years could not bring himself to end the relationship and abandon his young son as his own father had.
18174	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	His finances were a shambles.
18179	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	This ideological shift set him on a collision course with traditional civil rights groups and, he argues, poisoned the atmosphere around his court appointment.
18181	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	Throughout his life Thomas has met adversity with angry defiance and iron resolve.
18187	NYT_ENG_20071009.0115.LDC2009T13	"Neither then nor at any other time did it occur to me that I could not do the work of a Supreme Court justice," he writes with characteristic aplomb.

18229	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	Hasselbeck is a far cry from the most prominent conservative women on the cable talk-show circuit, the ones who deal in slick sarcasm, publish books that vilify liberals ("Godless" and "Slander" both by Ann Coulter, "Unhinged" by Michelle Malkin) and take obvious pleasure in a claws-out fight.
18231	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	she's always outnumbered and usually outargued.
18232	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	But she has a prominent daily forum for her antiabortion, pro-war views - "The View" often reaches more than 3 million viewers each day.
18233	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	And Hasselbeck represents "an audience that the left just can't crack: traditional, God-fearing red state women, well-intended, who have made up their minds and won't hear it.
18235	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	To her like-minded fans, Felling said, Hasselbeck's lack of slickness is a strength.
18240	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	As Republicans struggle to connect with women and gird for a possible female Democratic nominee, Hasselbeck gives voice to a crucial set of voters, said longtime GOP consultant Frank Donatelli.

18267	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	For aspiring conservative pundits, she said, Hasselbeck represents new opportunities for exposure.
18268	NYT_ENG_20071024.0170.LDC2009T13	"It helps to have someone out there like that," Zanotti said, so talk-show hosts and rival guests "aren't always assuming that they're going up against Ann Coulter, that they're going up against Michelle Malkin.

18892	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	As the tiger cornered and attacked one of the brothers, four police officers arrived, distracted the animal and shot it dead.

18926	NYT_ENG_20071226.0223.LDC2009T13	Gittens said the officers did not want to shoot the animal while she was sitting next to the victim.

19733	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	and a visit by a vintage horse-drawn ambulance.
19734	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But the exhibition itself relies far less on country fair spectacle and far more on a provocative history of the ways in which humans and horses became, as the show says, "powerfully linked."
19735	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Those links may be as slight as fashions in clothing (trousers, we are told, developed specifically for the riding of horses) and as important as the fate of empires ("Next to God," Cortes is supposed to have said about the conquest of Mexico, "we owed our victory to the horses").
19737	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	(The 13th- and 14th-century Mongols, who held their immense empire together with the aid of the horse, also used hair from its tail to create the ancestor of the modern violin bow.)

19743	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The exhibition almost seems to suggest that this mythology touches on a deeper truth: The connection is so strong, we are all of us centaurs.
19745	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Horses, the show reminds us, "have cleared forests, plowed land, herded cattle and driven machines."
19748	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Now we are mainly aware of horses through the remnants of horse- inspired vocabulary, by the persistence of sports like polo, and, as a video shows, from ceremonies from around the world that use the horse to display power and grace.
19749	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But the show reminds us just how recent a phenomenon this diminution of importance is, and how difficult it is to think of any human activity untouched by the powers of the horse.
19752	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	A large number of horse species were "forest browsers" with three toes.
19753	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	But with the changes in climate about 35 million years ago, the predecessor of the modern horse became dominant, his two outer toes yielding to the single hoof, suited to the harder grasslands.
19755	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Instead of beginning in Africa and migrating to Europe, Asia and finally to the Americas, like mankind's ancestors, horses took just the opposite path: the majority of horse species began in the Americas.
19756	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Some 20 million years ago, three-toed horses crossed into Asia and then into Europe and Africa.
19757	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	About 10,000 years ago, horses became extinct in the Americas -- perhaps because of environmental change and overhunting -- which is one reason they had such a forceful impact when the Spanish took them back to the Americas, in conquest.
19758	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	That expansive family tree was pruned over time and not, it seems, by human forces.
19759	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	The show argues that all contemporary horses -- perhaps even the Asiatic wild horse, the Przewalski -- are part of a single species, Equus caballus.
19767	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	Horses were also "good partners": herd animals that could also show intense loyalties.

19786	NYT_ENG_20080515.0125.LDC2009T13	It's not a bad image for this presentation of the horse's history: it might seem a collection of ancient and random facts, but when brought together as smartly as it is, it almost comes to life, reminding us of the centaurs we all once were.

20035	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	The CR-V has become a class-leading favorite in this pack of smaller haulers, a group populated by some stiff competition -- Edmunds.com lists 26 of them, including the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester and Suzuki Grand Vitara -- and it's done so in quiet way, given that it's been around, in various forms, since it was introduced in 1996.
20038	NYT_ENG_20080818.0071.LDC2009T13	It was replaced in 2002 with a more substantial CR-V, but it looked as if the product planners did the whole inside, then realized they didn't have a place for the spare tire.

20208	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez deflected questions about the comment on Wednesday.
20209	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Ramirez has been labeled everything from high-maintenance to Terrell Owens in dreadlocks.
20211	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	That's what Ramirez has always done, since he was a rookie in Cleveland, since he was a $20 million man in Boston and since he became a cultural phenomenon in Los Angeles the past three months.
20214	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	So just scribbling his name in the lineup, whether he takes a swing or not, makes the Dodgers better.
20215	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	"I don't know about all that.
20216	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	I just know that I am happy here," said Ramirez, who walked through the bowels of Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday undisturbed and unrecognized in baggy jeans, a white pullover and music strumming in his ears.
20220	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	McCarver is the latest to contend Ramirez did just that in Boston in order to facilitate his exit.
20221	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	His last days in Boston were ugly.
20226	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	So potent is Ramirez that talk here Wednesday centered on what he won't do -- namely be given the opportunity to squash the Phillies.

20229	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	This Dodgers' lineup bears little resemblance to the one that slogged its way through much of the season.
20230	NYT_ENG_20081008.0179.LDC2009T13	Nomar Garciaparra, Jeff Kent, Andruw Jones, Juan Pierre and shortstops du jour are on the bench.

20247	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	MELBOURNE, Fla. - The giant, lumbering right whales that winter along Florida's coastline will soon be protected by a new federally imposed speed limit on large ships, a victory for environmentalists in a long-running struggle.
20249	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Some shipping industry representatives doubt the scientific studies underpinning the rule, which will lapse in five years if it is not renewed by federal regulators.
20251	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Environmental groups had asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a 30-mile slow-speed zone, but nevertheless hailed the new regulation.
20253	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"We're disappointed about some aspects of the rule, but it hasn't been so watered down that it won't be effective."
20255	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"While we have differences of opinion with NOAA on what the science says should be done to protect the right whales, the shipping industry respects their efforts and intentions with these new regulations," O'Hare said in an e-mailed response to the new agency rule.
20256	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Right whales, prized for their oil-rich blubber, were hunted nearly to extinction in the 1800s.
20257	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	The behemoths, which grow as large as 60 feet in length, were easy targets because of their slow movements, their preference for near-shore waters and the fact that their bodies floated after they were killed.
20259	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Along Florida's coast from Jacksonville to Palm Beach, beach- goers are sometimes delighted to spot the whales during winter months just a few dozen yards off the shoreline.
20265	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Protected by federal regulations for decades, the whales have still struggled to survive.
20266	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Between 1991 and 2002, 14 whales were confirmed victims of ship strikes, while 8 more died that way between 2002 and 2007.
20270	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Shippers say the new speed limits may cost them time and money while not being that effective.
20275	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	The federal rule allows an exception for ship captains to exceed the 10-knot limit if they deem it necessary for the safety of the vessel.
20277	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	Teams from Cornell University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have developed the devices, which listen for whale sounds with underwater hydro-phones and then relay the information by satellite, with the locations eventually passed on to ships.
20282	NYT_ENG_20081021.0051.LDC2009T13	"It doesn't substitute for aerial surveys," the method used for decades to locate the whales, said Vicki Cornish of the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group which pushed for the speed limits.

20390	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	With a market share so far this year of about 22 percent in the United States, GM is struggling with the costs of filling showrooms with eight separate brand lineups.
20391	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Cutting Saab and Hummer are no-brainers because each of them has 0.2 percent of market share, so they're irrelevant," said Jerome P. York, who was a member of GM's board during 2006.
20392	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	"Beyond that, Pontiac looks very suspect to me."
20393	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But shutting down a brand also is a complicated and costly effort that requires buying out dealers protected by state franchise laws, as well as scaling back production of vehicles.
20395	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	But the process took nearly four years and cost GM more than $1 billion.
20397	NYT_ENG_20081201.0134.LDC2009T13	GM, however, is spending down its cash hoard by $2 billion a month, and the company has acknowledged that it is teetering dangerously close to bankruptcy.

20463	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Several parents said that as stereotypes about the femininity of female athletes had faded, elite male athletes seemingly had become more eager to marry elite female athletes instead of say, models or cheerleaders.
20465	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"That's not why I married my husband, hoping to have good, athletic kids," Lois Willis said.
20469	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Her father once asked her, "What do you call somebody who overtrains?"

20475	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	She rejected scholarship offers from other colleges, wanting to play at Oklahoma because it was more highly regarded.
20480	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	Abi Olajuwon said she refrained from playing basketball until age 13 for that reason.
20481	NYT_ENG_20081204.0154.LDC2009T13	"There's always going to be someone to criticize and there's going to be that comparison," she said.

21854	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	In 2006 the boy did two things.
21855	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	One was quitting competitions to join the armed force, where he was supposed to "train soldiers how to shoot".
21861	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	As his coach Lloyd Woodhouse saw it, joining the army could put many ace shooters together for them to compare with each other and improve.
21862	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	"When you train alone, you can work really hard, but you don't know where your problems are," he said.
21865	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	Then Hancock said to himself, this is the girl I was looking for.
21873	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	During competitions, he did feel nervous, rubbing his sweating hands against his pants from time to time.
21877	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	The big boy well remembered he once pointed at the televised video clip of blockbuster "Hancock" to his wife.

21880	XIN_ENG_20080816.0437.LDC2009T13	In retrospect, no matter she agreed or not at that time, the remarks seemed more than a joke.
21885	XIN_ENG_20080818.0408.LDC2009T13	The Danes crossed the finish line in 7th place in the double points medal race, enough for them to claim gold with 61 points overall, and then had to survive a protest lodged by the Race Committee against them using another competitor's boat.
21887	XIN_ENG_20080818.0408.LDC2009T13	After a Jury hearing from Sunday afternoon till 00:50 on Monday and then continued in the morning, John Doerr, chair of the Jury panel that heard the hearing, confirmed shortly before midday that the protest had been dismissed and the provisional results were made official.

21922	XIN_ENG_20080902.0113.LDC2009T13	The president said among the regional projects that would receive priority attention, and moved to advanced stages of implementation during his tenure, were the ongoing regional infrastructure development master plans in roads, railways, inland waterways, ports and harbors as well as the Lake Victoria investments and development master plan.
