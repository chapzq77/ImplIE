103	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Can't you tell them I'm a veteran?"
107	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners have not been making it on an $860-a-month disability check from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
112	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Stand Together," a banner at a local cafe reminds Michelle.
113	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But since Troy came back from Iraq in 2003, the burden of war is now hers.
114	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle has spent hundreds of hours at the library researching complicated VA policies and disability regulations.
116	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She scavenges information where she can find it.
119	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Besides PTSD, Michelle suspects that Troy may have a brain injury, which could explain how a 38-year-old man who used to hunt and fish can lose himself in a three-day "Scooby-Doo" marathon on the Cartoon Network.

136	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His memory is shot, and he relies on Michelle for everything.
139	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle takes a breath.
142	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	(end ital)
144	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners live 80 miles from the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, where Troy receives his care, and sometimes they go once a week.
146	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"This is the part you don't see on TV," Michelle says.
148	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy recently screened positive for possible traumatic brain injury -- he was exposed to multiple blasts in Iraq -- and the hospital wants him back for more comprehensive testing.
151	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The cornfields and emerald hills spread out from the two- lane highway.
154	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is skeptical.
160	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A laconic country boy with a plug of tobacco in his cheek, Troy was a cavalry scout with the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment that pressed into Baghdad.
161	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	His platoon sergeant was decapitated by a rocket-propelled grenade, and others he knew were obliterated.
164	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He said he couldn't go back.
167	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Twice he tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized at Winn Army Community Hospital before being medically discharged for PTSD in 2004.
168	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	After 13 years in uniform, Troy got nearly the lowest disability rating possible, a $11,349 severance check and no benefits.
170	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She had visited him at Walter Reed.

174	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He imagined he saw Army vehicles on the interstate, causing him to shake and panic.
182	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now her full-time job is Troy.
184	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The concrete behemoth serves 129,000 vets from West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
185	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It is at once efficient and numbingly bureaucratic.
186	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle and Troy move down the hallways, passing a room near the PTSD residence where a group of young vets, some tattooed and still muscled from the desert, are playing a game of ring toss.
198	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She returns to the waiting room.
199	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A flier on the bulletin board catches her eye: "Coming Soon, Help for Veterans and Families."
201	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When Michelle emerges 15 minutes later, she stands alone in the waiting room, twisting the handle of her purse.
202	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The doctor said Troy is getting worse.
203	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Not knowing where else to go, Michelle heads upstairs to the PTSD offices.
204	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy has already done one 45-day stint in the residential program, and Michelle has been trying to get him in again.
211	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I apologize for not being able to get him in right away," he says.
214	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Anymore, he's just ashamed.
215	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	I wish I had a video camera set up to show the people at the VA: This is what an average day looks like."
216	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	She goes back for Troy, who has finished his tests.
217	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He is yawning and tired.
222	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Is there anything later than 8:30?"
223	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle asks, politely.
224	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"We have a three-hour drive."
226	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The appointment is for 20 minutes.
227	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The last stop of the afternoon is the travel reimbursement office on the first floor.
230	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	While a federal worker gets 48.5 cents per mile, a disabled veteran is still paid 11 cents a mile.
232	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	At the next window, $6 in government "deductibles" are taken out, bringing the grand total to $8.52.
237	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy was angry and embarrassed, but Michelle told him they had no other choice.
240	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He can't drive, he can't work, he can barely function without her.
241	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	A Black Hawk model set is next to his recliner, a therapeutic hobby made impossible by the shaking in his left arm.
242	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The house is small, and the blare of Nickelodeon from the TV chokes the day.
245	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The officer submits the right paperwork to have Troy re-evaluated.
246	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Doctors find that his condition has worsened and that his PTSD is "chronic and severe."
251	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	But instead of feeling exonerated, she feels sickened.
255	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	In the dreams he smells blood and burnt flesh and he hears bullets passing over his head.
259	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle goes page by page.
267	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Hearing loss.
274	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"They are saying your memory is extremely low," she says.
275	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"And here's another thing.
277	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Exposure to artillery and machine gun fire.' "
278	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	VA concludes that Troy's worsening condition merits an increase of his disability rating to 70 percent, raising his monthly check to $1,352 a month.
282	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"Even at 70 percent, you can't raise a family," she says.
285	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle is relieved.
288	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He doesn't want to go.
290	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	When the doctor asks if he has been having suicidal thoughts, he says yes.
293	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	On Sunday, he refuses to go back.
294	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	He says he has been through it before.
298	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Two weeks later, Troy has his first appointment.
299	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Whatever is discussed in the 60-minute session causes him to cry the next day.
300	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	The Turners decide to pack up and leave their $475-a-month rental house for a $450-a-month mobile home in Moorefield to save money and be near Troy's mother for help.
301	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	They are strained beyond belief.
303	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have PTSD, what's your excuse?"
304	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Troy kids Michelle.
305	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I have a husband with PTSD," she says.
306	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Before they leave, someone from Hampshire County's Heritage Days parade calls to see if Troy wants to ride on the veterans float.
308	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	It's not just the crowds.
310	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Michelle raises an eyebrow.
312	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"I think about that doctor down there," Troy says, referring to a psychologist at Fort Stewart who suggested he was faking it.
317	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	Now she looks at the man in the recliner.
318	LTW_ENG_20071015.0003.LDC2009T13	"It's people like you that made our country," Michelle says.
325	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I wouldn't say scared.
327	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	The arena section where American fans were sitting was revved up and hoping for more of Carr.

338	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	JaJuan Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, was playing tough defense on Carr, staying closer than arm's reach, and would not let him get another good look at the rim.
339	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Coach Pearl told me to go get him," Smith said.
341	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	I wasn't going to help anybody on defense, just stay on him."
342	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	When Carr hit his 3-pointer with six minutes left, drawing American to 50-49, Smith retaliated with a 3-pointer for Tennessee.
343	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a 3 down," Carr said.
344	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"And while we were making our run, they just played like the No. 2 seed and like a No. 1 team in the nation, and they made their runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead."
346	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Smith finished with 19 points to lead Tennessee.
347	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"Carr plays 40 minutes and Mercer plays 39," Pearl said, referring to American guard Derrick Mercer.
348	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	"I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we played a lot more guys than they did."
351	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	American played without Bryce Simon, a starting forward, who tore a knee ligament last week in the Patriot League tournament.

357	NYT_ENG_20080321.0174.LDC2009T13	Pearl, who shuffled his starting lineup for Friday's game, did not show any discouragement afterward.

390	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	People would feel totally overwhelmed and exhausted before they learned a thing."
391	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	That was then.
396	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Anyone who ventured into the Children's Museum before is familiar with the old building's shortcomings.
398	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then there were the high-traffic areas, made worse by a central staircase that funneled all activity through the center of the building.
399	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At times, the place felt like a cross between a rush hour subway car and a sold-out rock club.
400	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Double-wide strollers and kids running from exhibit to exhibit only complicated matters.
401	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The new building won't alleviate all these problems.
402	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But several key design features should help.
403	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Start with the front door, now given a proper place jutting out from the building fa?ade.
404	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Before, the entrance was harder to define, one of several doors, some locked, on the building's exterior wall, and leading to a cashier's area partially hidden by the central stairway.
406	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Founded in 1913 and housed in Jamaica Plain, the museum opened its current home in Fort Point Channel in 1979, renovating a 19th-century wool warehouse.
407	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Some 440,000 people pour through its doors annually, making it the fourth most attended museum in the region.
409	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	At the heart of the new Children's Museum is a glass-walled, rectangular expansion that, in a sense, has been placed in front of the taller, existing brick warehouse building.
411	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The ceiling rises three stories in the front atrium, before lowering - and adding a second floor - as you move farther into the building.
415	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Inside the existing space - the old warehouse - there are three floors for visitors.
417	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In total, the museum now takes up 105,000 square feet, just 10,000 square feet more than before.
418	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	How can an expanded museum be barely expanded?
419	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	It was an easy sell to the museum's board, given the institution's needs.
422	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Consider how the space is used.
423	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The fourth floor is now off limits to visitors, used mainly for offices.
426	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	You no longer have to walk through several activity areas - first reached through the now-removed central stairway - to get to your destination.
428	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Each gallery is accessible through the bridges.
429	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Not every children's museum has the luxury of worrying about the ease with which its visitors walk through the building.
430	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Smaller, newer museums still have to rely on the more-is-better maxim.
432	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"They also have more of a need to do that because their anticipated attendance numbers are very high."
434	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The KidPower section - in the glass-walled, new part of the building - will feature the tennis ball launcher and hand-pedaled bikes that move an exhibit sign up and down.
436	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	A new, three-story climbing structure replaces the old, two-story climb.
438	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	But what excites Gail Ringel, the museum's vice president of exhibits, is the 3,000-square-foot second floor space known as The Common.
439	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Most days, it will feature a maze, musical chairs, and a giant chess game.
443	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	"We hosted significant performances from area artists, dancers, and musicians in there, and it was a serious impediment to flow in the museum.
444	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	The Common is going to be a very important space.
446	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Then when we're having our large festival days, the exhibits can be swept out."
448	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	In Philadelphia, the Touch Me Museum is constructing an $88 million building set to open next year.
458	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	When the expanded Children's Museum reopens on April 14, there will be a little of the old, and a little of the new.
459	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Here are a few familiar exhibitions, and a few potentially exciting new stops.
461	NYT_ENG_20070402.0104.LDC2009T13	Raceways, perhaps better known as "that place with all the golf balls and ramps," has been rebuilt near the new front door, meant to send a signal to children that the building might look different, but it's still their children's museum.

824	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Darren Clarke sank a huge birdie putt on the final hole to win the BMW Asian Open here on Sunday for a highly emotional victory that he dedicated to his sons following the death of their mother.The Northern Irishman pumped both fists into the air in triumph and embraced his caddie after his putt of around 30 feet on the 18th hole gave him a one shot victory over playing partner Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands.
825	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It was Clarke's first tournament win since his wife, Heather, died of cancer in August 2006.
827	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke carded a one-over 73 to finish the tournament at eight under, while Derksen also shot a 73 following a dramatic final few holes in which the Ulsterman gave up a two-stroke cushion as his thoughts drifted to his family.
831	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	Clarke's victory, which earned him 383,000 dollars, was his first win on the European Tour since 2003 and his 11th in total.
832	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	He said it was the most important victory of his career as it cemented his golfing comeback following his wife's death.
834	AFP_ENG_20080427.0269.LDC2009T13	It's not easy to see through," Clarke said as he spoke of the deep emotional turmoil he has endured since his wife died.

862	APW_ENG_20080730.0965.LDC2009T13	The airline said it had drawn up a special schedule for German and European routes for the next five days that calls for about 90 percent of flights to take off.

1024	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Practitioners acknowledge that their predictions, however intriguing, become more theoretical when pushed far into the future, as with advanced weather forecasts.

1037	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	"Fifty million is fairly straightforward," said Christopher R. Scotese, a geologist at the University of Texas, Arlington, who has pioneered the predictions in recent years.

1045	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The theory, named for the Greek word "tekton," or builder, is a study in slowness.
1051	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1970, Robert S. Dietz, who uncovered major clues to plate movement in the deep sea, wrote a Scientific American article on the breakup of Pangea.
1052	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	He also took a first step toward predicting the future, sketched out plausible continental shifts for the next 50 million years, and projected their local repercussions.
1055	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Ten million years from now, Dietz wrote, "Los Angeles will be abreast of San Francisco."
1056	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And in another 50 million years, he added, Los Angeles will have moved up the west coast into Alaskan waters.
1060	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	And he toyed with their future shapes.
1062	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	In 1982, Scotese got a call from Discover magazine asking if he would consider a bigger project: envisioning Earth not 50 million years from now but 200 million.
1064	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	he recalled.
1066	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The effort forced him to think beyond simple extrapolations and formulate rules that could govern the onset of major tectonic events, like the formation of subduction zones, deep ocean trenches that gobble up seafloor and tear continents apart.
1069	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Teachers use his animations, and his site has won scientific awards.

1071	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Today, some of his most ambitious efforts center on envisioning how Earth might look 250 million years from now.
1073	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Their masses might change shape but seldom disappear altogether because their bedrock weighs little compared with dense ocean crust.
1074	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Continents literally float above the action.
1075	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	So do mountains.
1077	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The difficult part, he said, is predicting the development of new subduction zones in the seabed, and in comprehending how aggressively they rearrange the land.
1084	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Then -- 25 million to 75 million years from now -- Australia moves north, slamming into Indonesia and Malaysia before pirouetting counterclockwise to smash into the Philippines and then Asia, eventually merging with it.
1085	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Antarctica also moves north, shedding its icecap.
1087	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	The Indian Ocean becomes a virtual inland sea.
1089	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some 200 million years from now, the closure forces Newfoundland to smash into Africa and, a bit later, Brazil to ram into South Africa.

1097	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	They do so, geologists say, in two very dissimilar ways.
1098	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	As Scotese envisioned, they can break apart and reverse course to merge again.
1099	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Or they can move apart until their paths around the planet cause them to coalesce on the far side.
1102	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Some forecasters see the current expansion -- with no course reversal -- as dominating the remainder of this tectonic cycle.
1104	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	Sergei A. Pisarevsky, a geologist at the Tectonics Special Research Center of the University of Western Australia, calls the resulting supercontinent "Amasia."
1105	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	But he said his vision bore no special likelihood of coming true.
1107	NYT_ENG_20070108.0110.LDC2009T13	J. Brendan Murphy, a specialist on tectonic cycles at St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, echoed that view.

1411	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	As the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali is running into the second week of negotiations, the various contact groups are intensifying efforts to maximize progress before the arrival of Ministers for the High-Level segment that starts on Wednesday.
1413	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	One of the areas of visible disagreement at the Bali Conference is the need for quantified national emission targets for industrialized countries -- guided by the range of 25-40 percent reductions by 2020 -- and the need for emissions to peak in the next 10-15 years.
1415	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The European Union (EU) has suggested that a roadmap would require a "long-term" vision and that includes setting such a target.
1416	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	The United States, however, has maintained that the Bali document should not contain targets or any other goals that would "prejudge" the outcome of the negotiations.
1420	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The decision on the GEF as the Secretariat and the World Bank as trustee was widely expected, although the reference to this as an interim arrangement up for review every three years was a surprise to me," says one observer.
1422	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Parties also acknowledged the need to strengthen existing commitments and enhance their implementation, especially with regard to developing countries.
1423	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, delegates continued on Tuesday discussions over the Co-Facilitators '"non-paper"on the Convention track distributed later on Saturday.
1424	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap.
1426	XIN_ENG_20071211.0110.LDC2009T13	"The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday," warns a delegate.
1432	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	The Partnership for Public Service report found that orientation programs typically concentrate on administrative matters such as filling out paperwork.
1433	LTW_ENG_20080514.0104.LDC2009T13	What's needed, it said, is a more comprehensive approach that involves teaching new employees about the agency's mission and culture, including how employees relate to each other and to outside groups, how collaborative the workplace is, and how performance is rewarded.

1475	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	In January she loaned her campaign $5 million, nearly half of her contribution to the family till, saying she had used "my money."
1481	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The couple donated an additional $240,000 to charity last year, according to the Obama campaign.
1482	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	The Clintons "made charitable contributions at a higher rate than taxpayers at their income level," said spokesman Jay Carson in a swipe at Obama.
1484	LTW_ENG_20080405.0119.LDC2009T13	Since 2002, for example, the Clintons have given two or more loans of indeterminate value to unspecified "relatives" with no evidence they were ever repaid.

1531	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	For years, Joshua Sharfstein shuddered whenever he walked down a drugstore aisle lined with cough and cold products for babies and toddlers.
1533	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"Kids with colds were getting these medicines that had never been shown to be either effective or safe."
1534	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	So when Sharfstein became Baltimore's health commissioner he launched a campaign that led an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration to conclude last week that the products should not be used in children younger than 6, shocking many parents and setting up a possible clash between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is vowing to continue selling the products.
1540	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But several experts noted that about two-thirds of prescription drugs had never been studied in children.
1541	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"There are a huge number of drugs that are regularly given to children that have never been tested in children," Michael Shannon, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
1542	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"I'm very concerned many of these agents may also be inappropriate for children."
1543	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"It really is unbelievable," said Peter Lurie of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer group.
1547	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Once the FDA got that power in 1962, the agency began systematically reviewing broad classes of products.
1548	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They had a massive job involving hundreds of products and hundreds of ingredients," said William Schultz, a former FDA deputy commissioner.
1549	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"They gave priority to prescription drugs, for understandable reasons.
1551	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The agency did, however, organize a panel of experts in 1972 to review nonprescription cough and cold medicines, which concluded there was enough evidence to endorse 35 of the 92 ingredients in products.
1552	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	But the recommendation was based on studies in adults.
1554	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"At that point in time, it was felt that was the best level of evidence we could have," said Marsha Rappley, a professor of pediatrics at Michigan State University who co-chaired last week's panel.
1563	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	If you are a desperate parent at 10 or 11 o'clock at night on a Saturday and your kid has a cold what do you do?
1564	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	You go to the drugstore and see all this stuff on the shelves with pictures of babies and assume it must work," said Wayne Snodgrass, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who co- signed Sharfstein's petition.
1568	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"You can justify the argument that doctors can make up their own minds, but that's a much harder argument to make for parents, who have never seen any of these studies."
1569	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Some experts defend the medical groups, saying policy statements from doctor groups can only do so much, especially against the aggressive marketing by large pharmaceutical companies, which spend more than $50 million a year to sell the products.
1570	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	"For the past 25 or 30 years we've been warning about violence on TV," said Snodgrass, who also chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on drugs.
1576	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Where was the FDA in this?"
1584	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	Officials at agency said they acted quickly on Sharfstein's petition because they had become alarmed by the studies questioning the cold products' effectiveness and mounting reports of possible dangers.
1585	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported in January, for example, that more than 1,500 children, including three who died, had suffered adverse reactions to the medications in 2004 and 2005, .
1587	LTW_ENG_20071026.0132.LDC2009T13	In the meantime, the agency, which stresses that any adverse reactions are relatively rare, might offer advice to parents, officials said, and planned to work with the drugmakers to organize studies of the products.

2073	AFP_ENG_20070224.0397.LDC2009T13	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday dismissed the upcoming Latin American tour of his US nemesis George W. Bush as a "diplomatic offensive" that is doomed to fail.

2226	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON
2227	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Vice President Cheney personally orchestrated his office's 2003 efforts to rebut claims that the administration used flawed intelligence to justify the war in Iraq and discredit a critic who he believed was making him look foolish, according to testimony and evidence Thursday in the criminal trial of his former chief of staff.
2228	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney dictated talking points for a White House briefing in the midst of the controversy that summer, his former press aide, Cathie Martin, testified, stressing that the CIA never told him that a CIA-sponsored mission had found no real evidence that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Africa.
2230	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	In the dramatic replay of events that summer that unfolded Thursday in Libby's federal court trial, Cheney was portrayed as a general on a political battlefield -- enmeshed in tactics, but also deputizing his chief of staff to handle the dirty job of persuading journalists that his war critic was all wrong.
2231	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Previously described in court filings and by the media, Cheney's role was brought to life Thursday by Martin's account.
2232	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She is the first witness in the case who worked closely with Cheney and Libby as they tried to refute former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was sent to Niger by the CIA to determine whether Iraq had sought uranium for a weapons program.
2235	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Libby, 56, is charged with lying to investigators and a grand jury about how the identity of Wilson's wife, CIA officer Valerie Plame, was leaked to the media days after Wilson went public with his claims that the administration had twisted his findings to justify the war in Iraq.
2237	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	He is not charged with the leak itself.
2238	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin recalled telling Cheney and Libby information from CIA spokesman William Harlow that Wilson was the person sent to Niger ``and his wife works for the CIA.''
2239	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin is the fourth witness from the administration to contest Libby's claim that he learned Plame's name from NBC's Tim Russert.
2243	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Cheney told Martin to alert the media that a highly classified and recent National Intelligence Estimate indicated no doubts about Iraq's efforts to buy uranium.
2247	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin, who now works on communication issues for the president, said Libby also directed her to ask the CIA which journalists were preparing stories about Wilson's Africa trip, then personally telephoned at least one in an attempt to influence the broadcast.
2252	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	Martin portrayed both Libby and Cheney as concerned that reporters were not telephoning their office directly to get their side of the story about Wilson and his criticism of the administration.
2253	LTW_ENG_20070126.0127.LDC2009T13	She said they directed her and her staff to begin monitoring television reports on the Niger trip and provide daily transcripts along with their usual canvas of printed stories about the vice president's office.
2266	AFP_ENG_20070710.0357.LDC2009T13	"If you can now take out insurance against dangerous behaviour, it is a serious attack against the road safety which has already seen a negative development due to the increased number of speeding offenses," Council official Jesper Soelund told Urban.
2270	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The amounts that contenders can bring in will shape the narrative of the race for months to come -- potentially vaulting a candidate into the top tier -- and could spell an early exit for some.
2272	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., for example, mingled with about a thousand donors Tuesday night at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel for her campaign's second million-dollar-plus fundraiser in three days.
2273	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	It is not simply Clinton's outsize fundraising power driving the vacuum-cleaner mentality.
2276	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The result: More than a year and a half before the election, the collective field could match in a single quarter the nearly $100 million that George W. Bush raised during his record-breaking primary effort two presidential cycles ago.
2279	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Estimates of what Clinton will raise this quarter range from $15 million (the official prediction of the campaign, but one her own aides privately concede is low) to $50 million (a staggering and probably unrealistic figure).
2281	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	But there is ample evidence -- such as Obama's raising $1.3 million at a single Hollywood event -- to suggest that he could do better, perhaps hitting $20 million or higher.
2283	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton and Obama (as well as Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas) must pay at least some attention to their positions in the Senate, but Edwards is unencumbered by a day job and is still riding his popularity as the vice presidential nominee in 2004.
2284	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He has by all accounts been on a furious, if quiet, fundraising tear, hoping to at least match the $7.4 million he raised in the first quarter of 2003 -- a number that at the time led all contenders and vaulted him into serious contention.
2286	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``It's a contest of elimination,'' said Fred Baron, Edwards' national finance chair.
2288	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Alan Solomont, chairman of Obama's fundraising effort in New England, described the campaign's fundraising venture as a ``start-up'' that has required building from the ground up in a short time.
2291	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	His supporters say the strategy is working.
2292	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``I had thought, `Boy, this is going to be quite an effort,' not knowing how to raise money or who to even turn to, and within a couple weeks' time we had more than quadrupled my expectations in terms of what we would raise,'' said Dan Nova, 45, a first-time presidential fundraiser who held the breakfast event at his house.
2298	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	In the last election cycle, Blue State Digital helped former Vermont governor Howard Dean bring in a flood of low-dollar online donations that catapulted him into the spotlight.
2299	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Clinton, who can roll over more than $11 million from her Senate race last year, has a huge, traditional network in place -- headed by the veteran Clinton finance guru, Terence McAuliffe -- and her husband, perhaps the party's biggest fundraising draw.
2301	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	he also attended Tuesday night's event (minimum donation: $1,000) at the Marriott Wardman Park.
2303	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Just as she is exceeding expectations everywhere she is going politically, we'd all like to exceed expectations when it comes to fundraising,'' said Steve Grossman, a major Clinton fundraiser in Boston.
2304	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	He said Hillary Clinton, like Obama, is bringing in new donors every day.
2305	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	After an intimate ``friend-raising'' dinner at the home of Elaine and Gerry Schuster in Boston in February, Clinton supporters are preparing for a much larger gathering on March 30 -- just under the wire for first-quarter filing.
2306	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	The campaign has asked donors to send checks in advance so they can be applied to the March 31 tally.
2307	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Both Clinton and Obama are expected to hold fundraisers in Las Vegas later this week.
2312	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	``Either he's gotten all the money he's going to get or they've got so much money they don't need any more,'' the strategist said.
2314	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Romney, refused to offer a concrete goal for the quarter, adding: ``Everybody recognizes that fundraising totals should be reflective of the national polls.
2317	LTW_ENG_20070321.0111.LDC2009T13	One Republican operative said that Paul Singer, a pioneer in hedge-fund investing and a Giuliani backer, is personally making calls to potential donors in New York and Washington, putting his own capital on the line to round up cash.

3266	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Roughly 2,000 times over the past 17 years, Marguerita Toribio, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, has climbed into a cushioned recliner for the three-hour dialysis treatment that keeps her alive.
3268	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	U.S. taxpayers have covered the entire cost of her treatment in California: more than $500,000 and rising, not including a kidney transplant in 1993.
3269	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The kidney failed when Toribio briefly moved to North Carolina, which refused to pay for her anti-rejection drugs.
3271	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The best a social worker could offer was a prepaid plane ticket back to California.
3272	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"When I came back here, I said, `There is no way I'm leaving for another state again,' " said Toribio, now 29, before a technician poked two needles into her arm at the St. Joseph Hospital dialysis center in Orange, Calif.
3284	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But officials in California, New York and a few other states figure that not treating patients whose kidneys are failing costs more.
3286	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	At that point, federal law requires that they receive dialysis until they are stable enough to be released -- usually only to deteriorate again within weeks and return to the ER.

3295	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Others see free health care as a de facto endorsement of their presence.
3303	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It failed.
3305	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	"We do not pay for chronic care for illegal immigrants," Mary Kahn, a Medicaid spokesperson, said when asked about the issue in early 2007.
3309	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Many states, including Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, take the position that kidney failure does not automatically qualify as an emergency because patients can survive for weeks without dialysis before toxins accumulate to fatal levels.
3315	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	A group of illegal immigrants sued Arizona in 2002 after the state attempted to cut off their dialysis.
3316	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Heeding arguments that sporadic emergency treatments would jeopardize lives, a judge told the state to keep treating them while the case was decided.
3318	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	California's dialysis policy is largely an economic calculation, said Stan Rosenstein, the administrator of Medi-Cal, the state health-care program for the poor that covers dialysis for illegal immigrants.
3325	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Teresita Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines, hadn't intended to stay in the United States, but being rushed to the emergency room with kidney failure eight years ago changed her mind.
3329	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Social workers and doctors in Texas and other states said patients might be vaguely aware of the services in California, but they are often too sick to move by the time they understand the gravity of their plight.
3331	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Some hospitals in Texas quietly encourage illegal immigrants to move to Houston, where the public hospital district uses local taxes to pay for routine dialysis even though the state Medicaid program does not.
3332	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Dr. Karla Vital, a kidney specialist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, said her hospital encourages Mexican nationals to return to Mexico.

3336	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Delia Lopez, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant who recently started dialysis in Los Angeles, said she would rather be with family in Mexico.
3339	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	The only alternative to dialysis is a kidney transplant, a procedure California and a few other states provide to illegal immigrants.
3340	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Last year, 52 of the 1,912 kidney transplants in California were for illegal immigrants.
3342	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Critics, however, say that dipping into the organ pool is a greater outrage because so many citizens are waiting.
3344	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	Toribio is now seeking a second transplant.
3346	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	But Toribio, who works in a textile factory for $8 an hour attaching tags to blankets, towels and bathmats, believes the United States should accept it as the price of a cheap labor pool.
3347	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	As much as she would like to visit her parents and grandparents in Mexico, she has never returned.
3348	LTW_ENG_20081031.0044.LDC2009T13	It is not worth the risk of leaving California: She might not be able to get back.

3365	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz obliquely referred to the powerful new rivals in an afternoon question-and-answer session with reporters.

3370	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	It's a character test," he said.
3371	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"But it's not about the economy.
3372	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	We don't want to use that as an excuse.
3373	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	And it's not about the competition.
3374	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Don't believe the media hype.
3377	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	"We somehow evolved from a culture of entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation to a culture of, in a way, mediocrity and bureaucracy," Schultz said.
3378	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	His remarks combined self-criticism with musings on the turbulent economy, which he noted was reducing traffic to Starbucks stores.
3380	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz said several times that the economy looked grim for the rest of the year, particularly in regions of the country hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis.
3381	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Starbucks has also suffered from rising wholesale prices for coffee and dairy products.
3382	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the face of those pressures, Schultz returned as chief executive 11 weeks ago.
3383	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	He quickly announced 600 layoffs and the closing of 100 of the least profitable Starbucks stores in the United States.
3390	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Schultz called the new blend "a coffee so fresh that those people who drink it with milk and sugar will want to drink it black because of the sweetness."
3394	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Looking further ahead, Schultz said that the company planned to introduce health- and wellness-related food and drinks and energy beverages later in the year.
3395	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	Wednesday's meeting represents what Schultz hopes will be a striking turnaround in the speed and spirit of innovation at Starbucks.
3396	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the first half of the decade, the company thrived on product introductions like the Frappuccino, a frozen coffee drink.
3397	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The last innovation widely thought to be successful was the Cinnamon Dolce Latte -- in early 2006.
3401	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	The company then tried to create efficiencies among stores, adding technology like massive automated espresso machines, which have little of the romance or aroma of the old hand-operated machines.
3402	NYT_ENG_20080319.0200.LDC2009T13	In the second half of last year, Starbucks' same-store sales -- a significant number watched by Wall Street -- declined for the first time.

3456	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	The UN envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari proposes independence for the Albanian- populated Serbian province in his confidential report, excerpts of which were quoted by the French newspaper Le Monde on Tuesday.
3458	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	According to Le Monde, Ahtisaari wrote that "maintaining an international administration was not tenable" for Kosovo but that its "reintegration into Serbia was not a viable option."
3461	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	"It's also the only chance for a sustainable partnership with Serbia."
3465	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	Some 10,000 ethnic Albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict.

3468	AFP_ENG_20070320.0189.LDC2009T13	The UN Security Council will be asked in the coming weeks to consider the plan put forward by Ahtisaari following the failure of negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo Albanians.

3601	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	The company did not mention a dispute with Mexico's largest brewer Grupo Modelo -- which was 50-percent owned by Anheuser- Busch.
3602	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	Grupo Modelo filed a notice of arbitration against Anheuser-Busch last month, saying the takeover violated their investment agreement and its right of consent to enter into a partnership with InBev.
3608	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev said it now had all the regulatory clearances it needed for the deal.

3620	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev says the company is well positioned to cope with a slowing global economy because costs for key ingredients such as grain malt for brewing beer and aluminum for beer cans will fall even as sales stall.
3621	APW_ENG_20081118.1030.LDC2009T13	InBev is renowned for shaving costs since it was formed in a 2004 merger between Belgium's Interbrew and Brazil-based AmBev.

4714	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There was a time when the Episcopal Church in the United States was known as "the Republican Party at prayer," but in the last 30 years it has evolved into the Rainbow Coalition of Christianity.

4719	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	The communique even specified a deadline: Sept. 30.

4741	NYT_ENG_20070220.0216.LDC2009T13	There are many bishops who have not formally authorized ceremonial rites for gay unions, but who nevertheless allow priests to perform them.

5531	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	LOS ANGELES 2008-01-17 01:28:51 UTC
5532	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Conservationists criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's decision to exempt the Navy from an environmental law so it can continue using high-power sonar in its training off California -- a practice they say harms whales and other marine mammals.
5534	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been expected to decide the future of the Navy exercises on Friday.
5535	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	However, late Wednesday, the appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Court to consider first.
5536	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The White House said Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East.
5537	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the paramount interest of the United States" and its national security.
5540	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	"It's typical for this Republican administration to ignore environmental protections under the banner of fear."
5542	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	Sonar may also mask the echoes some whales and dolphins listen for when they use their own natural sonar to locate food.
5544	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction this month requiring the Navy to create a 12-nautical-mile, no-sonar zone along the Southern California coast and to post trained lookouts to watch for marine mammals before and during exercises.
5546	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	The court found that using mid-frequency active sonar violated the Coastal Zone Management Act, but Bush exempted the Navy from a section of that act.
5549	APW_ENG_20080117.0097.LDC2009T13	For example, the sound can hurt some species while not affecting others, and experts do not fully understand why.

5679	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats announced Wednesday they would all but surrender to President George W. Bush's demand that lawmakers appropriate no more than $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) for annual operating expenses for Cabinet departments whose budgets are set each year by Congress.
5680	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Democrats hoped to make an exception for a $3.7 billion (euro2.5 billion) increase for veterans health care, calculating that Bush and his Republican allies in Congress would relent in the case of the politically sacrosanct program.
5682	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	Differences over Iraq and whether to cut back lawmakers' hometown projects are among issues still to be resolved.
5686	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The White House does not believe the additional veterans money is needed and previously has issued veto threats if the money for veterans is not accompanied by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
5688	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	But with the White House playing such a strong hand in the negotiations, Boehner now insists Democrats stick within the president's $933 billion (euro635.4 billion) figure, with exceptions for border security and a few other "emergencies."
5690	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	The bill will not carry Iraq aid when passing the House next week, though Democrats have said they will attach about $30 billion (euro20.4 billion) for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and some domestic Pentagon needs.
5693	APW_ENG_20071213.0515.LDC2009T13	More recently, Democrats worked with pragmatic appropriations panel Republicans such as Sen. Thad Cochran and Rep. James Walsh to craft a split-the-differences bill cutting $11 billion (euro7.4 billion) from the earlier Democratic measures.

5719	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	The ads, running on Spanish-language television and radio in states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico, feature Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain pointing fingers at each other for not having done enough on immigration.
5720	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	McCain launched the opening salvo by blaming Obama for the collapse of last year's controversial Senate bill seeking to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
5723	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Though the ads mostly dish out criticism and fall short of offering solutions to the immigration problem, it's no coincidence they're being offered only on Spanish-language airwaves, experts said.
5725	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	"Immigration has been complicated, heated and polarizing," explained Audrey Singer, immigration policy analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. "Definitely not what you want to talk about in the last couple of weeks of the election."
5726	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	By keeping the discussion limited to Spanish, both candidates have found they could seek crucial Hispanic votes while keeping the issue under the mainstream radar, said Federico Subervi, who teaches journalism and mass communication at Texas State University in San Marcos.
5727	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	It's niche political advertising taken to a higher strategic level because it's only in Spanish, noted Subervi, director of the university's Center for the Study of Latino Media and Markets.

5731	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Federico de Jesus, spokesman for Obama, said McCain started it all by issuing Spanish ads smearing Obama's record on immigration -- and the Obama camp was forced to respond in kind.
5735	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Although the tit-for-tat continues on or off the air, in Spanish and English, both campaigns agree on one point: Neither is pandering to Latinos as a one-issue voting bloc.
5736	NYT_ENG_20081017.0103.LDC2009T13	Their views on the economy, health care, education and national security are just as important, de Jesus and Fernandez said.

6019	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	And federal officials say the fund, financed by a federal tax on gasoline, is careening toward a deficit within two years.
6021	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Higher construction costs, congressional overspending and an aging highway system are also putting a growing strain on it.
6026	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the commission began a two-day hearing with California transit officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's downtown Los Angeles office to discuss the region's needs.
6029	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Some in the Congressional Budget Office believe the deficit will be even more substantial, possibly $3 billion to $4 billion.
6030	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The second portion of the fund -- used to finance mass-transit projects with 20 percent of the federal gas tax collected -- is not expected to go into deficit.
6031	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Field hearings on the fund quietly began in November in New York and Memphis, where the commission started to measure the nation's transportation needs.
6032	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Hearings in L.A. are taking place simultaneously with ones in Atlanta.
6035	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Brian Turmail, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said commissioners are asking why all the increased spending on road projects isn't paying off.
6038	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"What we're spending isn't really getting the results we want," he said.
6039	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	But Peters said funding also is a problem as Congress overspends its means, and revenue for the Highway Trust Fund has slowed as more alternative-fuel cars have hit the road.
6040	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	People also aren't driving as much as they once did, she said.
6042	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	A report commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that the fund would run out of money.
6044	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said hybrids account for just a fraction of the car market and could not be playing a significant role in the decline of the Highway Trust Fund.
6047	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"All vehicles are improving their gasoline mileage," Taylor said.
6049	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Blaming fuel-efficient cars for the decline of money in the fund is a distortion of reality, he said.
6050	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"There are still a lot of people out there who bought big pickup trucks and are driving them at a rapid rate of speed," he said.
6051	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	At the same time, the price of construction has increased far quicker than inflation, partly driven by a development boom in China that has driven up the price of raw materials such as cement and steel, said Dan Beal, managing director of public policy for the Automobile Club of Southern California.
6053	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	The first is to increase the number of toll roads and raise toll prices during rush hour.
6055	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	There already is a pilot project on that option in Oregon, but it's not clear how that might affect how much the average driver would pay.
6056	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	Ultimately, whatever solution public officials adopt will have to involve persuading drivers that they are getting good value for their tax dollars, Beal said.
6057	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"The public has to be convinced that what they're paying now is being used appropriately and wisely," he said.
6058	NYT_ENG_20070222.0015.LDC2009T13	"Nobody wants to pay more if they don't think they're getting value for what they're currently paying."

6084	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	The studies were presented on Saturday here at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, where the nation's cancer doctors usually discuss the latest in chemotherapy and new biotechnology drugs.
6086	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	They acknowledge that many of their patients are taking these supplements -- widely available in health food stores -- and asking them about them.
6087	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	So, they said, well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine whether these approaches are helpful or harmful.
6088	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"One of the most common questions patients ask me is about these things they have snookered away in their purses and pocketbooks," said Dr. Bruce Cheson, a hematologist at Georgetown University, who moderated a news conference on the studies of the therapies.

6111	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	"The theory is ginseng would help the body moderate the negative things going on," she said.
6115	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Previous studies had shown the benefit of preventive radiation therapy to the head for patients whose tumors were concentrated in a small area.
6116	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	But the new study showed the technique was helpful for patients whose tumor had spread further into the lung or elsewhere in the body.
6117	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Only 14.6 percent of those who got the head radiation had symptoms from a spread of cancer to the brain a year later.
6120	NYT_ENG_20070602.0129.LDC2009T13	Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung cancer specialist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the study, said the findings would "change the standard of care almost immediately."

6174	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Joyandet stressed that the moment is right for the country "to consolidate its waning presence" in the African continent.
6175	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"This is not the time to leave Africa" because "the time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa is now," Joyandet was quoted as telling reporters shortly after arriving in Dakar on Friday.
6177	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	There are a number of countries that were not interested in Africa, but who are now beginning to show keen interest," said Joyandet, who is in the Senegalese capital for an official visit.
6178	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"In the decades ahead, the major changes that will take place in economic terms will probably be here in Africa," said the French official.
6179	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	"If there is a time when France needs to consolidate its presence in Africa, it is now.
6180	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	For it is now that we should be laying the foundation for what will happen within the next 20 years," said Joyandet.
6183	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The remarks by the senior French official are coming at a time when analysts both inside and outside Africa are wondering whether France will pursue a policy of continuity with Africa or "a new break" as promised by President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of his electoral triumph.
6184	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Asked for comments, Joyandet, who replaced the outspoken Jean- Marie Bockel who openly criticized old-style ties with Africa, replied laconically that his aim is to lead to "the modernization of the existing relations between France and Africa."
6185	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	Addressing French nationals residing in Senegal in the presence of the ambassadorr Jean-Christophe Rufin, Joyandet took time to stress the benefits of the existing ties, including economic ones, between France and Senegal.
6187	XIN_ENG_20080503.0060.LDC2009T13	The turnover of French subsidiaries and companies accounted for 25 percent of Senegal's gross domestic product (GDP), said he, adding that the companies contributed nearly 28 percent of tax revenues, besides employing 15,000 people.

6364	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	The fate of the snakes was unclear in the reports.
6365	APW_ENG_20070307.0215.LDC2009T13	Phone calls to the wildlife department office in Penang went unanswered Wednesday morning.
6368	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"In agreement with the Palestinian Authority, the (European) commission will resume Wednesday, on a provisional basis, deliveries of fuel to the Gaza power plant," said a statement from an EU spokeswoman received by AFP in Jerusalem.
6369	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	No further details were immediately available.
6373	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The bloc had said it would resume payments as soon as it was given assurances to the contrary by the Islamists, who seized control in Gaza in a bloody takeover in mid-June.
6374	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Parts of Gaza have suffered from blackouts since late Friday, when the power plant reduced output because of dwindling fuel supplies.
6377	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	At a Hamas meeting, Haniya said that the "electricity company is independent and there is no interference in its administrative affairs... This is part of the pressure exerted on Gaza and attempts to break our will."
6378	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas said the power cuts amounted to a "collective punishment of the residents of Gaza (which) violates all international values and norms."
6379	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	The Western-backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called for the fuel supplies to be resumed, but said his Hamas rivals were to blame for the outages as it was pocketing money from electricity sales.
6380	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"The continuation of these power cuts are causing incommensurate harm to the life of our people, who are not guilty of the banditry by Hamas and its militias," he was quoted by his office as saying.
6382	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	Hamas has denied the allegations, saying it had arrested the head of the electricity company on charges of corruption.
6385	AFP_ENG_20070821.0230.LDC2009T13	"Agreements to supply electricity to Gaza's inhabitants should remain as they are and no party, whoever they might be, should use basic utilities as poitical cards," foreign ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said in a statement.

6430	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	President Hugo Chavez's government is trying to cope with scattered shortages of some foods, and long lines at state-run "Megamercal" street markets over the weekend show many Venezuelans are willing to wait for hours to snap up a handful of products they seldom find in supermarkets.
6433	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	She had almost managed to get powdered milk at a private supermarket -- only to watch someone else walk away with the last can.

6438	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	The shortages are prompting some Venezuelans to question Chavez's economic policies while he campaigns for constitutional changes that, if approved in a Dec. 2 referendum, would let him run for re-election indefinitely.
6440	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Economists say the factors behind the shortages are numerous, including surging demand due to economic growth.
6443	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	And importers also face hurdles.

6453	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Powdered milk is sold by black-market street vendors at US$10 (euro6.80) or more per kilogram (US$4.50/euro3 or more per pound) -- about twice the regulated price and four times the price offered by the state markets.
6454	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Bastida said she still believes in Chavez and plans to vote in favor of his reforms "so that things will get better."
6456	APW_ENG_20071120.1117.LDC2009T13	Others, speaking in hushed tons, said they see Chavez's government as a failure and do not want him to be able to run again in 2012.

6632	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	Japanese agricultural officials on Saturday identified the strain of the bird flu virus that caused the deaths of thousands of chickens at a poultry farm in southern Japan as belonging to the broad H5 family.
6635	APW_ENG_20070113.0514.LDC2009T13	At least 2,400 chickens have died since Wednesday at a farm in the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki prefecture (state), and prefectural officials were conducting bird flu tests.

6685	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	Billions of people will suffer water shortages and the number of hungry will grow by hundreds of millions by 2080 as global temperatures rise, scientists warn in a report leaked Tuesday.
6686	AFP_ENG_20070130.0048.LDC2009T13	The report estimates that between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion people will be suffering from water scarcity problems by 2080 and between 200 million and 600 million more people will be going hungry.

6747	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former Wimbledon winner, denied using cocaine.
6748	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I find this accusation so horrendous, so monstrous that I've decided to confront it head on by talking to the press," she said.
6749	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I am frustrated and angry.
6750	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	I believe that I am absolutely 100 percent innocent."
6755	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Mario Widmer, Hingis' manager, said he did not know why she waited until now to make the announcement.
6758	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	She came within one match of winning the Grand Slam in 1997, losing only in the French Open final.
6762	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis, who lost in the third round of the U.S. Open, hasn't played since her second-round loss to Peng Shuai of China, 7-5, 6-1, in Beijing on Sept. 19.
6768	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"They say that cocaine increases self-confidence and creates a type of euphoria," she said in a statement.
6769	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"I don't know.

6773	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she later underwent a privately arranged hair test which came back negative for cocaine.
6775	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	Hingis said she hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample taken during Wimbledon.
6776	APW_ENG_20071101.1217.LDC2009T13	"He is also convinced that the doping officials mishandled the process and would not be able to prove that the urine that was tested for cocaine actually came from me," she said.

6810	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	CARACAS, Venezuela
6811	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"They made Caracas into Calcutta," the Venezuelan writer Fausto Maso lamented in the epilogue of a recently reissued memoir of bohemian exploits in the 1970s and 1980s along Sabana Grande, the tree-lined boulevard that once symbolized this city's effervescent intellectual life.
6812	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Until recently, it was hard for anyone with the nerve to exit a subway stop on Sabana Grande to disagree with that assessment.
6813	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	About 3,000 street vendors associated with black-market sales and crime had taken over the boulevard since the start of the decade, and the area had become emblematic of the city's decline into lawlessness and neglect.
6814	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	But at the beginning of this year, buoyed by President Hugo Chavez's re-election victory, the local government allied with him responded to the many complaints about the area and cleared the vendors out.
6815	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Pedestrians have flowed back, giving hope of renewal to many people in the area.
6817	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Returning Sabana Grande to its past grandeur is no easy task in Caracas, a city of 4 million struggling with violent crime.
6819	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The police disputed the figure, saying that there were 169 killings.
6820	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	In Sabana Grande, pickpockets flourished under the vendors' plastic tarps, where products like pharmaceuticals of dubious origin, smuggled Colombian lingerie or pirated Hollywood DVDs were available.
6831	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Clearing out the vendors has also started a debate about the boulevard's future, with fervent supporters of the president trying to transform it into an area for discussing the direction of Venezuelan politics.
6833	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Rodriguez said the challenge was to prevent the boulevard from again becoming "a place full of boutiques for the bourgeoisie."
6835	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	They point to its surviving examples of the fanciful architecture and public art that blossomed in Caracas after World War II, like a sculpture of dangling plastic tubes by Jesus Soto that graces one end of Sabana Grande, or the Chacalito shopping center, whose open-air design feels innovative more than four decades after it was built.
6838	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The modern city they designed has gone through a wrenching transformation, though, after migration surged from other regions.
6839	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	The change is characterized by the growth of shantytowns on its hills and the cloistering of the privileged in gated communities and air-conditioned shopping malls.
6842	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Though officials are clearing street vendors from other areas, much of their focus has been on Sabana Grande.
6846	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It belongs to all Caraquenos and needs to be defended."
6848	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"It's no secret to anyone that there were years of madness between the government and the opposition and it wasn't the political moment to advance," he told reporters.
6849	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	Many of the street vendors themselves scoff at their removal to a nearby lot, even as city officials hang banners there saying, "Dignifying the Popular Economy."
6851	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"Chavez used the vendors," said Jairo Castro, a former vendor on Sabana Grande who voted for Chavez in December.
6852	NYT_ENG_20070510.0178.LDC2009T13	"We're no good to him anymore."

7066	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran warned Wednesday of a fierce response and radically higher oil prices if the country were attacked but also signalled possible progress in its five-year nuclear standoff with the West.
7067	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"Iran, if there were any kind of activity of any sort, is not going to be quiet and would react fiercely," Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari said here when asked what Tehran would do in the event of an attack.
7068	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	He added that oil prices, which have been driven to record levels partly because of fear about the loss of Iran's 4.0-million- barrel-a-day output, would rise sharply if Israel or the United States launched a military strike.
7069	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	His comments on the sidelines of an oil conference here came as Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking to US media, said that a "new process" was underway in the dispute about the country's nuclear programme.
7071	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Six world powers last month offered Iran a solution aimed at ending the crisis, offering technological incentives in exchange for Tehran suspending uranium enrichment, which the West fears could be used to make an atomic bomb.
7072	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	Iran has unveiled its own package, which is a more all-embracing effort to solve global problems and notably suggests the setting up of a consortium in Iran for enriching uranium.
7073	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"A process is underway and it started with the package delivered by Iran," Mottaki said in an interview with US media in New York, according to the state- run IRNA news agency.
7074	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	"This package tackled important questions and then on the other side the world powers offered their own package," he said.
7076	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	But recent reports in Western media have also suggested that Tehran is ready to adopt a softer line in the standoff and may be prepared to offer concessions to break the deadlock.
7077	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The foreign policy advisor to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday it would be in Iran's interest to accept the package and warned against provocative remarks that could destabilise the situation.
7078	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The White House said Wednesday that it was sceptical about Mottaki's comments and President George W. Bush again stressed that military action was possible despite his preference for diplomacy.
7081	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	No Iranian official has suggested in the past months that Tehran is ready to give any ground on the key question of enrichment, which Iran must suspend in order to enter the talks offered by the world powers.
7084	AFP_ENG_20080702.0276.LDC2009T13	The United States and its regional ally Israel have never ruled out military strikes to end what they see as Tehran's defiance.

7441	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Gustav hit Haiti as a hurricane on Tuesday, causing floods and landslides that killed 15 people on Haiti's deforested southern peninsula, where it dumped 12 inches (30 centimeters) or more of rain.
7443	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Gustav's projected track pointed directly at the Cayman Islands, an offshore banking center where residents boarded up homes and stocked up on emergency supplies.
7444	APW_ENG_20080828.0744.LDC2009T13	Forecasters said Gustav might slip between Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba on Sunday, then March toward a Tuesday collision with the U.S. Gulf Coast -- anywhere from south Texas to the Florida panhandle.

7464	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	SOME HOPE REPORT FINDING HPV IN MORE THAN 25% OF WOMEN DIFFUSES TENSION OVER CONTROVERSIAL CANCER VACCINE
7467	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The study, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides the most comprehensive assessment of human papillomavirus prevalence among American women.
7471	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	According to the study, just 3.4 percent of women were infected with the four types of HPV -- which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and most cases of genital warts and other health problems -- covered by the vaccine.
7474	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	The vaccine, recently recommended by federal health authorities for females ages 9 to 26, has become as much a political issue as a scientific one in Texas.
7476	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Perry said his goal was to protect future generations from cervical cancer, which afflicts more than 10,000 women a year in this country.
7479	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Last week, a bill passed a state House committee that would revoke Perry's order and make it illegal to mandate the Merck- manufactured HPV vaccine for girls.
7480	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Some scientists say they hope the new study can diffuse some of the tension surrounding the vaccine issue in Texas.
7482	NYT_ENG_20070227.0136.LDC2009T13	Stanberry said the significance of the new study for Texas is that the data on prevalence of HPV in the United States is similar to the estimates made in cost-effectiveness studies of the vaccine, suggesting that earlier research is valid.

9247	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	For the past 25 years, the Arizona State University professors have studied the intricacies of humor and found patterns that explain one of language's most powerful communication tools.
9250	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It works because it ridicules blue- collar and other stereotypes and is full of clever, absurd surprises, the Nilsens said.
9253	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Using humor can give you power in the workplace and help strengthen relationships.
9256	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Tell the wrong joke and you alienate people and become a jerk.
9258	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Forty years ago, Don Nilsen began using written jokes in his English classes to make grammar lessons more interesting.
9260	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Intrigued, the Nilsens started investigating humor.
9264	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The methods of research are unconventional.
9266	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	They are voracious readers of anything funny.
9271	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Don Nilsen considers himself a bad joke-teller, though it doesn't stop him from trying.
9272	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"I'm just awful because I'm thinking, thinking, thinking and setting up the joke.

9276	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"It's more challenging with some people," said Alleen Nilsen, citing former Vice President Al Gore as an example.
9277	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	The key is to pay attention, be an observer and find your type of humor.
9278	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Some people are better at sarcasm, others at deadpan.
9280	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	But humor is much broader.
9287	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	"Almost all jokes relate to errors or problems or tragedies or something edgy, something that went wrong," Don Nilsen said.
9293	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Here are some basic rules to avoid trouble, what the Nilsens call the Three Humane Humor Rules:
9294	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Never target something people cannot change, such as their height or sex.
9296	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	This can be perceived as mean humor.
9297	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	It's safer to ridicule politicians or big government.
9298	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	-Use humor not to take away someone's power but to give them strength.
9299	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Alleen Nilsen used to keep notes about humor that cropped up in university meetings.
9300	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Canned jokes often did not go over well because they came across as forced.
9306	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Others chime in, and any tension in the room dissolves.
9308	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Making fun of one's self also is fairly safe.
9309	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Self-deprecating humor is empowering, Don Nilsen said, because it says, "I'm mature enough to joke about my issues."
9310	NYT_ENG_20070401.0013.LDC2009T13	Beyond the workplace, the Nilsens hope their research will make people aware of how important humor is in communication.

9852	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	The decision on the federal funds rate, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's "pause" in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative.
9853	NYT_ENG_20070628.0157.LDC2009T13	In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had "improved modestly" in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as "somewhat elevated."

10519	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	The anti-Syrian ruling majority and pro-Syrian opposition have not strike a deal on a compromise candidate despite intensive international mediation, drawing speculations that Friday's session, which has been delayed for four times since September, might be postponed again.
10520	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Early in the morning, a crowd of journalists assembled outside the parliament building, waiting for parliamentarians to show up for the planned session.
10522	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, vigilant soldiers, police and guards are heavily deployed along the street, with more armed vehicles and tanks at major intersections.
10523	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	Under Lebanon's constitution, if no president is elected by the parliament in time limit, presidential powers pass to the government.
10524	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	But Lahoud has reiterated that he will not hand over the power to the government led by Prime Minister Fouad Seniora, which he considered as "illegitimate."
10526	XIN_ENG_20071123.0120.LDC2009T13	A two-thirds majority is required for a candidate to be elected by parliament in a first round of voting.

10532	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Rafael Nadal extended his record run on clay to 69 straight wins as he moved a step closer to a title hat-trick at the Barcelona Open on Thursday.
10534	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal said he is under no pressure when he plays, but knows that his charmed life cannot go on forever.
10539	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	After riding roughshod over the number 73 Johansson in a 21-minute opener, Nadal looked like having things all his own way.
10541	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Johansson fired six aces and held serve in a marathon sixth game featuring eight deuces.
10542	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	But Nadal had the last word in front of his home public, breaking for victory in the final game after Johansson followed an ace with a run of errors.
10544	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	The Spaniard is bidding to collect a hat-trick of Barcelona titles, aiming to become the second man after Swede Mats Wilander (1982-1984) to win the event three times on the trot.
10547	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	"It's unbelievable to win 69 on clay and it's especially nice to play here, where I have so much support."
10548	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Nadal improved his Barcelona career record to 13-1, his lone loss coming in 2003 when he was beaten as a teenager in the second round by Alex Corretja.
10551	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	But there was a home loss as Argentine Agustin Calleri upset number three and 2006 finalist Tommy Robredo 6-4, 2-6, 6-3.
10552	AFP_ENG_20070426.0570.LDC2009T13	Second seed Nikolay Davydenko won a momentum-shifting match over Filippo Volandri, coming from 2-5 down in the second-set tie- breaker.

10561	APW_ENG_20070808.1054.LDC2009T13	Police officials in Luxembourg did not immediately answer phone calls late Wednesday.
10562	APW_ENG_20070808.1054.LDC2009T13	The Paris prosecutor's office said investigators "were in an initial phase of verifying the information that was passed along."
10568	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Here in China, people have embraced a different view
10569	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	they regard Tibet as a historical part of the nation and see its sympathizers in the West as easily fooled romantics.
10576	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks are very easily influenced by their religious leader, so they are irrational compared to other types of people," he added.
10582	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Now, he predicted, the Chinese government will use the violence as a reason to round up the most prominent activist monks and "tighten its control over Tibet."
10583	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"I believe the government is capable of resolving this situation," said a young woman walking in central Beijing on a brilliant spring afternoon.
10586	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"They are all Chinese citizens," he added.
10587	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"The monks who are connected to this conduct have to be arrested.
10588	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Otherwise, it is not in conformity with rule by law."
10589	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Dramatizing how broadly such views are held even among the computer-savvy young generation, similar outrage exploded on the Internet after the Icelandic pop singer Bjork capped a concert in Shanghai on March 2 by shouting "Tibet!
10592	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Censorship officials huffed about how her gesture was out of place and pledged to tighten controls over foreign performers in China.
10593	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Tibet Autonomous Region's local government issued an announcement after the riots saying the Dalai Lama and his followers instigated the violence "intending to break Tibet away from the motherland."
10594	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Their allegation reflected China's long- standing complaint that the Dalai Lama, though he preaches limited autonomy, in fact has not abandoned his campaign to make Tibet and its 2.8 million residents fully independent from China.
10595	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	For those with long memories in Beijing, that has always been the situation.
10596	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama, now 72, led a violent uprising with help from the Central Intelligence Agency after Chinese troops reimposed rule from Beijing in 1950.
10601	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	With the Dalai Lama as its leader, however, Tibet governed itself as an independent nation while China was torn by the upheavals of the first half of the 20th century.
10602	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	So for Beijing officials and the public they have educated through propaganda, the Dalai Lama is less a devout Buddhist than a secessionist rebel.
10605	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Dalai Lama's hold on people's imagination in the West has long irritated the Chinese government.
10606	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The New China News Agency editorial described his Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in 1989, as "tainted" by Friday's rioting.
10607	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Congressional Gold Medal, which injected a chill into U.S.-China relations last October, turned out to be a "fig leaf" for the "rhetoric lama to sell his deceitful philosophy," it said.
10608	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	In any case, the Chinese government has portrayed its presence in Tibet as beneficial for the population, citing the breakup of traditional serfdom in the countryside, improved health care and school construction.
10609	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	A Beijing-to-Lhasa train that began service in July 2006 was designed to further accelerate economic development, bringing in tourists and taking out minerals.
10610	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The economic development has been accompanied by an influx of Han Chinese who, Tibetan nationalists complain, have tightened their grip on all the economic and political levers.
10611	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	The Han Chinese who were killed in Friday's rioting, for instance, were identified as shop owners and employees singled out by Tibetans resentful of their economic domination.
10613	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Signs along the main street leading to Lhasa's celebrated Jokhang Temple, they note, are just as likely to be written in Chinese as Tibetan, and the saleswomen tend to speak Mandarin rather than the region's own tongue.
10615	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	Like the American West in the 19th century, he said, modernization of China's West in the 21st century is bound to dilute the traditional Tibetan ways so esteemed abroad.
10616	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"China's government does not intend to destroy Tibetan culture," he said.
10617	LTW_ENG_20080317.0056.LDC2009T13	"But with the economy developing, the culture will change gradually, the same as in other places in the world."

10776	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	Researchers working in Nagano prefecture (state) estimate the fossilized skull bones and jaw of a right whale on display at the Shinshushinmachi Fossil Museum to be 5 million to 6 million years old, said museum curator Ken Narita.
10778	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	"This was an amazing find, and to have found the oldest one of this type makes it truly remarkable," he said.
10779	APW_ENG_20070704.0754.LDC2009T13	The skeleton was first discovered in 1938, when residents found the whale's spine and rib bones exposed on the ground.

10793	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Like other major biotechnology companies, Biogen Idec Inc. has a cadre of talented scientists working feverishly to discover breakthrough drugs.
10795	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Now, Biogen Idec is trying a new approach: setting up an incubator to help biotech start-ups get off the ground by providing them with funding, technical expertise, and office and laboratory space near its Kendall Square headquarters.
10796	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	After spending more than a year getting the incubator ready, Biogen Idec plans to disclose Wednesdaythat it has signed up its first tenant, Escoublac, a new company based on research from a Columbia University researcher.
10797	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	It hopes to unveil its second tenant next month.
10799	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	As the biotech revolution matures, Biogen Idec and other companies are trying to find creative ways to get in on the ground floor of promising research developed outside their laboratories.
10800	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	A few, like Biogen Idec, are setting up corporate incubators.
10802	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	In addition, Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge said it is considering stepping up investments in young companies or setting up an incubator of its own.
10804	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	"We've been actively considering ideas on how we might establish some form of incubator complex."
10805	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	Others are using a different strategy.
10807	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	The Cambridge biotech company said Harvard researchers will be able to publish their results freely and retain the rights to any technology they develop - something barred by some corporate research funders.
10809	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company has already received dozens of proposals and decided to fund five of them, starting next year - committing a total of several million dollars over three years.
10814	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	He said the company sifted through more than 100 ideas before settling on Escoublac, founded by Columbia Medical Center professor Gerard Karsenty, who has found links between bone biology and metabolism.
10826	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	That way, the companies might be better able to forge their own identities.
10828	NYT_ENG_20071218.0232.LDC2009T13	But biotech executives say it could take years to determine which approach works best.

11124	AFP_ENG_20081112.0734.LDC2009T13	The easing in electronics shipments, the country's top export, was offset by gains in sales of petroleum and copper, the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.

11241	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee will make a surprise visit Friday to Washington so that he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice can formally sign the accord itself, a senior US official said.
11242	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signed the deal in July 2005, touching off a difficult battle with wary lawmakers on either side and critics who warn it undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear know-how.
11243	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	The agreement offers India access to sophisticated US technology and cheap atomic energy in return for allowing UN inspections of some of its civilian nuclear facilities -- but not military nuclear sites.
11244	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Washington imposed a ban on US-Indian civilian nuclear trade after India's first nuclear test in 1974, but US officials have said a new approach is needed to help the world's largest democracy meet its booming energy needs at a time of skyrocketing oil prices and global warming fears.
11245	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Saturday, Rice called the accord "a recognition of India’s emergence on the global stage" while Mukherjee cited improved relations since the Cold War era, when New Delhi steered an independent course from Washington.
11247	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	US lawmakers, and roughly 200 guests including Indian-American community leaders, will also attend the signing ceremony, according to Bush spokesman Carlton Carroll.
11248	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Neither Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama nor Republican rival John McCain were expected to break from campaigning to attend the signing.
11249	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	"The president looks forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to strengthen the US-India Strategic Partnership," Carroll said in a statement.
11253	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	Lawmakers had sought safeguards on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons technology before passing it overwhelmingly last week and handing the increasingly unpopular Bush administration a foreign policy success.
11254	AFP_ENG_20081008.0311.LDC2009T13	But critics say it still undermines global efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, because India has refused to sign the international non-proliferation treaty (NPT).

11286	APW_ENG_20080130.1492.LDC2009T13	"For many consumers, a new vehicle purchase has become largely a discretionary item."

12258	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	Pope Benedict XVI called Monday for a peace accord in the Middle East, embroiled in a "conflict that has persisted for too long," during his New Year's Day mass at Saint Peter's Basilica.
12263	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	On December 12 Benedict sent a message to the world's 1.1 billion Catholics ahead of World Peace Day in which he condemned what he called the transformation of religion "into an ideology," and said that "a war in the name of God is never acceptable."
12265	AFP_ENG_20070101.0089.LDC2009T13	"The way to ensure a future of peace for everyone is found not only in international accords for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also in the determined commitment to seek their reduction and definitive dismantling," the pope said.
12271	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator," Bollinger said, to applause.
12272	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He said Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust might fool the illiterate and ignorant.
12274	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"The truth is that the Holocaust is the most documented event in human history."
12276	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There were insults and claims that were incorrect, regretfully," Ahmadinejad said, accusing Bollinger of falling under the influence of the hostile U.S. press and politicians.
12279	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	In response to one audience, Ahmadinejad denied he was questioning the existence of the Holocaust: "Granted this happened, what does it have to do with the Palestinian people?"
12280	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But then he said he was defending the rights of European scholars, an apparent reference to a small number who have been prosecuted under national laws for denying or minimizing the Holocaust.
12281	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"There's nothing known as absolute," he said.
12282	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	He reiterated his desire to visit ground zero to express sympathy with the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, but then appeared to question whether al-Qaida was responsible.
12285	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	What conditions led to it?"
12292	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	I don't know who's told you that we have this."
12294	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	But the strident and personal nature of his attack on the president of Iran was startling.
12295	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated," Bollinger told Ahmadinejad about the leader's Holocaust denial.
12300	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	U.S. President George W. Bush said Ahmadinejad's appearance at Columbia "speaks volumes about really the greatness of America."
12302	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Other American officials were less sympathetic.
12304	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said "there is a world of difference between not preventing Ahmadinejad from speaking and handing a megalomaniac a megaphone and a stage to use it."
12310	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	"We're here today to send a message that there is never a reason to give a hatemonger an open stage," New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said.
12312	APW_ENG_20070924.1107.LDC2009T13	Dozens stood near the lecture hall where Ahmadinejad was scheduled to speak, linking arms and singing traditional Jewish folk songs about peace and brotherhood, while nearby a two-person band played "You Are My Sunshine."

12362	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Finance ministers from the 13 nations that use the euro agreed Friday to use the tax windfalls they are currently enjoying to cut debt and make other changes that the EU says are needed to deal with the costs of their aging populations.
12364	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	As Europe revels in its fastest growth spurt this decade, EU officials are urging euro nations to cut their budget deficits.
12367	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	This would see most of them reach a medium-term goal of putting their finances on track in 2008 or 2009 -- with 2010 set as the ultimate deadline.
12369	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Reducing debt more quickly is not required, but EU officials stressed that nations know they must try to avoid past mistakes that saw the euro-zone's two largest economies, Germany and France, repeatedly break the rules with deficits that were too high.
12370	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The euro's high value could be a worry because it makes European exports more expensive to customers in the United States and competing unfavorably with Japanese rivals benefiting from the weak yen.
12371	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said he had heard assurances from both the United States and Japan that they did not want to see their currencies at such lows.
12373	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	Japan's finance minister and head of the Central Bank told the G-7 meeting in Washington last week that the Japanese exchange rates should reflect the fact that the nation's economy is recovering.

12375	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	"I haven't had anybody knocking on my door complaining about the euro rate," he told reporters.
12377	APW_ENG_20070420.1288.LDC2009T13	The euro rose to a two-year high Wednesday but stopped short of hitting its record, even as the British pound reached a 26-year high after breaking the US$2 mark this week.

12400	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU is China's largest trading partner and this status gives the Asian giant "real responsibilities," Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a speech at the 10th annual EU-China summit in Beijing.
12401	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	His comments came as EU impatience is growing over the trade surplus, which hit euro128 billion ($190 billion) last year and expected to reach euro170 billion ($253 billion) this year.
12402	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The weakness of China's currency, the yuan, against the euro also makes exports to China more expensive.
12407	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The high-level talks in Beijing focused also on other economic concerns, such as boosting Beijing's fight against copyright piracy.
12408	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who spoke after Mandelson, tried to address some of those points, saying Beijing has put in measures to expand imports and stimulate domestic demand.
12411	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The EU and China have agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue in March, officials said.
12412	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Also in Beijing on Wednesday, the EU's top finance officials warned that the weak yuan and looming Chinese trade surplus threatened to spark a backlash in Europe.
12414	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia traveled to China for talks with Wen and other officials.
12416	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Juncker, speaking as head of a committee of eurozone finance ministers known as the Eurogroup, said he and the other members were befuddled by the euro's continued strength against the yuan, even as the Chinese currency gains steadily against the dollar.
12417	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"It is difficult to understand, whereas China is exporting less to the U.S. than to Europe, why the yuan is appreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and why the yuan is depreciating against the euro," Juncker told reporters.
12419	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	Earlier Wednesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is leading the EU delegation, met with a rising star of the Chinese political establishment.
12422	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	"China's relations with the EU date back to the early days of the European Community," Li said.
12424	APW_ENG_20071128.0730.LDC2009T13	The group also met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who called the summit "an effective platform for cooperation and exchanges between the two sides."
12429	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Five days after the vote, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission still had not released results on the presidential election despite increasing international pressure, including from former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who recently mediated an end to Kenya's postelection violence.
12431	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The police raids came a day after official results showed Mugabe's party had lost control of parliament's 210-member lower house.
12432	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The election commission was slow on the 60 elected seats in the Senate, releasing the first returns late Thursday that gave five seats each to the opposition and ruling party.
12436	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was given to the generals earlier in the day, he said.
12439	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	It was not clear who ordered the generals not to attend the meeting, but the fact that some senior officers apparently were willing to meet with Tsvangirai underlined reports of rifts within the highly politicized upper echelons of Zimbabwe's security forces.
12440	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats in Harare and at the United Nations said Mugabe was planning to declare a 90-day delay to a presidential run-off to give security forces time to clamp down.
12441	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The law requires a run- off be held within 21 days of an election, but Mugabe could change that with a presidential decree, a Western diplomat in Harare said.
12443	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti said hotel rooms used as offices by the opposition at a Harare hotel were ransacked by intruders he believed were either police or agents of the feared Central Intelligence Organization.
12444	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"Mugabe has started a crackdown," Biti told The Associated Press.
12446	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Biti said the raid at the Meikles Hotel targeted "certain people ... including myself."
12447	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He said Tsvangirai was "safe" but had canceled plans for a news conference.
12448	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Tsvangirai was arrested and severely beaten by police a year ago after a banned opposition rally.
12454	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	She said the other three were released.
12456	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Seemingly laying the groundwork for a Mugabe run-off campaign, the state-run Herald newspaper said the ruling ZANU-PF party was running neck and neck with the opposition in the vote count, and it highlighted divisions among Mugabe's foes.
12457	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The Herald also charged that Tsvangirai would give farmland back to whites.
12458	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	The opposition leader has not said that, but has promised to make an equitable distribution of land to people who know how to farm.
12459	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe claimed his land reform was to benefit poor blacks, but gave most seized farms to relatives, friends and cronies, and agricultural production has plunged.
12460	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Mugabe has sought to deflect criticism over widespread shortages of food, fuel and other goods by blaming former colonizer Britain and other Western nations.
12461	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	But Western sanctions involve only visa bans and frozen bank accounts for Mugabe and about 100 of his allies.
12462	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Independent election observers say their projections based on election results posted at a representative sample of local polling stations indicate Tsvangirai won the most votes in the presidential contest, but not enough to avoid a run-off.
12464	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Diplomats said Thursday's events indicated he might be considering of a third option: declaring a state of emergency and suppressing the opposition.
12465	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga said Mugabe was ready for a run-off.

12467	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	He is not going anywhere.
12470	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	Nathan Shamuyarira, the party's secretary for information and publicity, said "we have many meetings tomorrow," but declined details.

12474	APW_ENG_20080403.1570.LDC2009T13	"We live in an open world today and indeed the eyes of the world are on Zimbabwe, on its electoral commission, on its president," Annan said.

12745	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal audit of 18 beef slaughterhouses following the U.S.'s largest beef recall found humane handling violations in four of them, including one serious enough for the plant to be temporarily suspended.
12746	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The audit by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service concluded that a plant was insufficiently stunning animals, failing to make them insensible to pain on the first attempt.
12747	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	That plant has taken corrective actions and its suspension has been lifted, said Agriculture Secretary Edward Schafer.
12751	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Earlier this year, the department recalled 143 million pounds of meat from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. in Chino, California, following an undercover video by the Humane Society of the United States that showed slaughterhouse workers abusing "downer" cattle -- those too sick or injured to stand.
12752	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	The USDA's audit did not uncover problems with downer cattle, but it did issue "noncompliance" records to plants for excessive use of electronic stunning prods
12755	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Those three were in addition to the plant that was suspended for insufficient stunning.
12756	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	In addition, one plant received a "letter of concern" for using a high-powered hose to wash cattle before slaughter.
12757	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	While not a violation, FSIS informed the plant that care should be taken to avoid undue stress or excitement to the animals.
12759	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We are confident that USDA can do a better job," he added.
12760	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"We have helped train our inspectors to observe while being unobserved, so that they can properly watch over the system."
12761	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	Kohl said later that while he was pleased most plants met basic humane handling standards, "I remain concerned at least one plant other than Westland/Hallmark had a problem serious enough to warrant a notice of suspension, and several plants were found not in compliance with humane handling practices.
12767	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	He said that following his group's investigation, slaughterhouses would likely be on higher alert -- especially these 18, since Schafer had announced in February that they would be audited.
12768	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"That is a pretty high rate of violation in light of the fact that USDA inspectors were known to be present, and that this occurred after the Hallmark investigation," he said.
12769	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"This letter is not reassuring.
12772	APW_ENG_20080408.1488.LDC2009T13	"In fact," she said, "given the additional scrutiny these plants experienced through the in-depth audits, the findings should be reassuring to consumers and should underscore that the California video released in January truly was an anomaly."

14892	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	The secretary-general said Kosovo's declaration of independence and subsequent events have posed significant challenges to UNMIK's ability to exercise its administrative authority in Kosovo.
14893	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	"The evolving reality in Kosovo is likely to have significant operational implications for UNMIK," he said.
14897	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	In that context, he urges all sides to reaffirm and act upon their commitments to refrain from any actions or statements that could endanger peace, lead to violence or jeopardize security in Kosovo and the region.
14899	XIN_ENG_20080401.0121.LDC2009T13	Adopted in June 1999, resolution 1244 recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia and puts the breakaway province under UN administration.

14903	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	The key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against Iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in," Ahmadinejad said.
14908	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	"There's no real limit," said the diplomat on condition of anonymity after Washington set the deadline.
14910	AFP_ENG_20080801.0112.LDC2009T13	Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on Thursday that there was no deadline and that his country had already replied.

14915	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Islam needs a Reformation.
14916	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It needs someone with the courage of Martin Luther.
14917	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	This is the belief I've arrived at after a long and painful spiritual journey.
14918	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's not a popular conviction -- it has attracted angry criticism, including death threats, from many sides.
14919	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But it was reinforced by Sept. 11, 2001, and in the years since, I've only become more convinced that it is critical to Islam's future.
14920	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Muslims are too rigid in our adherence to old, literal interpretations of the Koran.
14923	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	It's time for Muslims to question our leaders and their strict teachings, to reach our own understanding of the prophet's words and to call for a bold renewal of our faith as a faith of goodwill, of peace and of light.
14924	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I didn't always think this way.
14926	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I was a jihadist.
14927	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I grew up in Saudi Arabia.
14931	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I joined a hard-line Salafi group.
14932	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I abandoned modern life and lived in a mud hut, apart from my family.
14934	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My involvement with this group led me to violence, and landed me in prison.
14936	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Yet all the while, my doubts remained.
14937	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Was the Koran really the word of God?
14941	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	At the same time, my eyes were opened to the hypocrisy of so many who held themselves out as Muslim role models.
14952	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Others would no longer pray behind me.
14953	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Under this pressure, I left the mosque.
14954	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I moved to the southern city of Abha, where I took a job as a writer and editor with a newly established newspaper.
14955	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to leading prayers at the paper's small mosque and to writing about my evolving philosophy.
14957	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave new life to what I had been saying.
14958	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I went back to criticizing the rote manner in which we Muslims are fed our religion.
14960	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I pointed to examples from Islamic history that stressed the need to get along with other religions.
14963	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I lost a lot of friends after that.
14964	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	My old companions from the jihad felt obliged to declare themselves either with me or against me.
14965	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Some preferred to cut their links to me silently, but others fought me publicly, issuing statements filled with curses and lies.
14968	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Eventually I was fired.
14969	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But by then, I had started to develop a different relationship with God.
14973	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Don't sweat the details, the prophet said.
14974	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I felt at peace, and no longer doubted the existence of God.
14978	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	Two years later, I told al-Arabiya television that I thought God loves all faithful people of different religions.
14985	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	The God of light would not be happy to see people suffer, even if they had sinned and made mistakes along the way.
14986	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	I had found my Islam.
14988	LTW_ENG_20070726.0001.LDC2009T13	But first we need a Reformation similar to the Protestant Reformation that Martin Luther led against the Roman Catholic Church.

15110	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The spill occurred when a cargo ship struck the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge in heavy fog last week, tearing a gash in its hull.
15111	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The pilot of the ship said he immediately reported the presence of oil in the water, but cleanup crews did not arrive on the scene for nearly 90 minutes.
15113	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger pledged an investigation into the spill and the Coast Guard's response to the incident.
15114	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"We have to really make sure that we investigate this thoroughly and to see also if we as a state can do more in order to prevent those kind of accidents," Schwarzenegger said.
15117	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Initial reports had the spill at just 140 gallons (530 liters)
15118	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	the Coast Guard waited hours after learning it was really 58,000 gallons (219,550 liters) before notifying local officials.
15119	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Earlier, Schwarzenegger signed an executive order that will suspend commercial and sport fishing until Dec. 1, or until state health officials decide it is safe.
15120	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Governor's spokesman Jeff Macedo said the state Department of Fish and Game will determine which fishing areas will be affected by the order.
15122	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	They are worried the crabs could be contaminated because ocean and bay water is used to keep the crustaceans alive in fishing boats after they are harvested from the sea floor.
15124	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Schwarzenegger also ordered the state Department of Public Health to determine whether people can become sick if they eat seafood caught in areas impacted by the spill.
15125	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The type of oil that spilled -- so-called bunker fuel -- is a sticky byproduct of oil refining that is packed with pollutants and slow to break down.
15127	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	Rear Adm. Craig Bone, the top Coast Guard officer in California, said Monday that the owners and operators of the ship will unquestionably face civil penalties, and that criminal counts were a possibility.
15128	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	The ship -- the Cosco Busan -- is owned by Hong Kong-based Regal Stone.
15129	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	A lawyer for the ship pilot said Monday that his client did not immediately realize the severity of the crash that led to the leak.

15133	APW_ENG_20071113.1525.LDC2009T13	"From the beginning of the incident, Regal Stone has come forward and been very proactive and engaged with law enforcement officials," Wilson said.

15153	AFP_ENG_20070601.0480.LDC2009T13	The group accused Beijing of harassing survivors, their families and those who challenged what it called the official "whitewash" of events and said the Chinese government had failed to bring justice to the victims of the massacre.

15173	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In accordance with the detailed basic principles adopted by the national convention, the future name of Myanmar will be the Republic of Union of Myanmar and the country's capital be Nay Pyi Taw which was just moved by the military government from Yangon.
15174	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The country will adopt an executive system of President as head of state and empower a Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (Union Parliament) which comprises Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) in legislation.
15176	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles designate that the country's administrative regions will, as similar to the present, be demarcated as seven regions (now known as divisions) and seven states of national races, and six other ethnic minorities who will have their self- administered zones or higher-level division.
15177	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The basic principles prescribe that the military should hold 25 percent of the parliament representatives in different-level parliaments and they are to be nominated by the armed forces' commander-in-chief.
15179	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The defense services commander-in-chief will represent the supreme commander of all armed forces and has the right to take over and exercise state power in case of state emergency that could cause disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of national sovereignty.
15182	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The Myanmar military took over the power of state on Sept. 18, 1988 after experiencing months-long political instability and adopted at once a multi-party political system and market- oriented economic system.
15183	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	The military government sponsored a multi-party general election across the country on May 27, 1990, in which Aung-San- Suu-Kyi- led National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 parliamentary seats out of 485.
15187	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	In line with the roadmap, Myanmar resumed holding of the constitutional national convention, restarting the constitution- drafting process.
15188	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	However, citing the reason of military government's house arrest placed on the party's general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and its vice-chairman U Tin Oo, the NLD kept boycotting the convention until its end.
15190	XIN_ENG_20070903.0046.LDC2009T13	Observers here commented that Myanmar's constitution-drafting process is still not finished yet and the public concern will naturally focus on the country people's decision on the drafted constitution in the upcoming national referendum.

15253	NYT_ENG_20070208.0083.LDC2009T13	That is the makeover Mr. Silence of the Lambs gets in "Hannibal Rising," a new prequel that tries to explain the guy's yen for human flesh.

15380	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Celtics fans figured this was the night the team would revert to their green jersey dominance of the regular season.
15381	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Hub hoop junkies witnessed the ease of a Game 2 victory at TD Banknorth Garden and concluded that the real Celtics were ready to take it to the streets of Cleveland.

15387	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was the Celtics' most lopsided loss of the season.
15397	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	Cleveland has the Cavs, but the Celtics were the ones with the cavalier attitude.

15401	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	They outcoached us, they played harder, they got the loose balls.

15407	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	This caliber of play is simply not going to cut it against the Pistons, Lakers, or Hornets.
15409	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	The questions will be asked again and again until the Celtics win a road game in the 2008 NBA playoffs.

15437	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It was 32-13 after one - exactly the type of start the Celtics were hoping to avoid.
15442	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	But that's hustle.
15446	NYT_ENG_20080511.0078.LDC2009T13	It feels like the Celtics are being exposed.

15456	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang Wenkang -- open on AIDS, less so on SARS -- set to lose job
15460	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Zhang, born in Shanghai in 1940, has been widely criticized since he told a press conference early this month that the SARS virus had been put "under control".
15462	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Perhaps unrelated to this fact -- and perhaps not -- is Zhang's extensive background within military medicine.
15463	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	After receiving a medical degree in 1962, he spent the next more than three decades in jobs associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
15466	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	In this new job, he was faced with several tough jobs, including creating a more market-based public health system and curbing the spread of AIDS in China.
15467	AFP_ENG_20030420.0258.LDC2007T07	Remarkably, given his record on SARS, Zhang is on record for several frank remarks on AIDS, including the somber prediction China could have 10 million HIV positive people in 2010.

15556	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	In today's perpetual workplace, where downtime has merged with work time, where you can carry your office in your pocket, where collars are no longer distinctly blue or white, how does one measure overtime?
15558	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	It is worth noting that the language is backward when it comes to overtime.
15560	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But here it means you are not entitled to overtime under the law.

15568	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The most common question posted on the "Ask a Lawyer" section of the group's Web site, Fox said, is about overtime: "Who's eligible?
15570	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	What counts toward overtime?"
15574	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	Lawsuits brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, by employees claiming they had been illegally declared ineligible and demanding back overtime pay, have increased by 50 percent since the changes were made, mostly in the form of large class-action suits.
15583	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	"That counts as working time," said Mark Thierman, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Reno, Nev., "particularly if you don't feel you can turn around and say 'I'm on my lunch break and I'll get to it later.'

15590	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	The law has long and consistently excluded commuting from hours worked.
15591	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	But as commutes grow longer, and workers use time on the train (and, heaven help us, in the car) to tap on their laptop or BlackBerry, the exceptions are starting to define the rule.
15596	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	First is the practical fact that time worked outside of work is hard to track.
15603	NYT_ENG_20070919.0124.LDC2009T13	A second reason is the prevalence of an office culture that says overwork is rewarded with bragging rights, not money.

15763	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Rising food prices continue to threaten South Africa's household food security, the National Agricultural Marketing Council said on Thursday.
15764	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Senior economist Tema Nkgasha Pieter said although food prices had risen at a slower rate in January compared to December, from January 2007 to January 2008 the Consumer Price Index for Food was 13.4 percent.
15772	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Meat products increased at a much slower rate that most other food products.
15773	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	"The increase in grain prices was mainly due to pressure on international and domestic grain stocks, while the increases in vegetable prices can be largely attributed to climate events," said Pieter.
15774	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	According to the medium term outlook, agricultural commodity prices would remain high but stable.
15775	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Exchange rate fluctuations and climate events could change this situation however.
15777	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	Demand for high-valued ready-to-eat and takeaway types of food was expected to decline.
15779	XIN_ENG_20080228.0300.LDC2009T13	This would be due to slower growth in consumer expenditure, favorable climatic conditions improving production levels and the potential stabilization of international grain, oilseed and livestock markets.

15798	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr was largely responsible for putting al-Maliki in power last year, throwing his legislative bloc behind al-Maliki at a key point.
15799	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Now, he, too, has taken steps to distance himself from the prime minister without giving up the power he holds as head of one of the two largest groups in the Shiite alliance that dominates parliament.

15803	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	He has reached out to Sunni Arab leaders and has purged some of his followers who refused to rein in their activities.
15805	LTW_ENG_20070526.0073.LDC2009T13	Al-Sadr, as a nationalist and opponent of the U.S. presence, might have the ability to forge allies among Sunni Arabs and thus could represent a potent counterpoint to pro-American politicians such as al-Maliki, said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense Department official and military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

15834	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The inspiration for the new rules was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
15836	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	It also pointed out something that air travelers learned all too well last summer: Delays originating at New York airports alone can account for up to one-third of the air-travel delays throughout the nation.
15838	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The new pricing scheme would encourage the airlines to stop packing their schedules with flights in certain parts of the day.
15839	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The result could be a more even distribution of arrivals and departures throughout the day, and the diversion of some flights to nearby, underutilized airports.
15840	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	The other goal would be to persuade the airlines to use planes that carry more passengers and reduce their use of smaller, regional jets.
15842	LTW_ENG_20080123.0002.LDC2009T13	Of course, the airlines aren't too keen on the new rules, which would go into effect after a 45-day comment period if no significant changes are required.

16190	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Human rights groups lashed out at Myanmar's military leaders for evicting cyclone refugees from relief camps and forcing them back to their isolated, storm-shattered homes.
16193	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In Yangon, there were eyewitness reports of one eviction from a Christian church.
16195	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"While agriculture recovery is indeed vital, forcing people home without aid makes it harder for aid agencies to reach them with assistance," it said.
16196	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Eight camps set up for homeless survivors in the Irrawaddy delta town of Bogalay were "totally empty" as the clear-out continued, said Teh Tai Ring of the United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- at a meeting of U.N. and private aid agency workers discussing water and sanitation issues.
16199	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	In his remarks at the water experts' meeting, however, Teh said the information came from a relief worker who had just returned from the affected area and that "tears were shed" when he recounted his findings earlier in the day.
16202	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	"Those villagers lost their homes, their family members and the whole village was washed away.

16204	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	All the refuge seekers except some pregnant women, two young children and those with severe illnesses left the church in eleven trucks Friday morning.
16207	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	Some foreign aid workers are still awaiting visas, and the government is taking 48 hours to process requests to enter the Irrawaddy delta, the groups said.

16211	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	UNICEF's Teh said some of the refugees were "being given rations and then they are forced to move."
16213	APW_ENG_20080531.0072.LDC2009T13	The government's reasons for allegedly moving people out of camps and shelters have not been publicly clarified, but it earlier declared the "relief" phase of the rescue effort over and said it was time for "reconstruction."

16228	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	For the first time, economic growth in the eurozone recorded a quarterly decrease in the three months from April to June this year, figures from the European Union (EU)'s statistics bureau Eurostat showed Wednesday.
16231	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	As EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Thursday, forecasts of a recession in Europe and the United States could become the "central scenario."
16232	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Forecasts for recessions on both sides of the Atlantic "run the risk of becoming the central scenario in the coming months," Almunia told a conference in Madrid, Spain.
16234	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Without any knowledge of which one would be the next victim, financial institutions in the eurozone have become extremely reluctant to lend to each other, resulting in a more serious credit crunch.
16235	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Despite furious efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to inject liquidity into the financial markets, no big turn was observed.
16236	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Economists fear that a prolonged money market freeze would have a significant impact on overall lending to businesses and individuals, undermining confidence and threatening the real economy.
16237	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Figures from the European Commission showed that economic confidence in the eurozone continued to fall in September, hitting the lowest level since November 2001, i.e. shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, while the business climate decreased significantly to values last observed in 2003.
16238	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Last month, Almunia warned that the financial crisis is hurting Europe's real economy.
16239	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	"There can be no doubt that events in the financial sector are hurting the real economy," he told a European Parliament plenary session.
16240	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Almunia said the effects of the financial turmoil have been compounded by the inflationary pressures of rising oil and commodity prices and the severe housing market corrections in some EU member states.
16245	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	High inflation erodes purchasing power of every family, dampening private consumption, a key driver behind eurozone economic growth.
16247	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	Among large members in the eurozone, Germany, France and Italy, which together make up two thirds of the eurozone gross domestic product, all reported a quarterly drop in the second quarter.
16252	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	The Commission said the dramatic events in the financial markets in the last few weeks are reinforcing that view.
16253	XIN_ENG_20081010.0142.LDC2009T13	In an emergent bid to restore confidence and avoid an economic crash, the ECB abandoned its long-time hawkish policy of refusing to lower its interest rate and joined hands with the world's major central banks Wednesday by cutting its benchmark rate by 0.5 percentage points.

16277	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Members of Kenya's dominant Kikuyu tribe living in opposition strongholds feel they are paying the price for the tribal rhetoric that plagued last month's disputed elections.
16281	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"I'm not going anywhere, I was born here.
16282	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	My family came in the 1930s, they bought a piece of land, I have no relatives anywhere else," she explained.
16283	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	When Kibaki was declared the winner of the election on December 30 despite mounting evidence of fraud, several tribes turned against the Kikuyus.
16285	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Refugees were also targeted, notably when a church in Eldoret housing displaced Kikuyu families was deliberately set on fire, killing at least 35 people.
16286	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Local residents and observers have argued that in regions where feelings of marginalisation were strongest, tribal vindication was encouraged by campaigns using the long obsolete term of "majimbo".
16287	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Majimbo -- a Kiswahili term which implies a form of federalism, decentralisation and devolution -- featured in Odinga's campaign, although it was never clearly defined.
16291	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"They did not understand that the term majimbo means sharing of resources and power, brought to people on the ground," he said.
16292	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"According to them, it's cleaning and removing tribes from Kalenjin ancestral land," Stephen added, quivering because of the cold.
16294	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	Many of Eldoret's Kikuyus settled the fertile region after the 1963 independence, with the support of their leader and the country's first president Jomo Kenyatta.
16295	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	John, 44, who lives with 10,200 other people displaced by the violence in a tented camp in Eldoret, only two miles from his home, said the opposition politicians had a slogan: 'Kalenjins, with no other tribes remaining'.
16296	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	"It's not what they told the media, which was 'equal distribution of national ressources'," added John, a nurse.
16297	AFP_ENG_20080119.0274.LDC2009T13	But Reverend Maritim arap Rirei, from Eldoret's Anglican church, said that the ethnic dimension of the conflict only surfaced on the back of deeper underlying problems.

16672	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	White House officials suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week that Petraeus and Crocker would brief lawmakers in a closed session before the release of the report, congressional aides said.
16675	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	An aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., said that ``we are in talks with the administration and ... Senator Levin wants an open hearing'' with Petraeus.
16676	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Those positions only hardened Wednesday with reports that the document would not be written by the Army general but instead would come from the White House, with input from Petraeus, Crocker and other administration officials.
16679	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	``That's all the more reason why they would need to testify,'' a senior Foreign Relations Committee aide said of Petraeus and Crocker.
16681	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not cleared to speak to reporters.
16682	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The legislation says that Petraeus and Crocker ``will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of the Congress'' before the delivery of the report.
16689	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Petraeus and Crocker have said repeatedly that they plan to testify after delivering private assessments to Bush.
16693	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said that, ideally, both Crocker and Petraeus would testify before that panel.
16694	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	The Senate committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee have also requested that Rice appear at a separate hearing but have received no response.
16696	LTW_ENG_20070816.0142.LDC2009T13	Although the reports from Petraeus and Crocker are the most eagerly awaited, several other assessments are also required by the May legislation.

16703	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	SEATTLE
16704	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A Seattle-based photographer has won $1.32 million in a copyright infringement lawsuit against him by a former client, Auburn-based shoemaker Prop?t USA Inc.
16705	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	The case is believed to be the first to rule in favor of a photographer under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 federal law addressing ownership rights to digital works.
16706	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Lloyd Shugart, sole proprietor of Studio 413 in Sodo, won the federal court victory against Prop?t late last month.
16708	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, Shugart, 50, said Monday that he's exhausted after the 20-month proceeding.
16713	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	It's one of these things where the system works for a change."
16715	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart, an independent contractor, photographed Prop?t's products from about 1999 through 2005.
16716	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In 2005, Shugart claimed Prop?t was using his images in unauthorized ways by letting its international distributors and online retailers display the photos.
16717	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	To force the issue of ownership and to raise funds for a lawsuit, Shugart prepared to sell his images of Prop?t products on eBay for $1.3 million.
16718	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	But he said he never posted the ad.
16721	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	At issue was whether Prop?t had unlimited rights to use the images it had paid Shugart to produce and whether Prop?t had infringed on Shugart's copyrights.
16722	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	A jury on Sept. 27 ordered Prop?t to pay Shugart $12,800 in actual damages from copy infringement, $500,000 for damages owed under the copyright laws, $500,000 for Prop?t's removal of copyright-management information from the images and $303,000 for failing to return some original images.
16726	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	In the past, such claims have failed because they haven't shown that clients intentionally removed copyright information, he said.
16727	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	Shugart said the case's lesson for photographers is that they should register all images with the U.S. Copyright Office before releasing them to clients.
16729	NYT_ENG_20071008.0208.LDC2009T13	This is extremely important to keep in mind," he said.
16732	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	US consumer prices jumped in January, the government reported Wednesday, a week after Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned that inflation remains the central bank's top concern.
16735	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The Labor Department said the consumer price index advanced 0.2 percent last month compared to December on surging food and medical costs.
16736	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	The "core" CPI rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, went up 0.3 percent.
16741	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	But in remarks a week ago to Congress, Bernanke reiterated that inflation was the bank's predominant anxiety.
16745	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Some economists said the CPI reading was an aberration.
16747	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"That view must be qualified, however, by an unexpectedly large 0.8 percent jump in the medical care component -- the largest such reading since August 1991," he said.
16749	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Aside from rocketing healthcare costs, the CPI rate was driven up also by a 0.7 percent rise in food costs, the biggest since April 2005.
16753	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	"And investors should start asking what they should expect for long-term inflation.
16754	AFP_ENG_20070221.0575.LDC2009T13	Right now, the expectations of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent are likely too low."

17489	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And a January 2002 Justice Department memo argued that "customary international law has no binding legal effect on either the president or the military."
17490	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	In fact, as this important book, "Unchecked and Unbalanced," points out, the Bush White House has repeatedly sought to expand its powers, often doing so in secret, while sidelining both Congress and the judiciary.
17493	NYT_ENG_20070705.0126.LDC2009T13	And the administration has claimed that the president's war powers give him the authority to detain people indefinitely and deny them access to lawyers and the courts, policy that it would later be forced to modify in response to legal challenges.

17757	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Since former Mayor Giuliani began campaigning, he has sought to distance himself from Bernard Kerik and to blunt the political fallout from his relationship with his ex-police commissioner, business partner and close friend.
17758	APW_ENG_20071025.1505.LDC2009T13	Giuliani has accepted responsibility for his role in Kerik's embarrassing 2004 withdrawal as President Bush's Homeland Security nominee amid tax problems.

18070	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	It turns out that "The Eye," this month's homely Hollywood remake of an Asian horror film, could credibly double as one of those feminine sixth-sense TV dramas.
18071	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Jessica Alba stars as Sydney Wells, a chic blind violinist whose sight is restored in a cornea transplant.
18072	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Suddenly, those blurring images she's seeing are trying to tell her something - and no, it's not, "Get a new agent."
18073	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She's meant to see fires, hear voices, and be lunged at by testy apparitions who leave handprints in spilled sugar.

18080	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top.
18081	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	But we've been here before, no?
18087	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She could give Jennifer Love Hewitt ("Ghost Whisperer") a run for her money in the girlishness department.

18097	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	or Rachel Ticotin, in a small part (where's she been?)
18098	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	as, well, some unhappy Mexican lady.
18099	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	They all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.
18101	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	As a performer, Alba still seems to be figuring out what she's good at.
18106	NYT_ENG_20080202.0017.LDC2009T13	She had little to say and little to wear, but she'd found her calling as a good-hearted mermaid.

18116	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	A secret grand jury is meeting in Newark to decide whether to indict Posada on charges of financing a terrorist operation.

18120	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The American government has the information necessary to charge Posada," he said.
18124	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	The ruling thrilled anti-Castro Cubans in Florida, and turned frustration among Cubans on the island into rage over the Americans' failure to indict Posada for terrorism.
18126	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	"The prosecution never charged him for being what he is -- a terrorist," the Communist Party newspaper Granma declared.
18127	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	But lawyers say there's a good chance that Posada will wind up being tried in New Jersey.

18133	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	He went to Venezuela in 1967, became a citizen and worked in the country's intelligence services.
18134	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	Escaping after serving nine years in a Venezuelan prison, he wound up in El Salvador where he took part in the Iran-Contra arms operation run by Lt. Col Oliver North before he was arrested in Panama in 2000.
18142	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	U.S. Justice Department officials won't discuss the secret proceedings.
18145	APW_ENG_20070510.1782.LDC2009T13	During the 1999 Cuban trial of two Salvadorans in the bombings, prosecutors said Posada organized and financed the attacks, recruiting the bombers in Central America and paying about US$4,500 for each mission.

18196	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	This is the second time that two teams with the best goal record meet in the Final.
18197	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	In 1999, China (19 goals) met hosts USA (18) but subsequently neither of them managed to find the net in 120 minutes.
18198	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Germany could become the first team to win two consecutive titles in a FIFA women's competition: no World Cup winner or Olympic Gold medal winner has ever managed to defend the title.
18199	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	For Germany, this is the the third FIFA Women's World Cup Final and their fourth overall (Germany won the 2004 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Thailand).
18200	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Brazil play their first FIFA Women's World Cup Final.
18201	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	They finished 3rd in 1999 and lost the 2004 Olympic Final.
18202	XIN_ENG_20070930.0121.LDC2009T13	Germany hold yet another record as they have not conceded a goal for 529 minutes.

18214	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	US President George W. Bush Thursday signed a law expanding legal authority for wiretaps by spy agencies which he hailed as vital for America's security, after a fierce Congress battle.
18217	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The law includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, meeting a key White House demand.
18219	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	Senators finally voted Wednesday 69 to 28 to pass the measure, after blocking several attempts to water down the immunity for telecom firms.
18220	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"Almost seven years have passed since that September morning when nearly 3,000 men, women, and children were murdered in our midst," Bush said.
18221	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	"The attack changed our country forever.
18222	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	We realized America was a nation at war.
18228	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The program, revealed in 2005, caused public outcry and opponents argued that US privacy guarantees meant the intelligence agencies should seek court warrants from the FISA court to conduct such spying inside the country.
18231	AFP_ENG_20080710.0068.LDC2009T13	The new law, however, gives the agency a week, and it also allows them to use any information they got even if the FISA court eventually rules that the wiretap is unlawful.

18234	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Two FedEx jets got too close to each other on takeoff from the Memphis airport last week because of confusion over flight numbers for the planes, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said.
18235	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	The incident, which the FAA classified as serious, air traffic control error, remained under investigation.
18237	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Kathleen Bergen, an FAA spokeswoman in Atlanta, disagreed Thursday.
18242	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	Bergen said the flights had similar numbers -- 527 and 257 -- that caused confusion sending one plane on a wrong turn shortly after they took off at the same time on separate runways.
18244	APW_ENG_20080229.0273.LDC2009T13	FAA rules require pilots to read back flight instructions and for controllers to make sure they were properly received.

18250	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Diagnosed cases of cancer rose by 10 percent in Europe over two years, an increase attributable to the continent's ageing population, the effects of smoking and better screening for breast cancer, doctors reported on Wednesday.
18251	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	In 2006, there were 3.2 million new cases of cancer in 39 European countries, compared with 2.9 million in 2004, they said.
18252	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	For the first time, breast cancer overtook lung cancer as the commonest diagnosed cancer, with 429,000 new cases in 2006, or nearly one in seven of the total.
18254	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	Lung cancer, though, remains the biggest killer, accounting for 334,800 out of the 1.7 million cancer deaths in Europe in 2006.
18257	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"The overwhelming majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco smoking," said IARC director Peter Boyle.
18258	AFP_ENG_20070206.0617.LDC2009T13	"Tobacco control is clearly a number one priority in Europe, not only aimed at men, particularly the male populations of Central and Eastern Europe, but increasingly targeted towards women, especially in Northern Europe."

18264	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	While publicly the opposition has not changed stance, its calls for Ishiba's head have cooled this week, which media reports attributed to a request from the victims' family.
18271	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	But on Wednesday the Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted a senior official of the main opposition Democratic Party saying: "We won't be able to get public support for demanding him to resign under the current circumstances."
18272	AFP_ENG_20080306.0635.LDC2009T13	The opposition took control of the upper house last year and has repeatedly seized on scandals to demand fresh general elections.
18277	XIN_ENG_20070923.0182.LDC2009T13	When the plan is completed, the exchange floor will be half the size it was at its peak.

18295	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Israeli military intelligence has reported recently that Syria was reinforcing troops at its border with the occupied Golan Heights, but these "are of a defensive character aimed against a possible Israeli attack," the radio said.
18296	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Committee chairman Tsahi Hanegbi said: "It is important that there are no aggressive declarations from our side that can be misunderstood" by the Syrian leadership.
18298	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Earlier this month, Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said that Syria and Hezbollah, with which the Jewish state fought a 34-day war last summer, feared a possible attack by Israel if the United States attacks Iran.
18300	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	Although Yadlin insisted Israel had no intention of becoming embroiled in such a conflict, he warned that any moves by the Jewish state could be wrongly interpreted by its neighbours as a sign of hostile intent.
18301	AFP_ENG_20070418.0217.LDC2009T13	"If the Americans launch an offensive in Iran, Hezbollah and Syria will think the move had been coordinated with Israel and would expect Israel to strike them too," another government official at the meeting told AFP.

18306	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Jubeir, also a former spokesman at the embassy in Washington, replaces Prince Turki al-Faisal who resigned abruptly in December for what he said were family reasons.
18310	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	When Prince Turki flew home after only 15 months in the crucial diplomatic post, a source at the Saudi embassy said he had left after telling staff he was quitting because he wanted to spend more time with his family.
18312	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	Prince Turki made a series of speeches last year urging Washington not to withdraw its troops from Iraq precipitously, and repeatedly urged the White House to try to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
18314	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	He also spent 25 years as the head of Saudi Arabia's intelligence service.
18315	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	In the 1980s, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Prince Turki worked closely with Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in organising Muslim volunteers to join the Afghan insurgency.
18318	AFP_ENG_20070129.0392.LDC2009T13	The lawsuit was dismissed in 2003.
18321	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Disney has struggled to make money in India, which has a vast domestic film market, with its "American fare," but believes that an animated story featuring the voices of well-known Indian film stars could be a commercial hit, the report said.
18329	AFP_ENG_20070611.0321.LDC2009T13	Production costs are usually cheaper in India than in the United States, the Journal pointed out.
18334	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Researchers asked patients to recall what their doctors told them about their diagnosis and cause, emergency department care, post-emergency department care, and return instructions.
18336	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	The biggest source of confusion: what they were supposed to do when they left the hospital.
18341	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"This confirms what we've been suspecting for a while," he said.
18342	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	In response to those concerns, the hospital is now rewriting discharge instructions and uses nurses - instead of doctors - to slowly and carefully walk patients through what they should do when they get home.
18343	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	Another important aspect of the paper was the degree to which patients either weren't aware - or weren't willing to admit - that they didn't understand instructions from doctors, Engel said.
18344	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"If they have a deficit, the vast majority - four out of five - of these people are not going to tell us they have a problem," she said.
18346	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	While the study's design is sound, its small size and limited area - two hospitals within 15 minutes of each other - makes it hard to generalize to patients throughout the country, said Dr. Richard Bachur, chief of emergency services at Children's Hospital Boston.
18347	NYT_ENG_20080721.0096.LDC2009T13	"The design was very nice, and the journal that it's in is, to me, the premiere journal in emergency medicine," he said.

18397	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	Strong winds and prevailing currents have spread the oil slick to an area about 1 mile (2 kilometers) wide and 10 miles (20 kilometers) in length, Jung said.
18399	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The Coast Guard planned to mobilize 103 vessels and six helicopters Saturday in an effort to clean it up, Jung said, adding that the operation was expected to take at least three days.
18400	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	"We're doing our best to remove the contamination as quickly as possible, but it will take some time to clean up the shore because it needs to be done by hand," said Kim Woon-tae, a Coast Guard official stationed in the region.
18404	APW_ENG_20071208.0166.LDC2009T13	The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.

18416	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Cox News Service
18418	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	The announcement came at a Des Moines news conference initially planned to announce the counterpunch ad, which Huckabee still managed to get some mileage out of - without buying air time - by showing it in a room packed with reporters and cameras.
18419	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a huge gamble on my part.
18420	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	We'll see how it turns out," Huckabee said in killing the ad, noting that "conventional political wisdom is when you are hit and it is beginning to do damage the smart play is to hit back."
18421	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"His ads are hurting me," he said, adding that if failing to fight back with negative ads costs him the presidency "then I'll probably be the last guy to ever do this."
18424	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Romney's Iowa ads aggressively challenge Huckabee's record as Arkansas governor, including the large number of inmates he pardoned.
18425	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Huckabee said Monday the ads have been effective, reflected in poll numbers showing his recent fall from surprising frontrunner status in Iowa.
18427	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	But last week, the same poll showed Romney four points up on Huckabee, who was second.
18428	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	At a campaign stop in Independence, Iowa, Romney said Huckabee's news conference "is confusing to the people of Iowa."
18429	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"On the one hand, he wants to run a positive campaign
18430	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	and on the other hand, he shows a negative campaign ad and hopes that people promote it and provide it to the public through the earned media.
18435	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	It made several points about Romney, including his previous support for gun control and a health-care plan that included a co-payment for abortions.
18439	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"It's a little bit of trying to stay above the fray while kicking up a little bit of mud, if not throwing it," he said.
18441	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama and Edwards each were at 26 percent.
18443	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	A previous poll last week had Clinton at 31, Obama at 27 and Edwards at 24.
18445	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Spencer on Monday, he sharpened his anti- Washington rhetoric and alluded to his momentum, saying, "There's lots of excitement, clearly good things are happening and there's a lot of energy and momentum here in Iowa."
18449	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Get the job done," she said about battles in Washington.
18450	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	"Instead of generating a lot of heat, rolling your hands and jumping up and down, sit down and figure out how we're going to beat them."
18451	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	For a change, Clinton largely ignored Obama and the tempest brewing over his recent jabs that her world affairs experience as first lady amounted to chatting over tea.
18456	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	Obama spent part of Monday concentrating on turnout.
18457	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In Marion County, he beckoned two of his local organizers to the stage and said, "Their job is to get you to the caucus.
18458	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	My job is to be so persuasive that you conclude 'I've got to go for Obama.
18459	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	That's my guy."'
18460	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	All three Democrats found themselves negatively depicted in a last-minute round of phone calls to likely caucus-goers in Iowa.
18461	NYT_ENG_20071231.0111.LDC2009T13	In each case, recipients told the Associated Press that a caller pretending to conduct a poll of candidate preferences began by asking who the caucus-goer intends to support.

18483	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Such was a snapshot of the daily training of the Chinese synchronized swimmer twins, Jiang Wenwen and Jiang Tingting, from southwest China's Sichuan province.
18484	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The girls' hometown was hit by a major earthquake in May in which more than 80,000 were dead or missing.
18485	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The sisters were in Beijing when the earthquake occurred and their families in Sichuan were unharmed.

18487	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	We are training hard so that we can have good achievements to comfort them," said Wenwen.
18488	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Training nine to 10 hours in the water during the day, the 22 -year-old are among Chinese best synchro swimmers and will lead China's medal quest at the Beijing Olympics.
18490	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Japan, Spain and Canada are also strong in the sport.
18493	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Months later, the swimmers made a historical fourth in team and duet competitions in the 2007 Melbourne World Championships.
18495	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"We are more sure of ourselves after these competitions.

18498	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The added weight helped them to improve strength and stability in water.
18499	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	The girls said they were grateful for their coach Imura for their achievements.
18500	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	"She is a very stringent coach, but she also takes very good care of us," said Wenwen at the April tournament.
18501	XIN_ENG_20080718.0237.LDC2009T13	Imura, 58, has coached Japan's synchro swimming team since 1978, helping her swimmers win eight Olympic medals over the past 30 years.

18507	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Native American Cherokees voted to expel descendants of black slaves from their tribe nation in a special election that has prompted charges of racism, according to returns made public early Sunday.
18508	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	But a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma adopted Saturday an amendment to their constitution that strips membership from so- called "Freedmen," those descended from slaves once owned by Cherokees, blacks who were married to Cherokees and children of mixed-race families.
18510	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	"Their voice is clear as to who should be citizens of the Cherokee Nation.
18511	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	No one else has the right to make that determination."
18516	AFP_ENG_20070304.0145.LDC2009T13	Advocates of changing the 141-year-old treaty rules defining who is a Cherokee say the tribal nation has a sovereign right to decide citizenship and that other tribes base membership on blood lines.

18527	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The phone rang, and it was answered by a Kurdish security commander, Hallo Najat, sitting in his office in this deeply divided city.
18528	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	On the line, he said, was a U.N. official wanting to know whether it was true that the Kurdish militia, the pesh merga, had left its bases in northern Iraq and was occupying Kirkuk.
18532	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"What is the need for the troops?"
18540	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Asaish officers are often the first to the scene of an attack and, other Kurdish officials concede, seem always to have the best intelligence.
18541	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The leaders of the Asaish report only to the dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
18545	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	At some point, the Turkmen guards inside fired at the crowd.
18546	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All in all, U.S. officials say they believe, far more people were killed and wounded in the riot than in the bombing that touched it off.
18547	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Yet, while the police quickly arrested 13 Turkmens at the headquarters, charging them with firing on the crowd, they did not apprehend any of the Kurds who burned the building.
18548	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One of the Turkmen guards wounded in the fighting was quickly interrogated at the hospital by the Asaish and the police.
18551	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But the senior Turkmen on the force, Maj. Gen. Turhan Abdul-Rahman Youssef, fears a whitewash.
18553	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds' accumulation of power has stoked tensions with Arabs and Turkmens.
18556	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs also say the Asaish carry out kidnappings, a charge Asaish officers deny.
18557	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But rival ethnic leaders also warn that the Kurds' control of the security forces will not prevent chaos in the event of an outbreak of ethnic fighting.
18560	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kurdish militiamen reversed the process, driving out Arabs and bringing in Kurds.
18561	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Arabs and Turkmens now make up about 40 percent of Kirkuk's population, according to U.S. military estimates.
18562	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The Kurds want to fold Kirkuk into the neighboring Kurdistan region.
18565	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	After the suicide bombing, that conflict was evident in a dispute about whether to bring a substantial number of Iraqi troops into the city, in a direct challenge to Kurdish supremacy.
18570	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Aware that part of the proposal being debated in Baghdad was to send a far larger force from central and southern Iraq to administer security -- which would mean a mostly Arab force, loyal to the Baghdad government, set against Kurdish-controlled forces -- the Kurds objected strenuously.
18571	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Kurds were not the only ones opposing the deployment of a major Arab security force after the July 28 violence.
18576	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	But he said it was difficult to comprehend the level of mistrust.
18579	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	The severity of those tensions became indisputably clear three weeks ago when thousands of Kurds poured into central Kirkuk to protest the power-sharing proposal in Baghdad.
18580	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	In a video that U.S. commanders say they believe to be authentic, a young man who the Americans say appears to be the bomber can be seen standing in a sea of demonstrators.
18581	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	He ritualistically raises his hands, palms up, toward his face, then lowers them to his side.
18584	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	One mistook a well-known Kurdish journalist, Yahya Barzanji, for a Turkmen correspondent, shouting, "He's working for the Turkmens," Barzanji recalled.
18585	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	A video captured the crowd furiously beating Barzanji, chanting: "Kill him!
18588	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	While U.S. and Kurdish officials agree that the Turkmen guards fired into the crowd, Paschal -- who watched the skirmish unfold in a video feed from a remotely piloted aerial drone -- said that the Turkmens did not appear to fire wantonly, and that they instead gradually escalated until they were firing directly into a large and growing mob that posed a threat.
18589	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	All told, at least 28 people died and 213 were wounded in the suicide attack and the ensuing riot, according to the Asaish commander at the main hospital.
18591	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Paschal said attacks in Kirkuk had dropped by two-thirds since last summer.
18596	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	Rifat Abdullah, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan here, said: "The Asaish have lots of sources, and that's why the Americans depend on them and the police depend on them.
18599	NYT_ENG_20080818.0153.LDC2009T13	"They have a major role combating terrorism, but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties," he said.

18631	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	That gave Busch an opening on a restart.
18634	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	Earlier in the race, Johnson appeared on his way to turning the playoff chase into a one-man race.
18638	NYT_ENG_20071014.0071.LDC2009T13	He moved up to sixth place before falling back on the restart with five laps remaining.

18723	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	China State Councilor Hua Jianmin said on Monday that he hopes Intel Corporation will expand even further its cooperation with Chinese companies after the American computer chip giant officially announced plans to build a 2.5-billion-U.S.-dollar plant in northeast China.
18724	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Hua made the remarks at a meeting with President and Chief Executive Officer of Intel, Paul Otellini.
18725	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	The two sides exchanged views on expanding cooperation in the information industry.
18726	XIN_ENG_20070326.0046.LDC2009T13	Intel announced it will build a huge new plant in Dalian, a port city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.

18736	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The results of further tests done to determine if the Limpopo river is contaminated with cholera are expected by Saturday.
18737	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	South African government spokesman Themba Maseko told a media briefing in Pretoria on Friday that the department of water and forestry in Limpopo had increased its surveillance and monitoring of all rivers in the northern Limpopo.
18739	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	he said.
18741	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said the national regulation unit was also monitoring areas close to the Zimbabwean border -- the origin of contamination -- to determine the health of the communities of Musina and Madibo.
18742	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	Samples taken, which include raw sewage, would indicate whether cholera is present in waste water.
18743	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	"Further tests will help determine whether potable water quality has deteriorated since the last round of sampling," Maseko said.
18745	XIN_ENG_20081205.0104.LDC2009T13	He said it was not clear when the results for the river, which serves communities in Madombo and Masisi, would be released.

18843	APW_ENG_20081021.0609.LDC2009T13	Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 6.2 percent to $6.56 billion, boosted by 26 percent sales growth in Latin America.
18844	APW_ENG_20081021.0609.LDC2009T13	The results beat analysts' average forecast for adjusted profit of $1.38 per share, though revenue was slightly shy of their $6.65 billion estimate, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.
18848	APW_ENG_20081021.0609.LDC2009T13	The dollar's weakness against other major currencies boosted 3M's sales growth in the quarter by 2.1 percentage points.
18851	APW_ENG_20081021.0609.LDC2009T13	This is slightly revised from prior guidance for 10 percent growth.
18858	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	That decision had been widely expected given an economy that is exhibiting better-than-expected growth.
18859	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been expected to start cutting rates later this year, economists are now worried that the central bank may feel the need to resume raising rates for fear that inflation pressures will not keep easing.
18861	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	At the previous four meetings, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed regional bank, had dissented in favor of a further boost in rates.
18863	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The action means that banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans, will remain unchanged at 8.25 percent.
18864	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	While the Fed had been widely expected to leave rates unchanged for a fifth straight meeting, there are growing concerns its next move could be to raise rates, given a string of indicators showing stronger-than-expected growth.
18866	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	In a brief statement explaining its actions, the Fed said, "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market."
18868	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues followed up that comment by repeating its belief that the panel "judges that some inflation risks remain."
18869	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	It said that the extent of any future rate hikes will depend on how the prospects for inflation and economic growth evolve in coming months, repeating the language it has been using at previous meetings.
18871	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	Many analysts have gone from forecasting that the Fed would cut rates possibly three times this year to thinking that the most likely outcome is that the Fed will leave rates steady for a considerable period.
18876	APW_ENG_20070131.1568.LDC2009T13	The Fed is hoping to engineer a "soft landing" in which the economy slows and inflation pressures are lowered but the slackening of business activity does not spell recession.

19045	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The tremor made buildings in Tokyo sway and was also felt in northern and central Japan.
19046	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	The agency initially measured the quake at a 6.6 magnitude, but later revised that up to 6.8.
19049	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Koichi Uhira of the Meteorological Agency warned that the aftershocks could continue for a week.
19053	APW_ENG_20070716.0257.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, campaigning in southern Japan for parliamentary elections later this month, was to return to Tokyo to deal with the quake, and the government has set up a task force, reports said.

19063	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	The apology came two days after the UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent genocide by Bosnian Serb forces during the Srebrenica massacre.

19077	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In July 2005, Serbian President Boris Tadic attended a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre in Srebrenica to pay his respects to the victims.
19080	AFP_ENG_20070228.0495.LDC2009T13	In 2005, a motion to adopt such an apology failed in the Serbian parliament because parties could not agree whether it should single out Srebrenica or include crimes committed by all sides, as demanded by nationalists.

19160	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Osama bin Laden will release a new video in the coming days ahead of the sixth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in what would be the first new images of the terror mastermind in nearly three years, al-Qaida's media arm announced.
19161	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Analysts noted that al-Qaida tends to mark the Sept. 11 anniversary with a slew of messages, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday it had no credible information warning of an imminent threat to the United States.
19163	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The al-Qaida leader has not appeared in new video footage since October 2004, and he has not put out a new audiotape in more than a year, his longest period without a message.
19164	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	One difference in his appearance was immediately obvious.
19165	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The announcement had a still photo from the coming video, showing bin Laden addressing the camera, his beard fully black.
19174	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	"They've always gone out of their way to commemorate it," said Ben Venzke, chief executive officer of IntelCenter.
19180	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	But he said increased activity overseas and recent arrests of militants in Germany reinforce the department's assessment that the country is currently in a period of increased risk.
19181	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The White House said a new video message from bin Laden would only underscore the threat the United States and other nations face from extremists.
19184	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	In that appearance three years ago, he said America could avoid another Sept. 11 style attack if it stopped threatening Muslims.
19185	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	The new video would also end the longest period bin Laden has gone without releasing a message.
19187	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	Bin Laden went silent for a similar long stretch before -- from Dec. 28, 2004 to Jan. 19, 2006.
19190	APW_ENG_20070907.0177.LDC2009T13	U.S. officials have repeatedly said over the past year they believe the al-Qaida leader is alive.

19237	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The impact of higher food prices is particularly marked in poor countries where 75 percent of a family's revenues go on food, compared to rich countries where just 15 percent of a household's income is spent on meals.
19238	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	A drop in school attendance is already being observed in Nepal, said World Food Programme spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume.
19239	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The country is particularly vulnerable as it depends on food imports from China and India, which are restricting exports, said Berthiaume.
19242	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	"They prefer to sell elsewhere at a higher price," said Berthiaume.
19244	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	Food security has become a major concern in recent weeks as supplies of basic commodities have dwindled in the face of soaring demand, triggering riots and outbreaks of violence from Haiti to Indonesia.
19245	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	The World Bank on Sunday said a doubling of food prices over the past three years could push 100 million people in developing countries further into poverty.
19246	AFP_ENG_20080415.0388.LDC2009T13	It urged developed nations to step up and tackle the issue.

19282	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Almost two years earlier, Bility, a journalist imprisoned and tortured by the regime of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, had fled Africa for Boston and heeded a resettlement official's advice to become a Red Sox fan.
19283	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Now he was spending his days testifying against rebel leaders being tried by a United Nations court for war crimes and helping prosecutors gather evidence against Taylor.
19284	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	At night he watched baseball with court officers from New Jersey who were cheering the pinstripes.
19288	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	In his native Monrovia, he was editor in chief of The Analyst, a newspaper that regularly reported on the violence and abuses of Taylor's presidency, both in Liberia and in the arms- for-diamonds war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
19289	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He was one of the most outspoken and courageous journalists in Liberia," says Joshua Rubenstein, New England director of Amnesty International.
19290	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Today Bility, 38, lives in a third-floor walk-up in Chelsea with his wife and two sons, and he expects to testify against Taylor, who is on trial in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone.
19291	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"My concentration," Bility says, "has been to bring to justice people who have abused people in Sierra Leone and Liberia."
19292	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility is a soft-spoken man, dressed in crisp white pants and plaid shirt, his graying hair shaved close.
19293	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He suffers hearing loss in his left ear after being beaten badly in 1997 during his first arrest.
19294	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	His elbows bear scars from the aftermath of his seventh and final arrest: For six months in 2002 his jailers often tied his elbows behind his back until they touched each other
19295	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	the tightened rope dug a groove so deep into his skin Bility could slide a finger inside.
19297	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He is a reluctant refugee, the subject of an international campaign for his release by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the US government.
19303	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor was president of Liberia from his election in 1997 until his exile to Nigeria in 2003.
19305	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor arrived in Boston in 1972 and lived here for a decade while studying economics at Chamberlayne Junior College in Newton and Bentley College in Waltham.
19307	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He escaped from the Plymouth House of Corrections in 1985 while awaiting extradition.
19311	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I thought the Liberian media wasn't reporting what was happening, either from fear or censorship," he says.
19312	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"I felt it was necessary for somebody to stand up and report what was real."
19313	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	During this period of chaos, West African peacekeepers managed to ring off the capital city of Monrovia, says Binaifer Nowrojee, former legal counsel for Human Rights Watch Africa.
19315	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Hassan came out of that moment in time," she says.
19316	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"In the human rights community he was very much a household name."
19319	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"That issue was taboo," Bility recalls.
19323	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	That was the battle line."
19325	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Taylor's government took over The National in 1998, and Bility, who had been arrested two other times by then, moved to The Analyst.
19327	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Twice the government closed the paper for at least a month, and four more times Bility was arrested, the latest on June 24, 2002.
19329	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	They blindfolded him, beat him, and took him to Taylor's home, Bility recalls.
19330	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Charles Taylor introduced me.
19333	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	There are several chairs and sofas around, but everybody is sitting on the floor.
19336	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A minister said, 'What are you doing?
19337	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Do you compare yourself to the president?"'
19340	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He describes months of being starved and beaten and stomped, of having electric shock applied to his genitals.
19341	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	A guard offered him a cigarette, and he's been a smoker ever since.
19342	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Once, when he was sitting in a room with government agents who had been drinking, one, a renowned marksman, poured Scotch down Bility's throat, then balanced the Dewar's bottle on the blindfolded prisoner's head.
19343	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The marksman shot the bottle, and glass rained down on Bility.
19344	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"If I had a heart condition," Bility says, "my blood would have exploded from my head."
19346	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"A flock of sparrows flew overhead," Bility says.
19347	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"He looked up and said, 'My birds.'
19350	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"People," he says simply, "believe what I say is true."
19352	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Until then I thought I would die," Bility says.
19353	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"From that day on I had hope."
19359	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"There was no way Taylor would kill me," he says.
19360	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"Once the US government was involved and Amnesty was involved, there was no way."
19362	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	American resettlement officials suggested he would like Washington or Boston.
19363	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He had had enough of capital cities.
19368	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	I was completely traumatized.
19370	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"What helped me was to speak about it.
19371	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	The more I spoke about it, the less stressful it became, and things became normal."
19372	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Like many other Liberians, Bility is hopeful that President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will bring progress.
19373	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	Bility wants more, however.
19374	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	He wants Taylor held accountable not only for the atrocities he committed in Sierra Leone but also for those he committed in Liberia.
19375	NYT_ENG_20070625.0073.LDC2009T13	"You cannot build a viable democracy," he says, "without justice being the solid foundation."

19389	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday that President George W. Bush asked the United Nations to increase its presence and role in Iraq but he told the U.S. leader the U.N.'s operations in the country are limited by security concerns.
19390	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban, who took over as U.N. chief on Jan. 1, said the United Nations would, nonetheless, try to increase its role in furthering the International Compact for Iraq, a five-year plan to ensure that Iraq's government has funds to survive and enact key political and economic reforms.
19391	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban spoke to reporters on his return from Washington where he held talks with Bush at the White House on Tuesday and met Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, later in the day and on Wednesday morning.
19393	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	He said he was "very much encouraged" that Bush pledged continued U.S. support and participation "in all areas of U.N. activities," and welcomed the "very strong support and warm reception by Congressional leaders."

19398	APW_ENG_20070117.1688.LDC2009T13	Ban was asked about his discussion with Bush on Iraq and his response.

19560	LTW_ENG_20070823.0072.LDC2009T13	As the popularity of the carry trade grew, central bankers fretted that the availability of cheap yen was artificially lowering the price of risk.

19838	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	NEW YORK 2008-03-31 22:01:06 UTC
19840	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In a major change, the American Heart Association said Monday that hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- rapid, deep presses on the victim's chest until help arrives -- works just as well as standard CPR for sudden cardiac arrest in adults.
19843	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hands-only CPR calls for uninterrupted chest presses -- 100 a minute -- until paramedics take over or an automated external defibrillator is available to restore a normal heart rhythm.
19844	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	This action should be taken only for adults who unexpectedly collapse, stop breathing and are unresponsive.
19846	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	In such a case, the victim still has ample air in the lungs and blood and compressions keep blood flowing to the brain, heart and other organs.
19848	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	That also applies to adults who suffer lack of oxygen from a near-drowning, drug overdose, or carbon monoxide poisoning.
19851	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The CPR guidelines had been inching toward compression-only.
19852	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	The last update, in 2005, put more emphasis on chest pushes by alternating 30 presses with two quick breaths
19855	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Those who have been trained in traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation can still opt to use it.
19858	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	An estimated 310,000 Americans die each year of cardiac arrest.
19864	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Ewy said there is no point to giving early breaths in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, and it takes too long to stop compressions to give two breaths -- 16 seconds for the average person.
19865	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He noted that victims often gasp periodically anyway, drawing in a little air on their own.
19868	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"It's not only the yuck factor."
19871	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	It's less complicated and the outcomes are better," said Dallas emergency medical services chief Dr. Paul Pepe, who also chairs emergency medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
19873	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad, 40, had read about it in a medical journal and used it on Garth Goodall, who collapsed while working out at their gym in February.
19874	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad's 15-year-old son Josh called paramedics in the meantime.
19875	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	Hjelmstad said he pumped on Goodall's chest for more than 12 minutes -- encouraged by Goodall's intermittent gasps -- until paramedics arrived.
19876	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	He was thrilled to find out the next day that Goodall had survived.
19879	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was just fortunate enough to be there."
19881	APW_ENG_20080331.1340.LDC2009T13	"I was lucky," he said.

19917	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	Montaner noted that the drug users who were prescribed AIDS drugs were just as likely to use them as those whose infections arose from other sources.
19918	LTW_ENG_20080804.0027.LDC2009T13	But he cautioned that the injection drug users are less likely to receive a prescription in the first place, so that their overall death rate will remain higher.

19921	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Fans who are in town Saturday for Louisiana State's home opener against Virginia Tech can get a glimpse of LSU's latest recruits -- football players and a tiger mascot.
19922	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Mike VI, a 2-year old Bengal-Siberian tiger who is expected to grow to 700 pounds, was acquired in August from an animal-rescue center in Indiana.
19923	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The tiger was placed on view on Sept. 1 in a $2.9 million, 15,000 -square-foot campus habitat equipped with a wading pool, a waterfall, scratching posts, air-conditioned sleeping quarters and around-the-clock care from the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine.

19927	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	But not everyone agrees.
19928	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The university and the state are on the skirmish lines of a growing fight waged by animal- rights groups, lawmakers and courts to bar the use of animals as live mascots, for staging fights or even in certain types of sporting equipment.
19931	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	PETA argued that tigers need to roam over hundreds of miles, not square feet, and that wild animals become stressed in stadiums filled with tens of thousands of people.
19932	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Meanwhile, in June, Louisiana became the 50th state to ban cockfighting.
19936	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"These are manifestations of increasing concern about well-being and the ethic that if you are going to use animals, there should be a compelling reason," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.
19942	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Louisiana state Sen. Arthur J. Lentini of Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, led the effort in Louisiana to ban cockfighting, in which roosters are fitted with spikes for slashing duels.
19943	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Some Louisiana legislators said that cockfighting was a Cajun tradition and a rural economic lifeline.
19944	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Lentini said, "I felt it was very detrimental to the image of this state to be the only remaining state that permitted this activity in which animals are hurt for the amusement and wagering of human beings."
19945	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The ban takes effect in August 2008.
19947	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	In July, the California Supreme Court banned the sale of kangaroo-skin shoes in settling a lawsuit.
19948	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Response to the court decision has been mixed.
19950	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	A bill that would permit products made from kangaroo hides is pending in the California Legislature.
19952	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The Vick case, too, has come to be viewed by some in a more nuanced way.
19959	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Southeastern Louisiana University, located east of here in Hammond, once housed a live lion during football season in an arrangement with the Audubon Zoo of New Orleans.
19966	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	"As grandiose as Mike's expensive habitat may look, it is inadequate for a tiger.
19967	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	The whole idea of carting this animal to a sporting event with screaming people is stressful to any wild animal."
19968	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Previously, PETA and other animal-rights groups criticized the conditions in which Baylor University kept a pair of black bear mascots.
19971	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	Cockfighting is "certainly not condoned by the university," Russ McKinney, a South Carolina spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
19972	NYT_ENG_20070907.0252.LDC2009T13	He said the school had a strong connection to the term Gamecock, which was the nickname given to a leader of the state's resistance to the British during the Revolutionary War.

20073	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	That reversal of fortune mirrored what has happened in Manning's life over the past 10 months.
20074	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Last April, within days of receiving a contract offer from the Bears, Manning was arrested and charged with assault after an incident at a Denny's restaurant in Los Angeles.
20075	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Manning has acknowledged getting into an argument with a customer and pushing him in the head before leaving.
20076	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	After the news of his latest arrest became public, the Carolina Panthers declined to match the Bears' five-year, $21 million offer for Manning, who was a restricted free agent.
20079	NYT_ENG_20070115.0224.LDC2009T13	Intent on putting his past behind him, Manning pleaded no contest to a felony assault in the fall and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of anger-management counseling and 100 hours of community service.

20145	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Asked in a recent interview if he agreed with Podhoretz that the time to bomb Iran has already come, Giuliani said: "From the information I do have available, which is all public source material, I would say that that is not correct, we are not at that stage at this point.
20146	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Can we get to that stage?
20147	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Yes.
20148	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	And is that stage closer than some of the Democrats believe?
20151	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	But Giuliani has distanced himself somewhat from what was once a central neoconservative tenet, the belief that the United States could spread democracy through the Middle East.
20154	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Aspiring dictators sometimes win elections, and elected leaders sometimes govern badly and threaten their neighbors."
20155	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Neoconservatives said they were generally supportive of Giuliani's positions and saw them as being in line with those taken by the other leading Republican presidential candidates.
20158	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	The emerging Giuliani doctrine, which is being created through conference calls, policy papers, and seminar-like meetings, contains a number of main elements.
20160	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	He takes a dim view of the United Nations, which he sees as good for little other than humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, but wants to expand NATO and invite Israel to join it.
20162	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	If there is a central tenet to his thinking, it may be that the United States must project strength to keep itself safe.
20163	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	"Weakness invites attack," Giuliani warned to cheers in a speech he gave recently to the Republican Jewish Coalition.
20165	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	In the Foreign Affairs article, he wrote that it might be advisable at times to hold serious diplomatic talks with the nation's adversaries, but not with "those bent on our destruction or those who cannot deliver on their agreements."
20170	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Aides to Giuliani dismiss any comparison to the briefings Bush received when he was the governor of Texas, and a procession of experts -- who called themselves Vulcans, after the Greek god of the forge -- visited him in Austin to school him on policy.
20171	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Giuliani, these aides said, already had a broad vision of what he wanted to do.
20173	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Hill had never met Giuliani when he was summoned to a 45-minute meeting at the office of Giuliani Partners in late February -- a meeting that stretched to nearly three hours.
20176	NYT_ENG_20071024.0190.LDC2009T13	Instead of talking about "the war on terror," Giuilani speaks of "the terrorists' war on us," or, as he put it in a recent speech to a group of conservative Christians, the "Islamic terrorists' war against the United States."

20189	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Their company was based in the Isle of Man and traded on the London Stock Exchange.
20190	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	Some experts initially believed that Neteller's offshore status put it beyond the reach of U.S. law.
20196	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He said Lawrence intended to return to his home in the Bahamas until his sentencing, which has been scheduled for October.
20198	APW_ENG_20070630.0255.LDC2009T13	He faced a statutory maximum of five years, but any punishment is likely to be reduced by his cooperation in the case.

20291	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush's plan, unveiled Wednesday, called, on the contrary, for a "surge" of 21,500 more troops to Iraq while boosting military efforts to isolate the regimes in Tehran and Damascus.
20292	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The decision to deepen US involvement in the unpopular war while foregoing diplomacy drew scathing criticism not only from opposition Democrats but also from some leaders of Bush's Republican party.
20294	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	His Republican colleague, Charles Hagel, called Bush's plan "the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam."
20298	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Bush was cool to the recommendations from the beginning and some commentators saw his plan as an outright repudiation of the Baker report.
20299	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	"From where I sit, Madam Secretary, you are not listening to the American people, you are not listening to the military ... you are not listening to the Iraq Study Group," Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer fumed at Rice Thursdsay.
20300	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	The strategy released by Bush however reflected key elements of the Baker outline, including a need to boost training of Iraqi forces by "embedding" more US advisors and making US support conditional on Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government meeting "benchmarks" for achieving security and political reconciliation.
20302	AFP_ENG_20070112.0082.LDC2009T13	Rice met another of the group's main recommendations Thursday when she named a "czar" to oversee a new, more decentralised push for economic reconstruction and job creation in Iraq.

20312	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Venezuela's oil industry wants foreign partners to help tap its vast resources, but they need not come knocking if they want to call the shots, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday in Houston.
20315	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"We want partnerships with private companies, but with that rule," he said.
20320	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said he has not encountered hostility from Americans despite Washington's chilly relations with Chavez, a socialist who once likened President Bush to the devil.
20321	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"At least they know who Chavez is," he said during the meeting with the Chronicle.
20325	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Chavez had issued a decree mandating the turnover.

20332	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, spokesmen for the companies couldn't be reached or declined comment on Alvarez's statements or ongoing compensation talks.
20336	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez said Venezuela is especially interested in attracting investment from smaller businesses, and ones owned by blacks and Hispanics.
20337	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez also said oil services providers, such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, can fill the gap of technical expertise left by pullouts of international oil companies.
20341	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"Frankly I think ConocoPhillips' and Exxon Mobil's refusal to accept new contracts has shown there are certain limits to how far Venezuela can take the game," Esteruelas said.
20343	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Also, Esteruelas noted that in mid-May, the Venezuelan government said it might take over 18 oil rigs now operated by oil service companies and create a PDVSA subsidiary to tighten control of drilling operations throughout the country.
20345	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	If compensation talks fail and ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil turn to international arbitration, Venezuela has something to lose.
20346	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Its American assets -- notably five refineries run by its Houston-based subsidiary, Citgo -- could be targeted for seizure to compensate ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.
20347	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	Alvarez was unconcerned about that possibility.
20348	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	He said he hoped compensation talks would succeed, rendering the lengthy, expensive arbitration process unnecessary.
20349	NYT_ENG_20070711.0226.LDC2009T13	"It is the best for everybody else to go and reach an agreement," he told the Chronicle.

20359	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The fate of Ireland's largest pharmaceutical company rests with Tysabri, which appears finally on the verge of attaining Elan's ambition of a "blockbuster" drug that exceeds US$1 billion (the equivalent of euro650,000) in annual sales.
20361	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Chief Financial Officer Shane Cooke said Elan hoped to reach 100,000 Tysabri customers by the end of 2010, while current projections pointed to 90,000.
20364	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	But Elan and Biogen have reported no new cases since Tysabri's return to the market under restricted conditions in June 2006.
20367	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	such combined therapy has been banned since 2005.

20376	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	The drug has already advanced to a final round of clinical trials.

20382	APW_ENG_20080724.1214.LDC2009T13	Traders attributed the fall to profit-taking, wider market losses and analyst concerns that next week's Alzheimer's data might deliver mixed news.

20392	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	The decision to challenge the term-limits law, which was twice approved by New York voters, represents a remarkable about-face for Bloomberg.
20393	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	He has repeatedly said he supports such constraints on elected leaders, dismissed the idea that anyone is indispensable and once called an effort to revise it by the New York City Council "disgusting."
20395	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	His staff is drafting an unusual bill that would apply only to those currently in office, allowing them to serve three terms instead of two.

20404	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	On Wednesday, the editorial board of The New York Times will call for abolishing term limits.
20408	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his spokesman did not return several e-mail messages and telephone calls.
20409	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks, Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again.
20416	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	At charity balls and on golf courses, executives like the financier Steve Rattner, the developer Jerry I. Speyer and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch have encouraged him to seek a third term.
20418	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Bloomberg took pains to project an image of authority on the economy, trading telephone calls with chief executives of Wall Street firms, traveling to Washington to meet with federal regulators and appearing on "Meet the Press" to field questions about the financial crisis.
20419	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Closer to home, he has warned of gaping budget deficits and warned that he would probably raise property taxes by 7 percent as soon as January.
20420	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	"He has the confidence of the business community and the executive ability to run the city," said Steve Ross, the chief executive of Related Cos., a major developer in the city.
20428	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	A New York Times survey of City Council members in early September found that a majority were willing to amend the term- limits law, in order to allow Bloomberg and the council -- two- thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 -- a third term.
20429	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	What's more, the council committee that must first approve such a bill is run by Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally.
20430	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Over the last seven years, the mayor has directed millions of dollars in city money to community groups supported by Felder, according to city records.

20436	NYT_ENG_20080930.0156.LDC2009T13	Given Bloomberg's popularity and significant financial advantage, they may choose to sit out the mayoral campaign race once he enters the race, political analysts said.

20566	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	Western Kentucky used a full-court, aggressive scheme predicated on running and trapping.
20567	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA preferred a more deliberate pace, stifling teams with aggressive half-court defense.
20569	NYT_ENG_20080328.0036.LDC2009T13	UCLA survived scary second- half moments Thursday night to advance to the regional final with an 88-78 victory.

20605	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	With world bullion prices hitting new highs, gold futures made a strong debut on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SFE) on Wednesday.
20606	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The contract offers China a chance to become a key player in the global gold market.
20608	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The key contract for June delivery was the first to take off, surging 9.98 percent to 230.95 yuan (about 31.65 U.S. dollars) per gram.
20609	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	This was followed by the daily limit rise of other contracts for July-to-December delivery.
20616	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	China gold futures trading was launched as international gold prices have repeatedly hit new highs.
20617	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Global prices jumped more than 30 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1979.
20618	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Gold prices climbed more than 2 percent on Tuesday against strong oil prices and a weakening U.S. currency.
20619	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	A troy ounce of gold for February delivery added 18.3 U.S. dollars to settle at 880.30 U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
20620	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Last month, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the launch of gold futures trading.
20621	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	It was the fifth new futures product approved last year after zinc, rapeseed oil, polyethylene and palm oil.
20622	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The SFE, one of China's major futures trading venues, previously traded copper, aluminum, zinc, natural rubber and fuel futures.
20624	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Live pig futures will also be launched to help stabilize pork prices.
20626	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	Shang Fulin, CSRC chairman, stressed the financial nature of the precious metal and called for "joint efforts for the stable operation" of the new product at the launching ceremony in Shanghai.
20627	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	He said gold futures would improve the country's domestic gold market and pricing mechanism and provide options for financial institutions, gold producers and consumers to protect against market risk.
20629	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	"Most new futures investors would be institutions seeking a hedging tool," said Zhang Yingying, a Galaxy Futures Broker gold analyst.
20633	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	The China Securities Journal also reported people lining up outside futures brokers to open accounts in eastern Zhejiang Province.
20634	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, "I would first offer risk education to veteran stock investors, since even they lacked the experience for riskier futures trading," Zhao told Xinhua.
20636	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	However, the regulators were trying to discourage such clients, fearing that some might take on risks they couldn't handle.
20639	XIN_ENG_20080109.0113.LDC2009T13	And, as noted, the increase in the contract size -- from 300 grams to 1,000 grams -- was another attempt to limit individuals' participation.

20666	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	President George W. Bush, on a surprise visit to Iraq Monday, said a reduction in combat troops was possible but sniped at "nervous" US politicians ahead of a showdown with Congress.
20668	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	He convened a meeting of his "war council" with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders just days before US commander General David Petraeus and US Ambassador Ryan Crocker report to Congress on the progress of Bush's troop "surge" strategy.
20669	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker tell me if the kind of success we are now seeing (in Anbar) continues, it is possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer American forces," Bush said before leaving Iraq a few hours later for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Australia.
20673	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The White House is to make a formal report to Congress by September 15 aimed at persuading US lawmakers to continue funding the Iraq war, four and a half bloody years since the US-led invasion of 2003.
20675	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Waiting for him were US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Fallon, the commander of US forces in the Middle East, and Petraeus.
20676	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Hadley said Bush was trying to frame the debate that will follow the Petraeus- Crocker report to Congress by spotlighting what he sees as improved security.
20679	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"That's what will begin to play out when General Petraeus returns to Washington and begins his testimony to Congress."
20681	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Opposition Democrats who control the House of Representatives and Senate have been pushing for months to force a deadline for US troops to leave.
20685	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"In other words, when we begin to draw down troops from Iraq, it will be from a position of strength and success, not from the position of fear and failure."
20686	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Travelling to Anbar rather than Baghdad gave Bush an opportunity to highlight the dramatic shift in sentiment in the province.
20687	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Gates said the general view was that security has improved not just in Anbar but in other parts of Iraq as well as a result of the surge.
20688	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"Clearly there is hard work that remains to be done in some (areas) but the situation elsewhere is in pretty good shape," Gates told reporters.
20690	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	In Baghdad, police found 15 corpses of men shot dead.
20691	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	The president's visit came just hours after 500 British troops slipped out of their last base in Basra Palace under cover of darkness, leaving behind a city in the grip of a brutal militia turf war.
20696	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	Locals cheered the withdrawal, despite warnings the city could descend further into chaos.
20697	AFP_ENG_20070903.0070.LDC2009T13	"We are happy to be rid of the British.

20793	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	A string of bombings killed at least 15 people Monday in the Baghdad area, a day after a massive car bomb attack in a Shiite area market delivered the first major blow to the U.S.-led security crackdown.
20798	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The compound was cordoned off by U.S. soldiers.

20811	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	The latest attacks were a sobering reminder of the huge challenges confronting any effort to rattle the well-armed and well-hidden insurgents.

20814	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Nearly 130 people were injured.
20816	APW_ENG_20070219.0628.LDC2009T13	Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki condemned the bombing as a desperate act by "terrorists" and "criminals" who sense they are being squeezed.

20838	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Anna Galloway keeps a watchful eye on interest rates and stays in touch with her mortgage broker because she is eager to refinance the "jumbo" loan on her Charles County, Md., home.
20839	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"But I haven't even bothered to try to refinance yet because I know the jumbo rates are too high right now," said Galloway, 37, a legal secretary.
20841	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That drop may be coming soon.
20845	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Lenders responded by raising rates.
20846	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	And plenty of people in high-cost areas such as Washington got shut out of the housing market or, like Galloway, lost their chance to refinance into cheaper loans.
20848	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	That's up from the previous $417,000 cap, which was tied to the average home price nationwide.
20849	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The amount would vary so that the most expensive areas would qualify for bigger loans.
20852	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The two companies are federally chartered, which means many investors treat their loans as if they have the government's implicit guarantee.
20854	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Mortgage industry experts said the change should encourage lenders to lower jumbo rates.
20856	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The most we can say right now is that there will be some opportunity for some borrowers to achieve perhaps some interest- rate relief on their jumbo mortgages," said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates, a New Jersey-based mortgage research firm.
20859	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Within these parameters, the limit cannot drop below $417,000 nor exceed $729,750.
20860	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	The Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of calculating the limits
20862	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	It will take several more weeks before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can begin to purchase the loans
20863	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	first they must sort through internal logistical and operational issues.
20864	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Many analysts expect limits to increase in about 20 metropolitan areas, mostly pricey markets on the East and West coasts.
20868	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"There are markets where the average home price is well below $417,000, so they do not need any kind of boost."
20870	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She owes about $448,000 on her house.
20871	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	She has an adjustable-rate mortgage and wants to refinance before that loan resets, possibly to a higher level.
20873	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	In the past, lenders charged about 0.25 percentage point more for 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo loans than they did for smaller loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards.
20875	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Last week, the rates on conforming loans averaged 5.77 percent, while those on jumbo loans averaged 6.7 percent.
20876	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Although the aim of the changes is to reduce that gap, investors have become so skittish about jumbos that there's no telling how they will react if the large loans are mixed in with more traditional conforming loans, several industry analysts said.
20879	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	If investors feel that the larger loans inject too much risk into the pool of mortgages offered to them, they will demand a higher yield, which translates to higher rates for borrowers, said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of U.S. fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital.
20882	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"The investor will still be wary of (jumbo loans) even if they come with a Fannie or Freddie guarantee," Rajadhyaksha said.
20883	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	He said he expects the spread between existing jumbos and conforming loans to return to about 0.25 percentage points.
20885	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	"That can be a pretty big number because we're talking about markets with expensive homes."
20886	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	For instance, a half-percentage-point drop in the rate on a $500,000 mortgage shaves about $200 off monthly payments, said Retsinas, who serves on Freddie's board.
20888	LTW_ENG_20080219.0041.LDC2009T13	Potential borrowers with less- than-stellar credit will be turned away from any kind of loan these days, as will people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

20992	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	So comfortable was this win that Ferguson could afford to make three substitutions early in the second half when his side was already leading 3-0 to ensure fresh legs for the trip to face Roma in the Champions League quarter- final first leg in the Italian capital on Tuesday.
20993	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	An impressive early start from Villa suggested Martin O'Neill's side could make a contest of the game and possibly boost their own hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Cup.
20995	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	The home side's supremacy was confirmed 12 minutes before the interval when an exhilarating move took the ball from United's right hand flank to the left and back again before Ronaldo delivered a perfectly weighted far post cross that Tevez headed home.
20997	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	But that simply stirred United back into life and it took a superb reaction save from Villa keeper Carson to divert Ronaldo's volley onto the cross bar and deny the Portugese a second goal.
20998	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	That was only a brief reprieve for the visitors and within 60 seconds United had their third when Ronaldo again turned provider, flicking a long pass into the path of Rooney who rounded Carson and rolled the ball into an empty net.
20999	AFP_ENG_20080329.0084.LDC2009T13	And the England striker claimed his second, again courtesy of his in-form team- mate, when he collected Ronaldo's neat reverse pass and finished from close range.

21307	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	So far, it's hard to tell which will be a larger impediment to Democratic leaders: the McHenrys or the Sheehans.
21308	LTW_ENG_20070104.0108.LDC2009T13	The day began when House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam of Florida led fellow House GOP leaders to a news conference in a Capitol basement hall.

21492	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	The fast, forceful response from Google is a product of Schmidt's history and personality.
21493	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	Schmidt, 52, had spent much of his career battling Microsoft at Sun Microsystems and Novell, before joining Google in 2001.
21495	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	At Sun, he stood at an amused distance from the entertaining antics of the chairman, Scott G. McNealy, who railed against Microsoft and its leaders, Steven A. Ballmer and Bill Gates, as "Ballmer and Butthead."
21496	NYT_ENG_20080205.0181.LDC2009T13	During a four-year stint at Novell, Schmidt warned that it was foolhardy for any Microsoft rival to "moon the giant," as he put it, and incite Microsoft's wrath.
